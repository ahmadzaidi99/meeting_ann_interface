We're continuing our study on the economic security of women in Canada. \n              Today we have some excellent witnesses. From Pathways Health Centre for Children, we have Jenny Greensmith, the executive director, and Jennifer Howell, a parent adviser. By teleconference we have Alex Wilson, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan.\n              Welcome to our witnesses.\n              We'll start with Pathways Health Centre for Children for seven minutes, and then we'll go to Alex.\n              You may begin."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "233050", "name": "Ms. Jenny Greensmith (Executive Director, Pathways Health Centre for Children)", "contribution": "Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to speak today.\n              Marilyn, it's especially good to see you.\n              My role this morning is simply to set the stage and give you the context for the family experiences that Jennifer will share with you. \n              Situated in the city of Sarnia in southwest Ontario, Pathways is a provider of children's rehab and other educational services and supports to about 2,400 children and their families. We've been helping families in our community for over 40 years. Our families are a mix of urban and rural, and from all socio-economic groupings. We have an indigenous urban population in Sarnia, and three first nations within Lambton County. Sarnia is gradually becoming more ethnically diverse, although it still lags behind major urban areas. The major wave of immigrants who stayed and prospered in the area came from Europe. Lambton College brings in students of all nationalities, but we find that for the most part they do not stay in the area once their studies are done. They tend to move to the larger urban areas, where jobs are more plentiful and there are larger populations with similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds for them to blend into.\n              We are aware of Pathways families from all of these various groupings who live in poverty and must miss scheduled assessments and therapy sessions because they need to get from one side of town to the other using our limited public transportation to access the social welfare they and their families must rely on. We are aware that indigenous families living in first nation communities lack the transportation to come to locations where we offer service. We're trying to address this within our limited resources, because we understand that we will be able to reach out to those families more easily in locations where they feel culturally safe. More than anything, we are aware that having a child with a disability takes its toll on the family unit and that the burden of care may fall on a single parent, very often the mother.\n              Sarnia-Lambton has been hard hit economically over a number of years, most especially recently with the slump in oil prices. Despite ongoing initiatives to diversify our economy, the big companies in what is known as “chemical valley” are still among our mainstay employers. Fast facts from the Sarnia-Lambton workforce development board tell us that in March 2017, Sarnia-Lambton had the highest unemployment rate, at 8%, in the Erie-St. Clair region, higher even than Windsor, at 6.5%. Board reports over the years have documented the low education of the Sarnia-Lambton population. Most jobs with good chances of employment require trades, college, or university training or education. Sarnia-Lambton needs more people with post-secondary education in diverse fields. The lack of up-to-date qualification and recent work experience presents a significant barrier for women who have taken time out of the workforce, often many years, to care for their children, youth, or adult children with disabilities. We would like to ask whether such women have ever been the focus of research as to their experience when they must try to re-enter the workforce. \n              Well, as I said at the beginning, my role is to set the stage for you to understand more about the experiences of a few local women and the impact of their situation on their economic status.\n              Over to you, Jen."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "233053", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Howell (Parent Advisor, Pathways Health Centre for Children)", "contribution": "When asked to help with this topic, I looked back at my own life and the economic security of my own career. \n              When my husband and I were faced with the life-altering news that our son had autism, the demands were overwhelming from our appointments with developmental pediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, Autism Ontario, audiologists, and day care and school meetings. Phone calls from the day care and school requesting that I pick my child up were using up my sick days and vacation time. The demands and barriers of having a child with a disability fell heavily on my lap, as my husband's job had a higher salary. \n              I walked away from my career, benefits, and a pension. The financial burden quickly surfaced, as additional private support comes at a cost. Private speech and occupational therapy can cost anywhere from $100 to $150 per hour. Slowly we were going into debt. \n              When the position as parent adviser became available, I was able to make it work with its flexibility and decreased hours so I could still support my son. To have a job, a loving husband, and the support of my family makes me a minority in this situation.\n              I've also reached out to a parent who is a crisis caseworker at the Ontario Works department. She informed me of some barriers that she commonly sees for women who have a child with a disability. There are constant phone calls from the day care and school, demanding that the mother come to pick up her child. This creates overwhelming stress on the woman's job, and the end result is either that the mother is fired or needs to leave because the demands are too great.\n              If a mother seeks other employment, the job is lower paying with no benefits. The family is now living in poverty and the cycle begins. For example, transportation is a major barrier for a lot of these women as they may not have a vehicle, so taking public transportation is their only means. A child's appointment that would take one hour will now take three to four, which again adds the stress if the mother is working. Living conditions also dramatically change, as a mother and her family will need to reside in low-income housing. This presents new challenges and stresses on an already depleted mother. \n              For a woman to qualify for Ontario Works, her assets need to be below $2,500. A single parent with one child will receive under $1,000 a month to live on. Once a woman lives in poverty she is faced with additional barriers, which create new struggles that keep her in poverty. A lot of these women are not receiving the funding resources that could help them, or they do not have the strength or the energy to pursue them. Their focus is just to survive.\n              I've had the honour of hearing two client stories that I will share with you. The people's names have been changed to protect their privacy. Sara, the first mom, is a single mom with five children. One child was diagnosed with autism, and sensory processing and selective mutism disorder. Sara is divorced and receives no financial support from the father and no financial or emotional support from her family. Appointments and calls from the school demanding that her child be picked up put her in a stressful position with her employer. She lived in fear of being fired. Sara then took a pay cut and resorted to working straight midnights so she would be available for her child and the school. This took a toll on Sara and she ended up getting hurt on the job and receiving WSIB. Sara also had to drain her investments, like her RRSPs, as the financial needs were too great. She was receiving some financial support for her disabled son through special services at home, but the rest of her children were doing without. She is lost to what the future holds for her and her family.\n              Lori, the second mother, is a single mom with two children. Her one child was born legally blind and has cerebral palsy. Lori does not receive any financial support from the child's father and no financial or emotional support from her family. She truly feels alone. Lori was bombarded with doctors' appointments and had to take extended maternal leave to care for her son. When she returned to work, she was faced with the following barriers: her work hours, the demands of her child's needs, and the lack of flexibility at her job. Not wanting to resort to Ontario Works, Lori looked for employment elsewhere. Lori is presently employed as a PSW and works long hours to make ends meet. Her present job does give some flexibility, but her hours are unpredictable; and health care benefits, which are assessed every six months, rely on the amount of hours worked. \n              \n               Lori shared with me that there have been times when she has worked 127 hours in two weeks, and other weeks less than 30. If her hours are less than 30, Lori and her family will not receive health care benefits for six months until they are reassessed again. No matter what the socio-economic status is of women with a child who has a disability, they all share a common theme, and that is that the security of their career is jeopardized. We live in a two-income based society. Without the proper financial and emotional support, these women fall through the cracks. \n              Thank you for your time."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              We're going now to Alex by teleconference from the University of Saskatchewan. You have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "233176", "name": "Dr. Alex Wilson (Professor, University of Saskatchewan, As an Individual)", "contribution": "Tanisi. Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to speak today.\n              The information that I'm providing and my statement are based on my own research, on research that others have conducted, on my observations of the experiences of friends, family, and community members, and on my own experiences as a two-spirit-identified Cree woman. \n              I'm from the Opaskwayak Cree nation, and that's where I'm talking to you from today. We're a community of about 5,700 people 500 kilometres north of Winnipeg. Of our membership, approximately one-third do not live on reserve but mostly in cities across Canada, but also elsewhere in the world. \n              I began by telling you where I'm from because it is important to note that Cree people have lived in this area for a long time. In fact, like all other indigenous communities in North America, we have lived continuously on our land longer than any other people on the planet, with the exception maybe of indigenous Australians. With that long connection to the land, we have an intimate and important understanding of and connection to the land that extends back tens of thousands of years. \n              For all those thousands of years, our community has not only survived, but thrived. Every person had importance within the community and familial life. Within a very, very short period of time, the last 200 years or so, all that changed. Of course, what I'm referring to is the process of colonization, or what others call the “founding” of Canada. \n              There are two stories, the story that I and other indigenous women know and the story that is presented to Canadians, or the story of Canada. We were asked to make a statement about poverty and the impacts on indigenous women. However, we cannot talk about poverty without acknowledging that poverty is a symptom or a result of an intersection of a host of factors such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other forms of systemic oppression. \n              The lives of indigenous women have been regulated by policy since the founding of Canada. Every aspect of our lives has been regulated, such as what we eat, whom we are allowed to marry, where we live, what we are allowed to own, what we wear, and even who gets to use the term “Indian”, who gets to call themselves Indian. We know the effect of this regulation and of the intersections of multiple forms of oppression. The effect is evident in the many statistics that most of you already know or probably have some familiarity with, just like I know, when I take a taxi in Winnipeg, I will most likely have to pay up front, just like I continually have to worry about the safety of my nieces. \n              The effect of colonization is asymmetrical. Certain bodies are impacted in ways that others aren't, and those are the bodies of indigenous women, two-spirit, and trans indigenous people. The effect is institutionalized, and the effect has meant a disconnection from meaningful relationships, including to the land and water, which leads to destruction of land and water, to violence, the effect of the normalization of violence, and the internalization of violence. \n              It's meant that language has been lost or changed. It's meant that binary gender roles have been entrenched. It's meant that spirituality has now become a religion and institutionalized by schools, prisons, CFS, and the health care system. It's meant that certain world views have been privileged while others have been dismissed, in particular, the world views of indigenous women. This is the reality that we live with.\n              \n               As all of you know, there are over 1,200 missing or murdered indigenous women in Canada. Seven out of 10 aboriginal girls will experience sexual abuse or violence in their lives. Aboriginal women are 3.5 times more likely to experience intimate partner violence. For indigenous queer youth, the suicide rates are unimaginable—10 times higher than any other group. For indigenous trans-identified youth, suicide rates are around 56%, which means that if you know any indigenous trans-identified youths, the chances are that they will have either thought about suicide or attempted suicide. We see trans-identified indigenous youth leaving school as early as the third grade. Think about that. Why would a third grader not feel safe in school?\n              We have states of emergency around suicide. Homelessness rates are increasing. These are all the effects of colonization. These are the facts of life for indigenous women in Canada. Whether we are Cree, Inuit, Anishinabe, Métis, Coast Salish, or from whatever nation, the effect is the same across the country. But there is nothing inherently wrong with indigenous women. If we just looked at the statistics, if we just looked at the way Canada presents indigenous women, people would think there is something inherently wrong with us, and it's quite amazing that we are still here today despite the intersection of all of these multiple forms of oppression.\n              I would say that there is nothing inherently wrong with indigenous women. There is something inherently wrong with Canada.\n              In conclusion, I urge you, as representatives of Canada, to seriously consider how poverty fits into the bigger picture of the story of Canada. \n              Thank you."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.

When, let's say, a mother has a child with a disability and needs to resort to OW for support, the staff there has not been trained to help support this family as to what other financial resources are available for disabled children. It's about looking at these different agencies that a mother might be looking to for support, so that they are also trained to give the whole picture of what's available for these families.\n              Also, the tax credits do not work if a mother is not working, so perhaps a supplemental benefit would really help a lot of these families."}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "224981", "name": "Mr. Marc Serré", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              Ms. Wilson, you very eloquently explained several issues related to many of the first nations and Inuit across Canada. We've heard testimony in other committees and here on that. I can't imagine the struggles and challenges you face daily. At the end of your testimony, you mentioned poverty. If we look at indigenous poverty, especially of women, what would you recommend that the federal government specifically look at to support indigenous women and get them out of poverty?"}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "233176", "name": "Dr. Alex Wilson", "contribution": "That's a huge question, with many different ways to respond. Fundamentally, we have to examine the relationship between Canada and indigenous women. For example, to go back to the treaties and the Indian Act, the Indian Act dictates every aspect of our life. It even dictates what kind of glasses I can pick when I go to an optometrist. We have to look at the regulations or policies that continually regulate our bodies, meaning the Indian Act and the treaties.\n              For me, health care is supposed to be a treaty right, yet I use my insurance from work because I know that if I need to have dental work done and I use my treaty rights to health care for dental care, the treatment is going to be substandard treatment because they allow only certain things to be done, etc. For people who are living well below the poverty level, it's impossible to get proper health care. That was brought up in the other presentation.\n              My main recommendation would be to go to the fundamental policies that are impacting indigenous women, such as the Indian Act and treaty rights. The truth and reconciliation framework provides some guidance around principles. There are calls to action, but in the introduction to the report there is a good section about rethinking the relationship between Canada and indigenous people."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "224981", "name": "Mr. Marc Serré", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              I don't have time, but I would love to get your thoughts on whether we should make changes to the Indian Act or just get rid of it.

Particularly, of course, it has a significant impact on a single mom, who doesn't have the support of a spouse or a partner in that relationship and in raising the child. I'm wondering if you can paint a bit more of a picture in terms of the direct impact this has on a mom. She is working; maybe she has spouse support, maybe not. She is also the primary caregiver to a child living with a disability, and she is trying to make life work.\n              What does that look like for a mom?

I can tell you that in all seriousness. \n              We are currently rolling out a couple of initiatives within the province of Ontario, one to coordinate service planning for families with children with complex special needs and another to integrate rehab services. Throughout the engagement with families prior to and during the implementation of those initiatives, we have heard from families how confusing it is, how they don't know where to go, and my colleague Jenny referred to the Ontario Works caseworker, who was also using her own research to try to find out where to go.\n               If professionals don't know where to go, just think how much harder it is for the family. They land somewhere but they are always second-guessing if they got to the right place, was there someone else they could have accessed, was there something they could have done better for their child? \n              I think that's probably what I can share with you about what I know of the impacts.

I've had some families that just can't manage. \n              When they do receive funding, there are a lot of barriers and stipulations around it, and then there's the paperwork. I'll give you a scenario for the latter. A portion of the form for a disability tax credit, for instance, needs to be filled out by a doctor. You have a family that's already strapped for income; they go to get this filled out and it can cost them anywhere from $50 to $100. I've had families walk away because they cannot afford it. Furthermore, with a lot of these funding papers, a family also needs to provide documentation from their doctor, from their developmental pediatrician, or a psychologist, and there's also a price tag attached to that, which is a barrier. I've had some families that can't afford the doctor's note, or for the doctor to fill it out. Then they come back and we have to look at third-party funding. That's a whole new step and a lot of families don't have the energy and give up, meaning they have no access to that funding. \n              There's the time consumed with appointments. A lot of the treatment will happen as a block, and the demands will be such that maybe a couple of times a week, or weekly, a mother or caregiver will need to devote that time to the child.

What would that look like in a holistic Canadian approach?"}, {"turn": 21, "speakerID": "233176", "name": "Dr. Alex Wilson", "contribution": "To begin with, there has to be some kind of acknowledgement of the history that's happened. I know that sounds basic, but as an educator who teaches incoming first-year students and graduate students, you'd be surprised at how many 18- and 19-year-olds have no clue about the history of Canada in relation to indigenous peoples. They don't know about the residential school era. They don't know about the sixties scoop. They're continually getting fed stereotypes that they find on social media or even that they're taught in school.\n              Education, I think, is a foundational piece for awareness. Whether that's formal education through the K to 12 and the post-secondary system, or informal education through social movements or community organizations, I think there really needs to be a focus on that. That's the beginning, I would say.\n              The other thing is an acknowledgement that there is an imbalance in power. This is the committee on the status of women, where most of us are aware of the dynamics of domestic violence, for example, and that domestic violence is a gendered phenomenon whereby women are impacted in a different way from men. It's predominantly women who are the victims of domestic violence.\n               If you think of a violent relationship, there are two parties in it. Imagine saying to a couple, after a woman has experienced domestic violence, that they should get back together, get along, and move forward. A similar thing has happened with the relationship between indigenous peoples and Canada, the result of an unequal balance of power and the violence enacted on indigenous people, with indigenous women mostly feeling the effect of that.\n               So there has to be another acknowledgement that this unequal power relationship means that great care has to taken when making reparations around this relationship. I say so because telling two people just to get back together and start moving forward really undermines the self-worth of that person—or in this case of an entire group of people. They can be viewed as less than human, and that's certainly how we have been treated."}, {"turn": 22, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "We're going now to Ms. Malcolmson for seven minutes."}, {"turn": 23, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson (Nanaimo—Ladysmith, NDP)", "contribution": "Thank you, Madam Chair.\n              Professor Wilson, I was ashamed to learn on Friday at a KAIROS blanket exercise for reconciliation on the Hill that indigenous people who earned a degree—to be a teacher, engineer, doctor, or whatever—were forced to give up their Indian status. \n              Everybody around the room is looking surprised by that, too. I had no idea. What a total calamity for the economy and discrimination. I'm embarrassed on behalf of the country, but I am embarrassed that as a legislator I didn't know that before.

I believe that as we speak, there's a committee meeting right now on this topic. \n              Moreover, if you received an education you were enfranchised or assimilated as a Canadian. I haven't seen anybody who actually lost their status because they got a bachelor's degree or a mainstream education, so I don't know of any cases in which that actually happened, even though that was written into the Indian Act.\n              One thing that did impact people, though, is funding. If you were a first nations person and went to university, by the treaties you were supposed to be provided with financial support for education. That was challenged in the 1960s. In fact, my dad was one of the first people to challenge it when he went to the University of Saskatchewan, because the rationale was given that, for people of the time, the average education would be a grade 8, so he had already exceeded the expectations for an Indian. They were able to successfully challenge that. \n              Post-secondary funding is still unequal and still not up to par with what it should be. In fact, there hadn't been a change in the funding structure since 1992. That creates an unequal dynamic around access to education."}, {"turn": 25, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "That then has attendant economic consequences.\n              Thank you, thank you for your work.\n              I'm going to turn to the witnesses from Pathways Health Centre for Children.\n              In committee last week, we heard from women who bravely came to testify about some of the very same effects you have described. They are parents just caught in a never-ending cycle of having to care for children who are very ill or are living with disabilities, and having to leave their work and falling into poverty.\n              This particular group, Parents jusqu'au bout, described providing 24-7 care. We also heard that in addition to the challenge of navigating the complex benefits system that you've described, that their children may become ineligible as they pass the age of 18. They also said that the women themselves don't make enough money to pay income tax, and so the federal tax rebates that were set up to support their families are actually irrelevant to them. The rebate is a non-offer.\n              Can you describe any recommendations you have the federal government to make changes so that we could better support parents caring for children with disabilities by their having access to stable benefits?"}, {"turn": 26, "speakerID": "233050", "name": "Ms. Jenny Greensmith", "contribution": "We did talk to each other about this before this morning. We are not necessarily an organization that has a lot to do with federal benefits, being funded provincially through the Ministry of Children and Youth Services. \n              As you say, tax rebates are fine if you pay tax. There is a gap between what children are eligible for now and what they're eligible for once they turn 18, 19, or 21, depending on what the cut-off is. It crosses social welfare. It crosses health. It crosses education. Parents often feel that this is a point where they need to pull back on their work hours. To be honest, they have respite when their children are in school all day. When their children leave school and are not intellectually able to participate in some of the college programs, there is little else. Often there is not enough money to keep that young adult stimulated and socially part of a group. Parents at that point may need to pull back on their work hours or simply decide that one parent—and very often there aren't two parents—will need to stay home with the young adult because they cannot be left home alone.\n              Perhaps we should address that, maybe with a supplementary benefit of some sort. Often these benefits are tied to the child, the young adult, the ODSP recipient.

I just went to the website as we were talking, and looked at it in terms of a single woman with a disabled child and a variety of other things, such as wanting to go back to school, and as someone who was renting. There were 48 different sites that it sent me to. That said, if someone has a disabled child and is already having an issue, there are 48 websites they have to go to in order to do research.

She was talking about navigating the system and how difficult it is with all the barriers in place.\n              One of the things our Liberal government is proud of is getting rid of boutique tax credits. There were tax credits for sports. There were tax credits for all sorts of different things for families, but most families couldn't access those because their income was too low. They couldn't even put their kids in organized sports. What we did was take those funds and put them all into the Canada child benefit, making it tax free and providing as much money as we could to families with children, especially single moms. It raised 320,000 children out of poverty. That was a good initiative, and that is the type of approach we should take to bringing down those barriers. \n              I think of some of the other programs we have. I read an article recently in the Toronto Star  or the The Globe and Mail about the registered disability savings plan. It allows you to have a registered account if you have a child with a disability—but it's so challenging. It was put in by the late Jim Flaherty, but almost nobody accesses it because it is so hard to do. You have to go through so much paperwork. You need accountants. This needs to be streamlined. It has to be made easier so families that really need it can access those things. I think this is the approach we need to take. Is that what you're thinking needs to be done?"}, {"turn": 62, "speakerID": "233053", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Howell", "contribution": "Yes. For instance, speaking about the registered disability savings plan, to access that, first of all, a family needs to have the disability tax credit. Now we're faced with the first barrier, which I mentioned earlier: the form needs to be filled out by a doctor, so there's a fee. For those families that can't afford that fee, then they're not eligible for the registered disability savings plan.\n              Then, if they do have it, one, a lot of the banks don't have the proper information about how to run a registered disability plan, and two, a lot of these families don't have the money to put in. One thing I do try to tell the families is that they might only be eligible for three years, because with the disability tax credit now, depending on the disability, they're strict with autism now. That family has to now reapply and pay another doctor to fill out that form. \n              Families have been told that you have to put money into the registered disability savings plan, but in fact you don't have to right away if you don't have the funds. But once they get that disability tax credit, they should try to connect, and I've tried to supply resources for them to get the accurate information. They should open the account, have it available, because three years from now, if their child does not qualify for the disability tax credit, no on can take away their registered disability savings plan. Again, that key piece is that families don't know, or financially they can't support."}, {"turn": 63, "speakerID": "214019", "name": "Mr. Peter Fonseca", "contribution": "I'm thinking of another one, the Canada learning bond, which is available to those families with very low income.

Many of the programs that are being put in place are for those who really have the resources, the wherewithal, and the know-how; they are not who we're trying to help. \n              What would be the answer, the approach? Would government look to streamline those services to make them a lot easier? Would it be able to provide advocates to help navigate the system? How can we make it better, so that we do get the type of numbers that avail themselves of those programs?"}, {"turn": 64, "speakerID": "233050", "name": "Ms. Jenny Greensmith", "contribution": "From my perspective, leading an organization, I would say that I hear most often from families, “We don't know where to go.

We'll explain some of the reasons why that is the case.\n              In the study that will be the focus of most of what we will be talking about today, we used 2006 census data to really paint a picture of the labour market experience of racialized Canadians. We looked at a number of measures there to describe that.\n              What we found was that racialized Canadians are very willing to work. Both racialized men and women had higher labour force participation rates. If people are participating in the labour market, it either means they are employed or are actively looking for employment. Despite this willingness and eagerness to work, racialized Canadians had higher unemployment rates. In particular, racialized women had the highest unemployment rate of the four groups that we were looking at: 9.3%. We have to remember back to 2005. At that point, we were really in the midst of a boom in Canada. Still, racialized women had that higher unemployment rate.\n              We first looked at those broad aggregate numbers. What was the participation rate? What was the employment rate? What was the unemployment rate? Then we went in. We wanted to take a look at where racialized Canadians were working and how that differed from non-racialized Canadians. We were at a pretty high level of aggregation, but what it showed us was that there were some insights, even from this limited data. The first—which is very important, particularly 11 years later—was that there was an overrepresentation of racialized workers in private services. They were working as security guards, in janitorial services, in call services, etc.\n              That's the kind of work that is precarious. It is more likely to be at minimum wage, to have turnover and contracts, and to not have the kinds of supports and benefits found in what we describe as a more standard employment relationship. That is also the kind of work that has really expanded over the last ten years as we see more low-wage work and more precarious work.\n              We also saw at that time a concentration of both racialized men and women in manufacturing. We also know that industry has had a very tough time.\n              Something that I think is really important to note, particularly with regard to this group, is that there was an under-representation of racialized people in public administration. Public administration doesn't include health care or education. It really includes the people who are making policy and administering government programs. The lack of that perspective and voice in public administration is a concern for us.\n              With more direct regard to what I understand your committee is looking at, I will say that we also saw that the construction of gender differs between racialized and non-racialized women. You might ask what that means or how that plays itself out. What that really means is that racialized women are concentrated in different jobs and have different experiences, different concentrations of work. For example, racialized women were more likely to work in manufacturing and processing jobs than non-racialized women. Although both racialized and non-racialized women were under-represented in natural and applied sciences, racialized women were more likely to work in that field. Similarly, non-racialized women were more likely to work in education.\n              What this points out to us is the importance of really looking at women's experiences across the broad spectrum and not just looking at those averages. We have to disaggregate those experiences across a number of factors. We have to look at the experiences of indigenous women and racialized women. We also have to break apart those groupings of racialized women because we know that women from different racialized backgrounds have different experiences and different labour market experiences.\n              \n               We looked at who is working and who isn't working, access to employment, and where people are working. At the bottom line, we indicate average employment incomes. What that showed us is that racialized women earned 55.6¢ for every dollar that non-racialized men made. When you do that comparison, you can also say that racialized women earned 88¢ for every dollar that non-racialized women earned and 71¢ for every dollar that racialized men earned. We see that the combination of gender and racialization really has complex and disadvantageous impacts on racialized women in the labour market.\n              We're uncomfortable talking about labour market racism or perhaps any racism in Canada. Therefore, when we look at that labour market experience, there is a temptation for us to say that for all non-indigenous Canadians, for everybody who immigrates to this country, they struggle a bit—either the first generation, or they struggle the first few years—and then it's a level playing field. \n              What we wanted to look at with this data was immigrants who were racialized or non racialized. We controlled for age. We had only 25- to 44-year-olds, the people in their peak earning years, and people with a university degree or certificate. What we found was that the immigration experience is very different if you're racialized or if you're non-racialized. That difference continues between racialized and non-racialized immigrants, through to the second generation and continues to the third generation. This is not a problem of recent immigrants. This is really a problem of racism in the labour market. \n              Having already looked at the labour market experience and the income experience, then we're really looking at the next issue. What is the impact of this labour market discrimination on families? We found that racialized Canadians had three times the poverty rate of non-racialized families. Again, this was during the boom years, and as opposed to a 6.4% poverty rate, it's a 20% poverty rate.\n              That data for the national picture was from 2005 and we wanted to update it and the analysis using the national household survey data. We set out to write a paper that would update that data to see what the experience was post-recession, what the impact was, and whether things were better or worse. Instead, we wound up writing a paper about the problems with the national household survey data because there were just too many problems with it reliability for us to draw conclusions. We were very happy and relieved that the census had been reinstated and that we can go back to that analysis. \n              Just to give you something that's a little more up to date, we are looking at some analysis using another Stats Canada source, which is the “Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics”, and that data is from 2011. If you have 12-year-old data, the data are only six years out of date. It reinforces that racialized women are concentrated in low-wage work and that a higher share of racialized workers are working for minimum wage. When you break it down by gender and by racialization, the highest share of workers at minimum-wage jobs are racialized women.\n              On on page 12 we looked at the share of employees who were 25 years of age and over and low-wage workers, those within $4 of making the minimum wage. We found, once again, that racialized women were the most likely to be working for those low-wage jobs and that racialized men were also very likely to be doing this.\n              \n               We're going to move to what we want to leave you. \n              One of the things we want to say is that the availability of data is very crucial, because if you don't have the data you can't understand the problem and therefore give appropriate policy solutions. For example, we have a 10-year gap resulting from the national household survey, but until very recently we used to have annual data that had a variable describing racialization, so we could understand the labour market experience from year to year. I know you all have a lot of information. That was the “Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics”. When they switched to the “Canadian Income Survey”, they dropped the racialization variable. That is of extreme concern to us because it means that we are limited to an analysis every five years. As we and others have been urging StatsCan, we urge you to recommend that that survey be reinstated so that we can really understand what's happening in the labour market on a year-to-year basis. \n              While all three groups experience labour market discrimination, racialized women's experience differs from that of racialized men and non-racialized women. We really need to understand that through the data and really need policies that will address all of that complexity.\n              Now I'm going to pass to Professor Galabuzi."}, {"turn": 69, "speakerID": "232964", "name": "Prof. Grace-Edward Galabuzi", "contribution": "I think essentially the argument we're making is that we've established through the analysis that all three groups experience significant vulnerabilities, but in particular racialized women. These vulnerabilities arise from both their racialized and gendered identities. It is essential for the federal government to regulate the labour market in such a way that it addresses the precarious nature of the work that is available to them. \n              In terms of that regulation, we're thinking about some changes in labour law or women's standards that would address the experience of those who are under federal jurisdiction, but also provide leadership for the jurisdictions of the provinces so they can address that experience too. \n              We recognize that there is employment equity legislation at the federal level. There have been ongoing discussions about making changes to the legislation that might strengthen the associated regulation and ensure greater access to employment and equitable employment for all three groups, but in particular racialized women. I should not only say racialized women, but also indigenous women. \n              Pay equity is another area where we believe that there is some scope for making the experience of racialized women much more equitable than it is today. \n              We believe that other dimensions of policy that relate to the experience of access to employment, like child care for instance, also represent an opportunity to address that disproportionate experience. We also believe that one of the challenges in the labour market today is the extent to which employers have disproportionate power in their relationship with their employees. \n              Part of that has to do with the level of unionization. Unionization is significant lower that it has been in the past, especially in some of the areas of jurisdiction outside the public service. We believe, both from the point of view of access to unionization for those workers who have the vulnerabilities, but also dealing with the responsibility of the federal government to meet its obligations under international treaty, that it is essential for us to look at how we can regularize unionization to make it easier for under-represented groups to unionize. The three groups that we're talking about are likely to be less unionized than other groups. \n              I want to echo what Sheila just said about the question of data collection. Precisely because of this vulnerability arising from intersectional impacts, how we collect data is really important to our having a better understanding of that experience. I think it's essential for us to disaggregate the data so that we have data that explains the experience of particular groups in the labour market. In this case, without this disaggregated data, there is no way we can understand the challenges that particular groups face in the labour market.

After my triplets started school, I decided to go back to school. When I was getting my bachelor's degree, most of my colleagues were visible—or racial, as you say—minority women. I completed my bachelor's degree and then took a master's. Most of my classmates—about 75% of them—were visible minority women. In my first PhD course, we were four or five women, and all of us belonged to a visible minority.\n              So it is not a matter of language barriers or a lack of degrees. I was shocked to learn that, in 2011, 16.2% of Ontario's minimum wage employees were members of a visible minority. The situation does not only affect women; you said that both women and men were affected. As for the labour market, you mentioned that the unemployment rate in 2006 was really high, and that 9.3% of unemployed women belonged to a visible minority. So the unemployment rate is high, and the employment rate is too low.\n              Here is my question. According to you, what obstacles are visible minority Canadians, especially women, facing while trying to achieve greater economic security by entering the workforce? I am not talking only about women who have more of an opportunity to earn a degree, but also about those who are overqualified. Why do those obstacles exist?"}, {"turn": 132, "speakerID": "232963", "name": "Ms. Sheila Block", "contribution": "That's absolutely the question we're looking at here. It's when you are looking at people who have credentials who are facing this discrimination in the labour market. We're looking at systemic solutions. It's very important for those women who have had those opportunities, who are highly qualified or overqualified. We want to look at systemic solutions that have to do with affirmative action, employment equity, and other factors that have to do with recognition of international credentials as well.\n              We can look to the federal government and jurisdiction to provide leadership on this issue, push those policies further out into federally regulated labour markets, and raise the people at the top, the overqualified people. For those people who are at the bottom, what are the systemic issues we can address?\n              One of the things we haven't touched on as much is the fact that unionization very much reduces those pay gaps for racialized workers and women. Part of that has to do with the old boys' network that professor Galabuzi was referring to. When you have that transparency and a piece of paper where it's written that this is how much you earn if you're at this pay grade, it reduces a lot of those systemic discriminations. It doesn't reduce all of it, but makes big progress towards doing so."}, {"turn": 133, "speakerID": "232964", "name": "Prof. Grace-Edward Galabuzi", "contribution": "I will just add that underlying all of this is the undervaluation of both international qualifications and experience, and the overvaluation of Canadian experience and qualifications. This is really what we're talking about. We're talking about racialization, the association between a particular value of the human capital of people who are quote-unquote “racialized”, regardless of what their qualifications are, whether those qualifications are international or Canadian. Again, there is literature that shows that there are differences.\n              We talked about this earlier. The differences in terms of access to employment as well as compensation between racialized and non-racialized immigrants. Even at that level, there are disparities between racialized and non-racialized immigrants that relate to the undervaluation of racialized human capital."}, {"turn": 134, "speakerID": "215906", "name": "Mrs. Eva Nassif", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              I have another question.\n              In the study you carried out in 2011, titled Canada's Colour Coded Labour Market: The gap for racialized workers, you say that racial minority women are 48% more likely to be unemployed than men who do not belong to a visible minority. The study also shows that they earn 55.6% of the annual income that men who are not members of a racial minority earn. That's really shocking! What factors do you think contribute to that gap?\n              We are not talking about equivalencies for degrees from foreign countries. As I just said, those are women who were educated here, like myself. Many women who belong to a visible minority were educated here, at Canadian universities. They don't always have only one degree; they sometimes have two or three university degrees. That gap exists not only when it comes to getting a job or entering the workforce. There is also a wage gap that is completely shocking."}, {"turn": 135, "speakerID": "232964", "name": "Prof. Grace-Edward Galabuzi", "contribution": "That's what I'm talking about in terms of this question. A key factor is the undervaluation of the human capital of racialized workers. When employers make decisions around whom they're going to hire and whom they're going to pay at what rate, they take into account who is in front of them. They tend to undervalue the human capital of racialized groups.\n              We've done research that shows that the proportion of Ph.D.'s among immigrants, who have qualities that are largely racialized, is actually higher than the proportion of those with Ph.D.'s among the rest of the Canadian population. However, that does not translate into equal access to opportunities, or even compensation."}, {"turn": 136, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.\n              Now we'll go for five minutes to my colleague Ms. Harder."}, {"turn": 137, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              Can you help me out here?

We stepped back and said that we would look at the combination of these factors: the interaction of racism and sexism that happens in the educational system, the impact of racism and sexism that happens in the labour market, and the unequal division of domestic labour in the household. You take all of these factors together and you ask what the outcome is. The outcome, as your colleague said, was that racialized women earn 55.6% of what non-racialized men earn. While what you're asking is an important question, the data that we're using doesn't have the answer to that."}, {"turn": 139, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              You also stated in your presentation that all three groups experience labour market discrimination, but that racialized women have a different experience from non-racialized women and racialized men. I'm wondering if you can break down some of the specifics around that in terms of what the exact difference is with regard to racialized women. I guess I'm asking for anecdotes rather than numbers. I think we've explored the numbers. What does it look like when a woman goes in for an interview or when she is employed within a workplace? What does that difference in discrimination look like?"}, {"turn": 140, "speakerID": "232963", "name": "Ms. Sheila Block", "contribution": "You're the qualitative person. \n              I will pass that to my qualitative research colleague."}, {"turn": 141, "speakerID": "232964", "name": "Prof. Grace-Edward Galabuzi", "contribution": "I think I talked about this earlier on. The experience, particularly of immigrant women, most of whom are racialized, is that they have the responsibility for sexual reproduction in their home, so they have the responsibility of looking after the children. That has a very direct impact on their access to the labour market when opportunities arise. \n              In one of the studies we were doing over the last five years, we interviewed women who came here. In one case a woman had a master's degree and her husband had an undergraduate degree. They had to determine which of them would seek employment and which would be primarily responsible for sexual reproduction. What was interesting is that they were using temp agencies to get access to employment. Every morning they had to figure out who would go out and who would stay home. More often than not, the man went to work and the woman stayed at home.\n              The fact that women have what has been referred to as a “double shift”, a responsibility both in the labour market outside and at home, has a direct impact on their ability to earn. It also has a direct impact on their ability to utilize opportunities that may arise. That applies to all women, in some regard. This certainly applies to women who are working class, but the added factor here is the fact of racialization. They are existing at an intersection where the impact of racialization and gendered experience has a compounding effect on their ability to work, to have access to opportunities, as well as to earn."}, {"turn": 142, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "What can employers do to make a difference?"}, {"turn": 143, "speakerID": "232963", "name": "Ms. Sheila Block", "contribution": "I think employers can examine their hiring policies, they have to engage in training their HR staff, and they have to make sure they are taking positive measures.
