Now, if there's objectionable material that was put up without your consent, you have a button to notify them, and they will take the material down from their platform, from everyone's pages. They will also use face recognition software to take it off Instagram and any of the platforms they are in charge of.Kevin Chan cited the work of our committee.

You can begin."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "Thank you, Madam Chair.I would like to thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to present our views this morning.I would like to begin by saying a little bit about the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec.The FTQ is the largest union federation in Quebec. We represent more than 600,000 members. We represent the largest number of unionized women in Quebec: over 200,000. We also represent more than 125,000 members who work in federally regulated sectors.To advance women's economic security, the FTQ advocates acting simultaneously on several fronts; I will address six of them.The first point is recognition of the value of women's work. The federal government needs a proactive pay equity law now. We believe this would be one way of respecting women workers' right to a fair wage for the work they do. In Quebec, a law enacted in 1997 has significantly reduced the wage gap, which has gone from 16% in 1997 to 10% in 2015. I will not dwell on this point, but it is clearly one way to advance women's economic security.The second point is an increase in the minimum wage to $15 per hour. The FTQ fully supports that recommendation, which has also been made by the Canadian Labour Congress. We reiterate that, in an economic context where non-standard jobs and precarious employment are of growing importance, the federal government must set the tone by establishing a minimum wage of $15 per hour. We would point out that a very large number of women in Canada work for minimum wage. There are also men working for minimum wage, but women are affected more: nearly 60% of people who work for minimum wage are women. These women's work needs to be better recognized.Another effective way of advancing women's economic security is to balance work, family and school. This is an important lever for reducing inequality between men and women while producing positive effects on the economy. In Quebec, we have a family policy that includes child care, the Quebec parental insurance plan, which covers maternity and parental leave and work-family balance measures. I would like to address those elements one by one.First, a complete public network of high-quality reduced-contribution educational child care services is important, to support women and keep them in employment. In Quebec, this measure has markedly improved women's labour market participation rate for two decades. In the initial years of the plan, between 1997 and 2004, we saw a significant 10% increase in the presence of women in the labour market.This measure has also resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs in the child care industry. In its 2002-03 budget speech, Quebec's government indicated that subsidized child care had already led to the creation of 12,000 jobs, and, in 2014, 30,000 full-time jobs had been created in the industry.According to Statistics Canada, 45,000 people work in child care in Quebec. Over 90% of workers in this occupation are women. This is therefore an important issue. The industry is far from perfect in Quebec, but this measure has had a positive impact on women's employment.The other measure relates to maternity and parental leave, which has resulted in a significant increase in women's labour market participation rate in Quebec. This measure has been in place since 2006. The Quebec parental insurance plan allows 90% of new mothers in Quebec to receive parental benefits, versus 65% of Canadian women governed by employment insurance rules.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecently, the Quebec government did an evaluation, and the economic and social impacts were extremely positive.In addition, there is a widening gap between Quebec and the other Canadian provinces. For example, in a household with total income of $30,000 or less, mothers are more likely to take paid leave in Quebec than in the other provinces. In 2013, 85% of low-income women in Quebec had access to paid maternity leave, as compared with 44% of Canadian women.There is also the entire question of fathers. We can see the effects of this measure on fathers' participation when it comes to taking leave, whether paternity leave or parental leave. We see that the rate rose from 28% under the employment insurance plan in 2005 to 83% under the Quebec parental insurance plan in 2004. This is beneficial in terms of the role of parents and the division of labour in the home.There is also the entire question of adapting workplaces. This is an important measure. In Quebec, we work with the Coalition pour la conciliation famille-travail-études. For several years, we have been calling for framework legislation on family-work-school balance. Its aim would be to require employers to initiate a labour-management process with employees and the unions that represent them to determine the needs relating to family-work-school balance in each workplace and to put measures in place, with a focus on equality.Another element of this is the protective reassignment of pregnant or breastfeeding workers. In the last federal budget, we saw a measure referred to as protective withdrawal from work that covers up to 12 weeks before the due date rather than the eight weeks allowed at present. That does not trigger additional benefits for the claimant. In our opinion, this is not genuine protective withdrawal; it is disguised maternity leave. In Quebec, protective reassignment is not maternity leave and is not a social measure."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you.Your time is up."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "I have more to say, but you will be asking me questions."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Yes, that is right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t We will continue with Meg Gingrich for seven minutes as well."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "230662", "name": "Ms. Meg Gingrich (Research Representative, National Office, United Steelworkers)", "contribution": "Thank you.I'd like to thank everybody for the opportunity to speak today. I'm here from the United Steelworkers union. We represent about 220,000 active members in Canada. USW members are men and women of every social, cultural, and ethnic background, and virtually every industry and job. Over the years the steelworkers have developed courses for women to train other women in the union. We continue to work in politics and the community to advance the interests of all working women. We've submitted 10 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. They cover some of the same issues that were just spoken about, but they cover federal pay equity legislation, universal child care, secure pensions, and address gender violence. These areas all have an impact on the economic security of women.An unacceptable pay gap remains between men and women in every jurisdiction in Canada. At the federal level we believe it's absolutely essential to pass proactive pay equity legislation. We also know that legislation on its own doesn't necessarily eliminate the gap all of the way. We know that unions and collective bargaining have been important to reducing the wage gap. In terms of hourly wages, unionization diminishes the gap to close to 5%, from upwards of 15% to 20%, and then on an annual earnings basis, where the gap is much larger, unionization reduces it from over 30% to closer to 15%, which we recognize is still too high.Beyond wages, collective bargaining and unionization provide women with a protected collective voice to negotiate improved pensions and benefits, as well as flexibility to prevent the negative economic consequences that arise out of the unpaid labour that women are often expected to do and do perform in the domestic sphere. There are OECD studies that say that women in Canada report upwards of four hours of unpaid work on a daily basis, and that's close to two hours more than men report.We believe this is a contributing factor to women's economic inequality. It forces women to take on more part-time and insecure work that's often lower paid and with fewer workplace protections. For that reason, USW calls for an immediate increase to the federal minimum wage, to $15 an hour, and we further call for the protection and expansion of union rights.Close to 40% of women outside Quebec cannot access the current EI maternity and parental leave system, either because of a lack of eligible hours or because they simply cannot afford to take the leave based on their replacement rates.USW recommends a federal leave system that's more equivalent to the Quebec program, so an eligibility based on $2,000 of income during the eligibility period, a reduction of hours required to become eligible to 300, a longer eligibility period of up to five years. We also recommend raising income replacement for maternity and second parent leave to 70%. We're trying to get an equalization of care between parents, and we recommend a “use it or lose it” second parent leave, which would typically be the father, though not necessarily.Then, there are wage replacements and improved flexibility for compassionate care leave, as women take on the majority of all types of family care.Canada must go much further than it has to create a universal child care system as well, one that's accessible and affordable to all families. It must also be inclusive, regardless of ability; economic, cultural, or linguistic circumstances; location; or workforce status. It must also include a living wage for child care workers.Canada must also ensure equality of access to decent pensions that do not simply perpetuate the wage gap until death. USW applauds the recent CPP expansion and recommends that all provisions of CPP, including child-rearing and disability dropout provisions are included to ensure that women receive the full economic benefit of the expanded CPP.Old age security and the guaranteed income supplement eligibility must remain at 65, and there must be further work with the provinces to reduce social assistance and other clawbacks that arise from OAS and GIS payments.The steelworkers also ask for increased federal-provincial collaboration on apprenticeship programs and placements aimed at equity-seeking groups. We also call on the federal government to assess infrastructure investments through a gender and equity lens. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t We call on the government to invest in social infrastructure, such as affordable housing and public transportation, and we call for procurement provisions and policies that meet gender and equity standards with clear enforcement mechanisms and that do not simply continue occupational segregation.Women cannot achieve true economic equality and security if we do not also address the particular inequalities faced by indigenous women, black and other women of colour, women with disabilities, and LGBTQ women. Women facing multiple inequalities experience even larger wage gaps and are more likely to be in precarious work.Last but not least, Canada must protect and expand our public health care system by implementing a national pharmacare plan that is accessible, publicly funded, and publicly delivered.Finally, access to and protection of reproductive health services is essential to women's economic freedom and security.That concludes my remarks. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good. Thanks so much.We are now going to go to Debora De Angelis.You have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "230661", "name": "Ms. Debora De Angelis (Regional Director, Ontario, United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada)", "contribution": "Thank you. On behalf of the members of UFCW Canada, we welcome the opportunity to make recommendations to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women on how to improve women's economic security and ensure the equal participation of women in the Canadian economy.UFCW Canada is this country's leading private sector union, representing more than 250,000 workers throughout Canada. We are the leading force for workers in the retail, food processing, and hospitality sectors. Over 50% of UFCW Canada's members are women, and 40% of our members are under the age of 30. Close to 10,000 UFCW Canada members work in federally regulated sectors. They work in the security sector—for example, for G4S; in transportation; at Canadian Forces bases; in credit unions; in the fisheries sector; in the milling sector, including flour, grain, and malt; in the mining sector; and in other federally regulated workplaces. We applaud the federal government's commitment to take action to close the gender pay gap, including actions to reduce occupational segregation, reduce women's poverty, and eliminate sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. UFCW Canada recommends the following actions that the government can implement now to close the gender wage gap. Make closing the gender wage gap a human rights priority. We call for a proactive federal pay equity law modelled on the recommendations of the 2004 pay equity task force. UFCW joins other trade unions and pay equity advocates in calling for legislation this year. We call on the federal government to legislate a living wage. Women dominate low-wage, precarious work. One in three women earn less than $15 per hour compared to one in five men. We call on the government to address the barriers in accessing leave such as maternity and parental leave. Research shows that Quebec's maternity and parental leave does a much better job at reaching low-income families than does the program available in the rest of Canada. There are several elements behind this, including a lower entrance requirement, additional “use it or lose it” weeks of leave for the non-birthing parent, and higher replacement rates for portions of the benefit period. UFCW Canada members have many diverse social and economic concerns. The following additional recommendations are based on issues that are particularly relevant to them.UFCW Canada recommends that legislation be amended to compel employers to provide reliable scheduling practices and better notice periods. The majority of retail workers are women working part-time hours. Employers do not always give guarantees as to how many hours a part-time employee will receive. This results in insufficient notice of shifts, last-minute changes to schedules, cancelled shifts right before they begin, and abbreviated shifts once the employee has arrived. This gives employers a large pool of individuals willing to work at a moment's notice, as this is the only way they can get their hours. Unreliable scheduling practices operate to the detriment of many workers, particularly part-time employees. These practices disproportionately affect women and worsen the wage gap. UFCW Canada local 1006A and locals 175 and 633 recently negotiated scheduling languages with a large food retailer aimed at addressing the notice issue. The two-week rolling schedule provides each employee at least 10 days' notice of what their schedule will be for the week. With the exception of emergencies, without the consent of the affected employees the employer cannot be allowed to change the schedule once posted. Providing adequate notice is important for allowing employees to plan their lives in such a way as to maximize their work hours to their desired level. We also call on the federal government to champion, support, and help fund a high-quality, universal child care system. UFCW Canada recently surveyed its young members, of which more than 60% are women, on what they would like to see from the federal government when it comes to addressing young worker issues. Access to high-quality, universal child care ranked as one of their top three responses in the survey. Women are unable to access better-paying jobs or full-time jobs because of the lack of affordable and accessible child care in this country. Working mothers in Quebec have been able to benefit tremendously from the implementation of high-quality, universal child care, and this is widely accepted as a key component of reducing the gender wage gap.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t We understand that negotiations towards a new framework for early learning and child care are under way. We recommend that the federal government, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, make adequate funding available to ensure that all Canadian families can access quality, affordable child care, and that this universal system be considered a priority to be achieved without undue delay.On behalf of the membership of UFCW Canada, we urge the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women to consider all of the above to ensure that the economic security of women is improved in Canada. We look forward to working with all of you.Thank you."}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.

It's not always easy.If the minimum wage is increased to $15 an hour, the consequence is that a number of people within our company and others would be looking at....

In an immediate sense, it might be difficult to adjust, but in the long term, having more disposable income, especially for people with lower incomes—they are the ones who spend that money, and they spend it on consumer goods—the ultimate economic benefit for everybody is positive in a net sense."}, {"turn": 20, "speakerID": "230661", "name": "Ms. Debora De Angelis", "contribution": "In my role as director in Ontario, we receive calls daily, especially from women trying to improve their working conditions by wanting to join a union.

Some of them here in Ontario are caused by government with high hydro prices. What's the logic in saying if we up the minimum wage to $15, we will somehow allow those jobs to continue coming, because already automation is taking over those jobs, filled mostly by women?

The special committee on pay equity had a whole conversation around value. If you look at jobs that women are particularly in, you see it's because, for whatever reason, there's systemic discrimination and they've been considered undervalued. Those are primarily the people in our society for whom we're trying to lift up the minimum wage so that their work is given value.I was a retail worker for six years. I was paid minimum wage. When I asked for a wage increase, they told me, “No. You got your wage increase when the government increased the minimum wage.” I did managers' jobs, shift work, key holder work, and everything else, but I was paid minimum wage. To say that my value was minimum wage is unfair, because I brought way more to the company than my minimum wage job."}, {"turn": 51, "speakerID": "217630", "name": "Mr. Jamie Schmale", "contribution": "Sure.The laws of supply and demand don't change just because you dictate the value of something. The true value of the wage is how the market will take it, with supply and demand. To raise the value of labour it's based, usually, on scarcity. When the economy is chugging along and people are hard to find, the value of the labour goes up. What you're doing is putting a cap on what employers should do and pay. I believe everyone deserves a fair wage—don't get me wrong. I'm just saying you see what's happening now in the industry. Raising the minimum wage will put more of those people who we are all trying to help out of work, because it's happening right now."}, {"turn": 52, "speakerID": "230661", "name": "Ms. Debora De Angelis", "contribution": "We've also seen situations in other places in the world, in Europe particularly, where they pay much higher than a minimum wage and their economies are still moving.Did you want to comment?"}, {"turn": 53, "speakerID": "230662", "name": "Ms. Meg Gingrich", "contribution": "It's what I was saying before to Ms. Ludwig's question. There are numerous studies that show that's simply not true. This idea that the market just dictates everything as if there's no interference as it stands, or that the values that exist right now in people's wages are absent or separate from all sorts of other historical discrimination and assumptions about what types of work are more valuable than others, is simply untrue. That's why we call for things like pay equity legislation as well, and job evaluation where you can actually see that women, in particular, are not paid an equal wage for work of equal value.I don't really agree with that fully. I think from an economic standpoint in places that have higher base wages or collectively bargained wages that are higher, in northern Europe and places like that, or even in the States where they've started implementing some of these $15 minimum wages, you don't see these mass layoffs or this replacement with automation."}, {"turn": 54, "speakerID": "217630", "name": "Mr. Jamie Schmale", "contribution": "Yes, you do.

We are going to get lots of material from your testimony already. I will try to ask three questions in my seven minutes.The first, I think, is for the steelworkers more than anything. I want to say thank you for your union's work on leave provisions for victims of domestic violence. You've been able to negotiate that into a couple of contracts, and it's starting to affect provincial legislation—up to four weeks of paid leave for domestic violence, and up to five months of unpaid leave, although I understand that, on average, women are only taking something like three days to get their lives back in order. In any case, they don't need to lose their jobs because they have been victims of domestic violence at home.We've been hearing at this panel that the cost to the Canadian economy is tremendous, $12 billion. Given that, I was disappointed that the federal budget two weeks ago included spending only within the federal government—$20 million a year, as opposed to the $500 million to fund a domestic violence national action plan that NGOs were asking for.Can you talk a little about how the government could take the leadership to make it a standard that women experiencing violence can take the time they need to get to safety and rebuild their lives?"}, {"turn": 58, "speakerID": "230662", "name": "Ms. Meg Gingrich", "contribution": "Manitoba, I believe, has passed legislation that provides for protected leave. The federal government could do something similar to create some sort of domestic violence leave that's protected for a certain number of days or even weeks, with some income replacement. I think it's as simple as passing legislation—not that this is always easy—that provides leave for domestic violence similar to other types of leave that we have for compassionate care or whatever it may be.We already have a system of leaves, which we argue needs to be improved, but it can fall within that and they can really take a leadership role on that. We've been pushing for it through collective bargaining, as you said, but we want it to be universal for all women and all victims of domestic violence, regardless of whether they are in a union."}, {"turn": 59, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "Great. Thank you.This is for any of the three witnesses. I want to talk a little about Bill C-27. This is a bill that is now in Parliament for debate, and it modifies pension benefits. We are concerned that it threatens the defined benefit plans that women in particular rely on. We've already heard witnesses at this committee say that they are concerned about Bill C-27. Jennifer Howard, from the Public Service Alliance of Canada, said, “If we have seen a decrease in poverty among senior women, good pensions is one of the biggest causes of it”.I see that the steelworkers at least, and maybe UFCW as well, has written to Minister Morneau asking for Bill C-27 to be withdrawn and for defined benefits to be protected.I am interested to know whether you have received an answer to that letter. Also, can you talk a bit more about why eliminating defined benefits is so harmful for women, especially elderly women without other sources of income?"}, {"turn": 60, "speakerID": "230662", "name": "Ms. Meg Gingrich", "contribution": "Defined benefits are always, as we say, the gold standard of pension plans. They are extremely important for maintaining economic security. Historically, especially when they were excluded from paid labour at the same level as men, women were often not covered by pension plans of any type, including CPP or any type of workplace plan. OAS and GIS have been extremely instrumental in reducing seniors' poverty, particularly for single women.The Canadian pension system is designed in a way that it has to be supplemented by private plans, whether that third pillar is through your private savings or a workplace plan. We see that through private savings people simply cannot put enough money away to save as much as they will need in retirement through RRSPs, TFSAs, or whatever mechanism it may be. People's wages are stagnating, debt is increasing, and people simply cannot save as much money as they're told they are supposed to.Defined benefit plans are the best way to supplement the public pension system. They should not be at the expense of the public pension system or anything like that, but having that defined, reliable income in retirement that the employer is required to fund properly—they have solvency funding requirements and things like that, which ensure they're actually funding their pension plans—is something that we need to maintain to make sure that people have a reliable income in retirement and that it can't simply be changed at any time. The strict funding rules that go along with having defined benefit plans ensure, to some extent at least, that those will actually be funded, and they are funded collectively in a way that private plans are not."}, {"turn": 61, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "Thanks.Is there anything that other witnesses want to add on that?"}, {"turn": 62, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "May I speak, please?"}, {"turn": 63, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Yes."}, {"turn": 64, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "Thank you.There is a problem. Every time I want to speak, I am not able to do so, because I do not have access to the mic. So I am quite unhappy.Regarding defined benefits, I support what was just said. On the question of pension plans, I want to point out that women, overall, are much poorer than men, because they have lower wages and they have less capacity to save money than men. There are still too few private pension plans. More women than men retire before age 65 because of family obligations, the jobs they hold, and their difficult working conditions. In addition, their life expectancy is much longer. As a result, they need a public pension plan, to be able to count on an acceptable income.Public pension plans are the only ones that, at least partially, take into account women's unpaid work in their families, whether with children or family members who have lost autonomy or are sick, and so they help to advance equality between men and women. In our opinion, it is important that the public plans stay in place and that they be enhanced. When it comes to the entire question of defined benefits, it is important to preserve them, because, otherwise, women will be increasingly impoverished. They have so much trouble saving money, given the wages they earn. They will be doubly penalized. That is what I wanted to say.Since I have the floor, I want to tell you that I would have had a lot of things to say on the subject of work schedules and work-family balance. In Quebec, we have done studies with the universities and workplaces on this subject, and I would have liked to talk to you more about that. I would also have liked to talk to you about linkages with child care services, but I was unable to speak. The system is not working. That is what I wanted to say."}, {"turn": 65, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.

Your union was part of the union delegation that participated in the session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women held in March 2017. In fact, I had the pleasure of being part of that delegation, as were many of my colleagues here today. We also had the privilege of having the minister, Ms. Thériault, with us. The delegation asked the government to take measures on several issues, including access to suitable jobs for all women, to workplaces organized around families, to child care services, and to care for the elderly.Ms. Gingras, can you describe for us what you mean by suitable jobs for all women? In your opinion, what is a workplace organized around families, child care and care for the elderly?"}, {"turn": 69, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "I do not know whether I understand your second question properly. I am going to begin by answering the first one about suitable jobs.Having a suitable job means having a job that offers acceptable working conditions and an acceptable wage. Just now, we were talking about the connections with the minimum wage. On that point, there are a great many working women and men who are still earning minimum wage.This gives me the chance to say that in Quebec, we have experience with workplaces that, in 2016 and 2017, tried to negotiate, with unions, working conditions and wages above $15 an hour, in retirement homes, in particular. We were able to do that. Employers have shown themselves to be sensitive to that. There are beneficial effects because the employees are much more satisfied. It also allows for better relationships to be established when it comes to labour relations and employee retention.Coming back to the subject of suitable jobs, we are talking about good working conditions. We are talking about working conditions that enable women to be comfortable in the work they do, whether in terms of schedules or work-family balance. We also have to enable these women to have access to leave not only when a child is born, but also when parents or family members are sick. We have to make a connection with labour standards, with the Quebec parental insurance plan, and with child care services. I talked about that a little. As I was saying earlier, that is important, because having good child care services that are educational and accessible enables women to keep working and to have access to employment. There is also the entire question of pension plans. That is connected with acceptable work too. Having an acceptable job includes being able to count on an acceptable pension when you get on in years. That is important, and it is also important to provide women with adequate incomes. I could mention several other elements.Could you remind me of the second question, please?"}, {"turn": 70, "speakerID": "215906", "name": "Mrs. Eva Nassif", "contribution": "Yes.In your experience, would access to workplaces that are organized around the family increase women's economic security. If so, why?"}, {"turn": 71, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "That is clear. It ties in with what I was just saying.Good services enable women to go to work with peace of mind, because the children are being cared for. They are not just being placed in day care. The service is of high quality, and there are trained specialized educators working there. Once those services are offered, it enables women to go to work with their minds at rest, to count on safe services, and have the means to obtain them. We are talking about universal access: it means that women, and also men, can count on these services and have the means to do that.I said this in my presentation. The evidence can be seen in Quebec. From the time when educational child care services were created, women's labour market participation rate rose significantly, particularly for women with young children. When we compare the situation with the situation elsewhere in Canada, there is a gap between the two, and the situation is much better in Quebec than in the rest of Canada. There are studies that prove this.It is also very beneficial for the children. The positive effects of these services have been documented; for example, they give children from disadvantaged backgrounds equal access. That enables them to socialize and to prepare for kindergarten, and so on. There is no doubt about this: these are important services. I know that the Quebec example is cited in Canadian discussions, and there is good reason for that. The system in Quebec has proven itself, and that matters.Everything is not perfect in Quebec. Budget cuts have done harm in recent years. Early childhood centres have suffered cuts. Child care services have closed their doors. There is also the entire question of the subsidies that have to be allocated so the network can be expanded, because different services are offered. There are subsidized services and other services that are not subsidized. Nonetheless, we have a system that is worthwhile and beneficial. There is no doubt about that."}, {"turn": 72, "speakerID": "215906", "name": "Mrs. Eva Nassif", "contribution": "I think you spoke earlier about the fact that unionization influences women's economic prosperity.

It enables them to do that, there is no doubt about it.The statistics tell the story.

You're talking about women and day care. I want to look at it in the big scope and the big picture of families and day care. We have to recognize one of the things we need, and even this budget showed extended parental leave, though we know the uptake for parental leave is only about 2% of men. What can we do so that we have more of a family balance, rather than it all being on the mother's shoulders? I think we heard a lot about what women need, but men also need support. I recognize, working full time here, that I do have a spouse who takes on all the family responsibilities. What are we doing to make sure that we empower men as part of the family unit, not just as breadwinners?"}, {"turn": 77, "speakerID": "230615", "name": "Ms. Carole Gingras", "contribution": "Yes. I would say that, in Quebec, the creation of paternity leave has made a difference when it comes to the parental insurance plan.The paternity leave provisions mean that a father is entitled to take five or three weeks at home, depending on the individual's base plan. If he does not do that, those weeks are not transferable. As a result, we have seen fathers using that leave. That's related to the figure I was telling you about. Significant growth has been noted among fathers. When the parental insurance plan came under the federal employment insurance plan, 26% of Quebec fathers used parental leave; under the present Quebec plan, it is 83%.We have seen a difference. It is not just that they are taking leave. We are also seeing models emerging, fathers caring for children. Because parental leave, after paternity leave, can be split between the men and the women, we are seeing a difference there, too. More and more fathers are taking a portion of the parental leave and making a difference by being there with their children."}, {"turn": 78, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "That's fine.

There are all sorts of economic problems that arise out of low wages, beyond the idea that the value of labour is purely determined by the market. I guess indigenous women just deserve to make significantly less than white men, and it's just the market dictating that. No, I'm sorry, that's not true. There are all sorts of other factors that go into it.I would say to small business owners who are worried that we have to look at a larger economic picture, which might not always allay all their fears, and I would say that you get more economic demand when people make more money, when they have higher wages.

I've worked with marginalized women who have been in a shelter or who have gone to a women's centre, and I've worked with teen moms. Most recently I've been working with women entrepreneurs. I have to say, that's the most positive piece of what I've been doing.What I'd like to do is walk through some of the things I've observed over the years. Unfortunately, things haven't changed much. I have to start with affordable child care. I'm sure you've been hearing this all the time, but really, if women cannot afford to have child care, they can't work, and there goes their social and economic security.I was talking to someone from Toronto. I think it is harder in bigger cities. It's really a bit like the housing market, in that she put her name down as soon as she was pregnant to get a child care spot. When she got one, it wasn't anywhere near where she was working or where she was living. She had to put down her first and last month's deposit, which is just like the case with accommodation. When she got there she found that her little guy couldn't tolerate being with a lot of people and was getting sick all the time, so she had to pull him out. Then she thought she'd go the nanny route. Nannies charge $50 an hour. Here she was with a middle management position, and she said, “I couldn't afford it; I did the math and I could not afford to work.” We are losing out on so many women being part of the labour market because they can't afford “affordable child care”. This is someone with one child. If you have more than one child, it's even worse. When you start doing the math, paying for each child is just impossible. If you work shift work or you work different times or work part time, it is extremely difficult.I really think this is one of the major issues that the federal government has to look at: having affordable child care. I'm not saying free—actually, free doesn't work; it's just taken advantage of. I certainly think that if there are more subsidized spots available, and some creativity.... There's a lot happening in Scandinavia.For example, there is someone who runs Kids and Company, which is a privately owned business. It might be good to start looking at a private partnership with somebody like that, because she offers emergency child care so if your child is sick you can take your child there. She's in the workplace. I really encourage you to talk to Victoria Sopik, who owns that business, to see whether there's some way you could learn from it and also build something that would make it easier for women to work.The other challenge is that, as we all know, most of the time there needs to be two people working in a family to make ends meet. Unfortunately, what parents sometimes do is go the informal child care route; they go with the unlicensed child care providers. There's been a lot in the news this week about the horrific case in Vaughan in which a child died. There were 35 children in that home and 12 dogs. That really cannot be tolerated. I think that as a country we have to look at what standards we're setting for informal child care. If they're licensed, they're part of a federal or a provincial government ruling, but perhaps we need to up the standards and also set in place some regulations to make sure that something like that never happens again.I'm going to move on to marginalized women. I used to be the president of Halton Women's Place. When I was there we found that half the women never made it to the shelter. We were concerned, because we knew there was abuse happening. We thus started up a women's centre located in a mall on the second floor. It was really easy, because the women could say they were going shopping and then come upstairs to visit with us. Much of what we did was support them in what they were going through and help build their self-esteem, but it became very clear to me that while that's fine, they needed to find a job. They needed to be able to find work so that they could put their best foot forward and move forward with their lives and for their children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t We actually started doing job search skills and we started to work on how they could find a job. For some of them they didn't even know what they wanted to do. It was, you know, what do you want to be when you grow up? They hadn't really thought about what their skill sets were. I would really like to see more programs like that, more programs where we're helping women at the grassroots level move forward with their lives.The other group of people who I have worked with were teen moms. I had 65 students who we were helping to get through high school—and they did. But one thing we did was make the curriculum practical. For example, they did their income tax as part of their math program. I know there are moves to make more practical life skills part of the high school curriculum, and I really think that is a great idea.The Chair: Ms. Anne Day: Oh, I haven't even got to women entrepreneurs. That was quick. In that case I'm moving right along.I'm glad that the government has chosen to fund Futurpreneur. I have a suggestion: broaden it to women over 40, or people over 40. We are seeing more and more women and men, I guess, starting businesses, and there are no programs for them. They are only for those who are under 39. My other suggestion, cutting to the quick, is that every province has a women's enterprise centre funded by the federal government, except Ontario. We are one of the biggest business hubs and it seems somewhat odd that there isn't a women's enterprise centre that is funded here in Ontario. There are different groups of us working independently and it would be really good if you brought us all together.Thank you."}, {"turn": 112, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Wonderful.We'll now go to Linda for seven minutes."}, {"turn": 113, "speakerID": "230729", "name": "Ms. Linda Davis (First Vice-President, Canadian Federation of Business and Professional Women)", "contribution": "Thank you. Good morning.In the interests of time and with all protocol observed, I'd like to thank the committee for the opportunity to address the topic of women's economic empowerment. I have been a member of the business and professional women's organization for more than 20 years. I served as the provincial president for Ontario from 2012 to 2014, and as mentioned, I am currently the first vice-president for BPW Canada. From April 2015 to May 2016, I was appointed by an order in council to the Ontario minister of labour's steering committee tasked with studying the causes of and recommending ways to close Ontario's gender wage gap. I recently attended the CSW 61 meeting at the UN and was a delegate for BPW International. It's these experiences that I draw on today for my comments.I will start by saying that the imbalance of power between men and women is not a women's issue. This is a societal issue based in human rights. Although those of us who have been working in this for some time understand that, the general public does not, and that was borne out in the consultation process. Most young women don't know that there's inequality in the workplace and usually don't come to that realization until mid-career. We desperately need a national awareness campaign before any real change can happen. We must ensure that, during the awareness process, we do not create a women versus men attitude, and that again was borne out in the consultation process.This issue is a societal issue, as already noted, and it will take men and women working together to eliminate the bias and the inequality. Men have had privilege in our society since the beginning of recorded time. We cannot risk dividing our society and creating a Donald Trump phenomenon here in Canada. The intent must be clear that men are asked to share the responsibilities of family, to create welcoming work environments, and to open themselves to change.Women also must bear the burden of sharing their domain, and work with men to create this change. Employers must change their attitudes to accept men as parents and allow the flexibility for them to meet their family responsibilities. In the past, that meant bringing home a good paycheque. Today, that means sharing the care, sharing the work, sharing the decision-making, and sharing the rewards. Once the public is aware of the issue, the causes, and the solutions, legislative changes will be more easily adopted and implemented.Key areas for change are, of course, child care, which has been already mentioned, employment insurance leaves, education, and pay equity legislation, and that's just to name a few. We need a high-quality affordable, accessible, publicly funded, and geared-to-income child care system with sufficient spaces to meet the needs of Canadians. We also need a better system for elder care. However, assistance to the family care alone will not solve the problem. This must be accompanied with changes to the employment insurance system. We need a “use it or lose it” father care leave to encourage men to share the care. Both parents must have access to some kind of top-up. Studies show that men are more likely to take those leaves when they have sufficient benefits. The top-up could be an optional opt-in program to deduct higher premiums, or a separate government-supported savings plan like the educational savings plan.Flexible EI leave plans must also allow both parents to move in and out of the workplace for predetermined periods of time to accommodate their career activities and their advancements while offering continuous care to the child. This flexible leave should continue beyond the parental leave to accommodate short time-off leaves for sick children so parents can be compensated if they're even only off for a day, and that's if they don't have paid sick days from work. Our educational system—and I know this is not necessarily specifically to the federal government—must strive for a bias-free curriculum and delivery, and we heard information at the consultations that delivery is not bias-free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t I believe that gender balance in the classroom plays a big role and must be involved in all aspects of organized classroom activities, whether it's during playtime or whether it's shared experience. As boys and girls learn from each other and share their knowledge and their experience, we will see less segregation into stereotypical roles as they progress through school.Pay equity legislation should include gender-based analysis of workplaces and reporting of that analysis. Workplace education, transparency of wages, reporting of workplace data, policies, and strategies to government related to gender equality are a must. Some of the reporting could be incorporated into employment tax data already gathered by Revenue Canada. Data is another topic that requires that we ensure we are collecting data so we can show progress. We have found that many employment programs and different programs that were happening were actually gathering data, but the data was not being gathered by gender. When we asked why they didn't have that data by gender, they said they'd never been asked for it. Simply rearranging the programs that are happening, asking for data to be gathered by gender, by race, and by religion, could very much help the lack of data we have in this situation.Thank you for the opportunity.

PARO Centre for Women's Enterprise, in Thunder Bay, does that right now. I think supporting those sorts of ventures is the way to go. I sat on the task force for small business looking at why women's businesses didn't grow. We did it across Canada and we came up with three reasons. One reason was lack of financial literacy. The second reason was not using IT the best they could to move their businesses forward. The third reason was lack of confidence. That was huge. Lack of confidence is really big. I've spent the last three years working on a book called Good Enough, which looks at why women don't feel good enough, and the confidence level is really there. They question everything. They're full of self-doubt. Building programs and services that work on the inner person before they can move forward with their business is helpful, as well as financial skills."}, {"turn": 125, "speakerID": "219058", "name": "Ms. Pam Damoff", "contribution": "Thank you.I'm going to share my time with Ms. Ludwig."}, {"turn": 126, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Go ahead."}, {"turn": 127, "speakerID": "215907", "name": "Ms. Karen Ludwig", "contribution": "Thank you.Thank you both for your presentations this morning.My questions are regarding women or diversity on boards.

Linda, I want to start with you.We talk about curriculum a lot. In my own constituency, the STEAM Centre—which is STEM plus the arts—of the Thames Valley District School Board in our area is focusing on a program and doing a pilot for the program starting in September 2017. You talked about grassroots. I believe much of our problem is that we're not getting it as the children grow. Even when I was in public school in the early eighties, you would go in, you would go to the workshop and you would cook, and all the girls and boys did this together. Those kinds of programs were taken away. Personally, I would probably never have gone into a workshop if it hadn't been for the school, and now we don't see those sorts of things. I find that the curriculum sometimes.... Trust me, I love our counsellors and guidance counsellors in the high schools, but often they are not affiliated with the actual workforce. They're affiliated with school boards and therefore may not know the opportunities.How can we work better with our secondary schools and our elementary schools so that we're starting this early? We talk about the competence. I think if you were to put me in a workshop.... I was in a workshop in grade 7. I was terrible, but I still at least tried. There are other people, though, who are going to be successful. We see lots of changes in the automotive sector. What can we do, starting with those children in grades 7 and 8, so that as they're growing they're not feeling excluded from certain fields? How can we work on that?"}, {"turn": 140, "speakerID": "230729", "name": "Ms. Linda Davis", "contribution": "I'm glad you asked that, Karen. Thank you.I think a really key piece here is to make sure that the learning is experimental. There's a great way, I think, that school boards can do this through partnering with business. I think partnering is wonderful. It shares a bit of the cost and it shares the responsibility, but it makes an awareness piece for the employers too.On the steering committee we talked about having field trips going out to different types of employers, making sure that students see women in what we're going to call non-traditional—I've had my fingers slapped about calling it non-traditional.... I think we should change the language there. Let me say, making sure that young men and boys see themselves or see their counterparts in something that might be more female-dominated.Another economical way we can do this is to partner with those employers, but instead of making field trips, which are costly and time-consuming, create videos and make sure that the videos are a bit contrived, in the sense that we're giving the message we want to give, so that we show the best light for the industry and the best welcoming environment for either gender to be engaged in it. We also need to make sure we're engaging students at a young age, so that they see the possibility of what that industry is about first-hand, in a real-life experience kind of situation."}, {"turn": 141, "speakerID": "217605", "name": "Mrs. Karen Vecchio", "contribution": "That's awesome.

I always say that for every dollar, it's $1.30 minimum that somebody is actually putting out when they're paying to have an employee.

I think it's a question of the exposure and also of working with the parents, because there's still a stigma about working in the skilled trades. I think it's important to reach the parents so that they encourage their children.I recently was in Linamar, which is a company in the automotive industry in Guelph.

The parental leave changes announced in the budget two weeks ago seemed like a good thing, but it looks as though they lead to a penalty for women. With the new changes, a woman can take 12 weeks before her due date as well as up to 18 months of parental leave with her child. The problem, however, is that women would need to take time out from the workplace, because the government didn't include the dropout clause with the Canada pension plan calculation for new mothers, the expansion of CPP. That means that there's a CPP penalty for women who use the full time allocated to them for maternal leave. It ends up, in effect, being rather clawed back. At the elderly time of their life, they are again going to have that compounded problem of not having the benefit of all that time in the workplace.We heard from Professor Kathleen Lahey back in February at this committee. She said that the government should have included a provision for women who take time out to care for children and that it wouldn't have been an expensive or difficult change to the expanded CPP.

Thank you, Linda Davis, for your work.Your organization has noted that women are under-represented in fields such as skilled trades and science, technology, engineering, and math. Given this, I'm concerned that the federal government's spending on infrastructure—as in the focus just in last month's budget—looks as though it may leave women out of the equation so far as infrastructure spending is concerned. We heard earlier in this study from Professor Marjorie Cohen about the Vancouver Island highway construction in the nineties, which used equity hiring to promote the participation of both indigenous people and women in the highway construction. As a result of inserting that provision into the tenders, they went from 2% of women at the beginning of the project to having women and indigenous people constitute 20% of the labour force on this major highway construction on Vancouver Island.Do you support initiatives like that to increase women's participation in—I wanted to say “non-traditional sectors”, but I know you're saying I shouldn't say “non-traditional”—STEM and infrastructure projects?"}, {"turn": 155, "speakerID": "230729", "name": "Ms. Linda Davis", "contribution": "Absolutely. I think that we as a society have to start thinking about the spending. Government spends a lot of money. They are a driving force in our economy. Without their considering the gender impact to that spending, we can find a lot of expansion of the gender wage gap by virtue of that kind of not thinking ahead. I applaud, then, that kind of initiative. We have to have infrastructure spending. How do we balance it? Do we also balance it by spending in the health care and human services at the same time? Do we split the spending dollar so that we're making sure we're balancing it, or do we try to balance the spending by means of initiatives such as you've mentioned?I certainly would support that kind of thinking."}, {"turn": 156, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "Thank you.I'd like to also talk about your brief to the Canadian government.

We've been hearing from witnesses already that elderly women are often the most economically vulnerable women in Canada. I'm hoping you can reiterate some of the parts of your brief, or just let the committee know your advice, on what the government can do to make sure that older women in Canada do not live in poverty.

My first question is for Ms. Day. You have 38 years of experience. Thank you so much for all you've done. What I want to follow up on a bit is what Ms. Malcolmson mentioned concerning a national seniors strategy. I've submitted a bill, we're going to be voting on the bill, and I hope everyone will be supporting the creation of a national seniors strategy in May. I've been talking to the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, and long-term care associations. Part of the strategy they've outlined as a priority is concerned with compassionate care and caregiving and a lot of the unpaid work involved.

They have teenagers, they may be going through a messy divorce, and they also have senior parents. It's a question of having time to deal with those situations. It's almost as though it could push them over the edge, because it's very difficult. Having some supports, either paid time off work, or in the case of entrepreneurs, maybe there's a benefit they could get.... Trying to work the maze of all the different services that are available and all the different criteria involves extremely difficult navigation, so I think that even having a plan—whereby you could see that if your partner has X or your mother has this, then here is where you would go for help—would help. It's very difficult to navigate and it's time-consuming at a stressful time."}, {"turn": 166, "speakerID": "224981", "name": "Mr. Marc Serré", "contribution": "Thank you.Ms. Davis, you indicated in your presentation the lack of data.

When we were gathering our data we had to jump among different forms of data, which aren't always comparable. I applaud the census' being established again. We need that information and data. We have to have employer data. I know that we're looking at a pay equity act nationally. That act really should involve the gathering of data. There should be a requirement within that process that employment and wage data be gathered and shared. Even though I know that the information is already being gathered.... We talked about this as well, that Revenue Canada gathers much of that employment and wage data, but it's not necessarily shared, or there's no access to it. To be able to use it in a meaningful way, we have to have that. I would say that an easy fix whenever programs and projects are funded would be that there be a data-gathering component to them."}, {"turn": 168, "speakerID": "224981", "name": "Mr. Marc Serré", "contribution": "Thank you.

Even prior to being an MP, I sponsored many of the business awards, luncheons, and suppers. Continue the good work that you're doing. What I wanted to ask is this. You mentioned also in your presentation the need for a national awareness campaign. We heard about this from other witnesses. Do you have any examples or suggested partners, or can you expand a bit on the idea? How can we look at implementing it? It would be large as a campaign, but do you have a specific area that you would recommend it focus on?"}, {"turn": 169, "speakerID": "230729", "name": "Ms. Linda Davis", "contribution": "The Ontario government ran a campaign for “It's never okay”, for gender violence. It was really hard-hitting, I think, and very effective. They showed a scene happening that people, I'm sure, will have seen every day. We've normalized these kinds of things, and no one says anything, a young man taking a drunk young woman out of a party, as an example, and looking to the camera to say, “Thanks for not saying anything.” Then they show the repercussion of that, or the situation when somebody does say something, and the young woman leaving the party saying, “Thanks for saying something.” I think there's a great example there of showing the situation, in a campaign that I think was very effective. Echoing something along those lines would be very helpful."}, {"turn": 170, "speakerID": "224981", "name": "Mr. Marc Serré", "contribution": "Thank you.I want to ask, Ms. Day, about the lack of a woman's centre in Ontario for entrepreneurs.

Do you, however, have any specific recommendations for the future entrepreneurial.... You mentioned the “over 40”, which is a good example. Do you have any other recommendations?"}, {"turn": 171, "speakerID": "230691", "name": "Ms. Anne Day", "contribution": "I actually used to volunteer for them, so I'm familiar with their program. I think the key is that not only do the young people get a grant, but they get a mentor for two years. That's actually what the government needs, I think, because—let's face it—this is taxpayers' money. If you are giving money to futurpreneurs, you want to make sure it's being well spent, especially given the failure rate of new businesses. Extending it to those over 40 makes sense to me. We are seeing many women being downsized or ending up in divorce. What do they do? They may stay at home the whole time and not have any skill sets, so they start looking at what they could do. Broadening it with futurpreneurs.... You already have a base there, a program that runs and runs well, so what would be the difference in extending the age? Plus, if you're over 40, one hopes you have some experience and some skills that would make your business more successful."}, {"turn": 172, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "That brings us to the end of our time to hear witnesses today. We have a little bit of committee business to take care of. I want to thank our witnesses. You are both a wealth of information. Thank you for the work you do. I would invite you, if you have any other comments that you think would be helpful to the committee, to feel free to send those to the clerk. We appreciate them. In terms of the business we have as a committee, you will have received the eighth report of the subcommittee. It basically considered the work we're going to do on Bill C-337 and said that there's a budget of $9,000 for it. There is a press release that we were going to send out to ask for briefs on it. There was a decision by the subcommittee that we want to include all of the testimony we heard on violence against women and girls. Because there was a lot of overlap and a lot of testimony that pertained to the judicial training, we want to make sure it's included in the study so that we don't have to recall all those witnesses, in an attempt to narrow a bit. The subcommittee also decided that we should set aside two days, April 11 and April 13, for all of the witnesses we've agreed upon—and there is a work plan for you to review—and that we would then undertake clause-by-clause on May 4. That was the first part. The second part had to do with the economic security study that we're now doing. We wanted to reissue the press release to make sure that we can extend and get more briefs. Then we talked about how, as we go along here in this study, we have noticed that questions may come up or there may be witnesses we have not heard from, so we wanted to have an opportunity to put forward some more witnesses to fill in any of the gaps. Originally, we were thinking we would do so today, but I would propose, if the committee is happy to do it, that we allow some time for people to submit those names, because it's not as though we're in a hurry. We're continuing this study into the fall. It would be great if we could get the list of any additional witnesses people want to hear by the end of April.

I think it would be helpful for us to be able to talk with her directly about that. I'll give a copy of this to the clerk.

I'm also seeing that we have seven panels that are dedicated to trade, STEM, and entrepreneurship, but only one meeting devoted to indigenous women, one meeting for women with economic challenges, which includes women with different abilities, and no meetings about young women, elderly women, or immigrant women. I would urge committee members to think about that to get us ready for our deadline at the end of April. I will be proposing paring down some of the seven panels that we have now, and I'll be proposing some other suggestions. For example, there's CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. They've done a lot of analysis. They might be helpful for us to call on. Also, there's B.C.'s Federation of Students.
