My specialization is care work for seniors, both in its paid and unpaid forms, and that's what I'll focus my comments on today. \n              The conversation about unpaid work is current and it's critical. What it isn't, however, is new. The quintessential Canadian book on gender and unpaid work, The Double Ghetto, was written nearly 40 years ago. It used Statistics Canada data to look at women's and men's segregated work inside and outside the home. A recent second printing highlights some of the gains women have made in educational attainment and labour force position. However, it scathingly reveals the persistent segregation all these years later, particularly when we consider care work. \n              The debate is increasingly showing up in popular media. For instance, following on the heels of Anne-Marie Slaughter's Atlantic Monthly piece, Melinda Gates used her 2016 annual letter to focus on unpaid work. She wrote:\n              \n                \n                  Unpaid work is what it says it is: It’s work, not play, and you don’t get any money for doing it.... You can think of unpaid work as falling into three main categories: cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly. Who packs your lunch? Who fishes the sweaty socks out of your gym bag? Who hassles the nursing home to make sure your grandparents are getting what they need?\n                \n              \n              Child care is most often the focus of debates about unpaid work, while care for seniors is less visible. Care work for seniors in both its paid and unpaid forms can involve help with body care, dining assistance, and organizing, such as with medical appointments and finances, providing transport, and assisting with the home, such as cleaning and maintenance. \n              Importantly, family care work and private companion care provided in communal and publicly funded dwellings like nursing homes are less often discussed. My comments will highlight paid and unpaid care work and note when it is publicly funded or privately paid. \n              Care work is gendered, with women generally providing greater quantities and performing tasks that are more time-consuming and less flexible than care work than men provide. For instance, women provide more housekeeping, meal preparation, and personal as well as medical care. Men provide more transport and home maintenance such as snow shovelling. \n              According to a Statistics Canada, in 2012 there were 5.4 million Canadians who provided care work to a senior with a chronic health condition, a disability, or a problem related to aging.\n              The location where care work is provided is also an important consideration. More than two-thirds provided care work to a senior living in a private household. An additional 16% provided that care work to a senior who lived in a private household with them. Another 14% provided care work to a senior who was living in a care facility.\n               It is most often daughters and spouses who provide this work to women who live in residential settings. The 2016 census data show that about 70% of those who live in nursing homes as well as seniors residences are women.\n              Many Canadians are also providing substantial amounts of care work in terms of time. More than half of family or friends who lived with a senior provided more than 10 hours per week of care. Nearly one-quarter are doing more than 10 hours of care per week for a senior living in a nursing home where publicly paid care is available and provided. \n              We also cannot ignore the impact of providing care work. Strain on family relationships was reported by just over one-third of those helping seniors living in a care facility and about one-third of those who shared a home with a senior needing care. This compared with about one-fifth of those who provided care work to seniors living in a separate household and about one-quarter of those who help seniors living in supportive housing. \n              Women also experience greater negative impacts resulting from their care work, affecting areas as wide-ranging as their finances, their health, and their social lives. \n              The care needs of people with dementia are particularly important to consider. There are more than half a million people currently living with dementia in Canada, with estimates that this figure will nearly double by 2031. The unpaid care required to aid people living with dementia is an estimated 19.2 million hours per year. That's unpaid care, and a conservative replacement cost of this is $1.2 billion. Experts warn that care work time is also expected to double in accordance with the numbers of those living with the condition. A very large proportion of the costs of unpaid dementia care work is borne by families because the public system only covers a fraction of the total cost of dementia. \n              More attention is required to attend to the diverse needs of diverse women. For instance, due to cultural challenges, most immigrant families provide care work in private homes, even when dementia is a factor, and they don't, therefore, place families in nursing homes. More attention is also required to look at unmet needs. Families are dispersed geographically. In addition, the family unit has changed over time, with fewer children available to provide care work. \n              \n               According to Statistics Canada, nearly half a million Canadians required care for chronic health conditions but did not receive it. One-quarter of those with unmet needs were over the age of 65.\n              Paid care work is also a key consideration. It is a feminized occupation. Overall, 80% of the paid care workforce is composed of women, and women make up over 85% of paid care workers in nursing homes. There is a large proportion of women from diverse racialized and immigrant populations who provide care work to seniors in communal settings. Immigrant and racialized women are often streamed into this care work, especially when other women are unwilling to do the work.\n              Care work is also among the riskiest of workplaces. Our research shows that care workers in Canada are frequently exposed to high rates of illness, injury, and violence. Conditions in Canada are far worse than in the Nordic countries, for instance. About two-thirds of the nursing and residential workforce is unionized across Canada, but it ranges from a low of 40% in Newfoundland and Labrador to a high of 65.9% in British Columbia. Despite this, most of the work remains low paid, part-time, and lacking in benefits.\n              There is an insufficient amount of publicly funded care available in home care and residential settings. Our research in nursing homes shows that increasing numbers of families are paying out of pocket to hire private companions to provide one-on-one care in nursing homes. This is largely due to insufficient staffing levels afforded by publicly funded care. Importantly, this care work is precarious, often paid under the table, and lacking in employment standards.\n              As the care often completely overlaps with the roles of the care aides who are on staff, it is also risky for the residents, the paid staff, and families. Most facilities lack even basic rules about care work that is paid privately, including about basic but important issues such as ID badges, duties to report to staff, or compliance with vaccination or infection control procedures. This private payment also creates a huge economic burden on families.\n              To conclude, paid and unpaid care work is one of the most important issues affecting the everyday lives of women across this country. While many seniors require care work, an increasing number have needs that are unmet. Paid and unpaid care work comes with risks. Families and friends are bearing an increasing financial and physical burden to provide care. There is an insufficient amount of publicly available care, and this mostly affects seniors who are women. Families are paying privately to compensate for insufficient levels of publicly funded care in nursing homes.\n              Thank you very much for this opportunity to raise these points with you today."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.\n              Now we'll go to Caregivers Nova Scotia.\n              Cindie and Angus, you have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "232339", "name": "Mr. Angus Campbell (Executive Director, Caregivers Nova Scotia)", "contribution": "Madam Chairperson and members of the committee, thank you for accepting our written submission on the impact of caregiving as it relates to women caregivers and for allowing us to make this presentation to the committee.\n              Whether through telephone or face-to-face conversations or in support groups, we are honoured that hundreds of unpaid caregivers have shared their personal stories with us. It is from those stories that our recommendations have been drawn, but perhaps the most important, overarching message we wish to convey is the need to address challenges experienced by caregivers as far upstream in their journey as possible, before they lose their health and their ability to be productive. It is far more efficient to prevent a break than to try to mend an item after it is broken."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "232340", "name": "Ms. Cindie Smith (Caregiver Support Coordinator, Northern and Eastern Mainland Region, Caregivers Nova Scotia)", "contribution": "There are many positive and uplifting testimonials, and we celebrate the caregivers' resilience and achievement. However, the accounts of unmet needs as well as struggles to see the job through and regain one's health at the end are far more common.\n              It is important that we put a human face on these challenges, so we are going to share with you some of their stories.\n              Here is the first one. Pam had to leave work several years before retirement to care for her parents. Although her workplace was able to grant flexibility with her work hours to accommodate medical appointments and the times when she was needed for hands-on care, they declined to do so. Her father and mother died two years apart. Shortly afterwards, her husband was diagnosed with dementia and now needs round-the-clock monitoring. She has lost her most productive pension years. As her husband was self-employed, his only income is CPP and OAS. She has no children, and she is very worried about her financial future."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "232339", "name": "Mr. Angus Campbell", "contribution": "Our second caregiver is Alice, who is a retired nurse living on a pension. She gives care to her elderly mother, who had a brain stem stroke last year. Her mother is no longer able to live independently and has moved in with Alice. Alice's mother was on a feeding tube for some time, and the cost of the food was not covered. Alice reviewed her out-of-pocket expenses for the previous year, and they totalled approximately $16,000. These additional expenses, along with the added stresses of caregiving, have taken a huge toll. Alice was denied the Nova Scotia caregiver benefit because her mother did not have dementia, which is a qualifying factor."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "232340", "name": "Ms. Cindie Smith", "contribution": "Our third caregiver is Cathy. She is 66 years old and one of 10 siblings. She's the only one who didn't marry and have children, so when it came time to care for their 90-year-old mother, it fell to her to move back to Nova Scotia to help. Because Cathy took on that duty, the rest of the family has abandoned their caregiving duties. She does not drive and lives in a rural area, so she must rely on unreliable public transportation to take her mother to a variety of medical appointments. Cathy has recently gone through a cancer diagnosis and treatment, and still, she's the only one who steps up. Now, two years later, she's feeling the stress not only physically but emotionally and financially as well. She struggles every day to do the best for her mom and for herself. She says, if not for her faith and sense of humour, she would be much worse off."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "232339", "name": "Mr. Angus Campbell", "contribution": "Our fourth caregiver is Denise, who was a career nurse and was looking forward to retirement with her husband, but his diagnosis of dementia derailed their plans. She cared for him at home through the journey of this horrible disease until his death. Eighteen months after he died, she went to see her doctor about how terrible she had felt for years. She was no longer willing to chalk it up to caregiver stress or the effects of grief. After some testing, she was diagnosed with her own long-standing chronic medical condition and struggles to retain her mental and physical health."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "232340", "name": "Ms. Cindie Smith", "contribution": "Our final story comes from a wonderfully insightful client, who I have named Flora. She is a reluctant caregiver, and we've had many conversations about the lack of options available to her. Through her frustration, she compares the current condition of caregiving in Canada to the generation of lost young men who served in World War I. Intending no disrespect to their service or sacrifices, she talks passionately about the generation of middle-age women who currently are lost to caregiving.\n              In that discussion, we drew contrasts between the two groups. Soldiers had volunteered or were conscripted, confident that they would receive the tools and skills they needed to be successful. They received a paycheque. It was an indicator of the value of their time and effort and a means of support for their otherwise lost income. They were trained in boot camp on what to expect in the field and how to protect themselves and each other. They were given guns, protective equipment, maps, and rations, and they were shown how to use them. The enemy was defined and could be identified by its uniform. They were taught how the enemy thinks and acts and how to stay a step ahead of it. They were given a platoon leader who would provide guidance and leadership, helping to keep them safe and battle ready. In an office far away, there was a strategist working on a plan of how to defeat the enemy and get the soldiers safely home. When that soldier returned, there were plans and programs and services in place to help him move back into his productive civilian life. \n              By contrast, the average caregiver is more often a conscript than a volunteer for the position and lacks the confidence in what she is undertaking. She receives no paycheque to indicate the value of her time or her lost income. She is not trained for the role, but there are both societal and self-imposed assumptions that she should know or will somehow learn how to do the job. Although reminded often by many well-intended people to take care of herself, she is not versed in the personal dangers of caregiving. \n              Although the enemy is a medical condition, there's often scant information offered to help her understand the characteristics of the illness or what to anticipate. Sometimes there's a secondary enemy disguised as an overburdened health care system, uncooperative family members, or a care recipient who is resistant to services. There's no leader to help her along the way. There are no strategists with an eye to the overall plan and big picture, and when her loved one dies, when she is physically, mentally, and financially broken, there are no services. There is no GI bill to offer transition back to her life, and no glory to come home to, only the sorrow of grief."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "232339", "name": "Mr. Angus Campbell", "contribution": "We thank you for your time."}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good. \n              Now we will go to Hélène Cornellier by teleconference.\n              \n              Ms. Cornellier, you have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "61263", "name": "Mrs. Hélène Cornellier (Coordinator of Action Plan and Communications, Association féminine d'éducation et d'action sociale)", "contribution": "Good morning.\n              I wanted to say that, to stay within the time limits, I will not read the entire four-page brief I submitted. I will skip some paragraphs of the brief to stay within my seven minutes.\n              That was a comment for the interpreters.\n              On behalf of Afeas, the Association féminine d'éducation et d'action sociale, I want to thank the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women for inviting us to participate in the hearings related to its study on the economic security of women in Canada.\n              First, I will give you a brief overview of Afeas, and then I will talk about the two main areas that the government should focus on when implementing solutions to prevent Canadian women from being at an economic disadvantage their entire lives.\n              Afeas is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1966. It represents 8,034 Quebec women who work as volunteers in 225 local groups in 11 regions of Quebec.\n              Since its inception, Afeas has been striving toward gender equality in every sphere of society. That is the organization's main goal, and as a result, it works on various issues affecting women in Quebec and Canada such as: gender equality, including women's ability to access democratic institutions at all levels; the financial security of women throughout their career and after they retire through the recognition of the unpaid work women do within the family as mothers and caregivers; access to education and training, pay equity, non-traditional jobs, and measures to support a work-school-life balance; access to safe living environments and measures to address violence against women and girls.\n              Afeas believes that both the paid and unpaid work of Canadian women must be taken into account in order to ensure their economic security.\n              Since its inception in 1966, Afeas has been considering what impact the lack of recognition for women's work has on our society. In 1968, Afeas presented the information it collected on homemakers to the Bird Commission.\n              One of its first campaigns sought recognition for the contributions women make to family businesses run by their husbands. In 1974, Afeas succeeded.\n              Other campaigns followed, and progress was made toward improving the living conditions of women in Quebec and Canada.\n              Some 35 years later, on April 1, 2001, Afeas created Invisible Work Day. As part of this annual campaign, which is held the first Tuesday in April, Afeas educates the public and decision-makers about the social and economic value of invisible work. Afeas believes that, if the contributions that women make within the family and community—which are essential to our society—were recognized, then social and financial measures could be implemented that would prevent women from living in poverty.\n              On April 1, 2010, at the request of Afeas, MP Nicole Demers moved the motion to make the first Tuesday in April National Unpaid Work Day. Although this motion was adopted, no action has yet been taken to implement it.\n              Here are a few recommendations concerning unpaid or invisible work.\n              First, the Government of Canada should make the first Tuesday in April National Unpaid Work Day, add it to the calendar of national days and acknowledge it every year.\n              Second, Statistics Canada should assess and calculate the value of unpaid work in Canada to show how important it is to the gross domestic product using the 2015 General Social Survey on Time Use. This calculation has not been done for 25 years, since 1992.\n              We also recommend that Statistics Canada make sure that the question regarding household activities is included in the 2021 long-form census, so that the people responding to it would be aware of how much of that type of work they do every day.\n              In addition, we recommend that the federal government ensure that all laws, policies and programs undergo gender-based analysis in order to determine how they will affect women, particularly their economic security.\n              \n              Moreover, we recommend that the Government of Canada adopt a policy on work-life-school balance that applies to all spheres of society, including public institutions and private businesses under federal jurisdiction.\n              Next, we recommend that the Government of Canada work with the provinces and territories to create a family insurance plan that would cover mothers or fathers when a child is born or adopted, as well as caregivers when they have to take time off work to care for a loved one who is sick, has a disability, or is losing his or her autonomy.\n              We also recommend that the federal government work with the provinces and territories to create a national child care program to give women access to affordable child care and allow them to return to the labour market, if they so desire.\n              When it comes to the last two measures, every province and territory must have the option of opting out of this program, under the appropriate agreements, as was the case in Quebec when the Quebec parental insurance plan was implemented in 2006. Similarly, since Quebec has its own child care program, it does not need a national program.\n              We also recommend that the Canadian government provide retirement benefit credits equivalent to 60% of the average industrial wage for the period an individual spent caring for a young child or a loved one, if that person does not have any employment income.\n              Finally, we recommend that the federal government turn non-refundable tax credits for stay-at-home mothers and caregivers into refundable tax credits.\n              I would now like to talk about paid work.\n              There was a major influx of Canadian women into the labour force in the late 1960s. At that time, employers considered these women's contributions to the family as complementary to those of their husbands and, therefore, paid them less.\n              Still today, women generally continue to earn less than men, even for the same work. This lack of pay equity affects many women and has an impact on their economic security throughout their lives. They are negatively affected when they claim benefits, such as maternity, parental or retirement benefits.\n              In its brief, Afeas gives you a few recommendations on paid work."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              We will now go to questions, starting with Mr. Fraser.\n              \n               You have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser (Central Nova, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              I'll begin with our witnesses who are here from back home in Nova Scotia. It's good to see you by video conference.\n              One of the reasons I want to start with you is I'm familiar with the demographic problem, in particular, that Atlantic Canada is facing. We have more seniors per capita out east than any other province or region in Canada. If it hasn't already exploded, there's a ticking time bomb taking place with a need to enhance caregiver services, particularly for our seniors. \n              My grandfather is a 96-year-old veteran who has actually received great in-home care, from which my family has benefited, because of certain programming that we have for veterans. There are many seniors, particularly those living in poverty in my community, who don't have access to a similar level of benefits. \n              Could you comment on how the federal government could best fund in-home care programs for seniors who aren't necessarily veterans to make sure they have access to quality care in their homes as well?"}, {"turn": 15, "speakerID": "232339", "name": "Mr. Angus Campbell", "contribution": "Mr. Fraser, thank you for that question.\n              Right now in Nova Scotia, as you are probably aware, we do have some provincial benefits that are unique to our province. We are the only province that offers a caregiver benefit of $400 a month to low-income people and a supplementary care program of $500 per month for people to look after somebody with dementia. Those things are unique to Nova Scotia. \n              How we can support seniors or caregivers is exactly one thing we have mentioned in our recommendation. We could possibly take a look at the savings to our health care system. We know that people want to stay at home as long as possible, and the health care system is saving from that, so why can we not redirect some of that funding to help keep these people at home?"}, {"turn": 16, "speakerID": "232340", "name": "Ms. Cindie Smith", "contribution": "If I may add, I believe currently there is a guaranteed basic income pilot project going on in three communities in Ontario.

We recognize that everybody has different opinions, and I appreciate that, but when does it become the role of the state versus a member of a family? \n              For me, taking care of my mom is my responsibility. Taking care of my children, whether I put them into child care or whatever it may be, is my responsibility.

We are actually putting greater financial burdens and risks on women and on their futures, because it is particularly women who are taking on these roles. \n              In Denmark, for instance, in a generation, they have made care a shared responsibility between men and women by making both men and women equally responsible and able to enjoy both the benefit and the cost of popping out of the labour force. \n              In addition to that, when we talk about care for seniors, we need to think about the fact that it's not just health care; it's actually social care. The federal government did play a very large role in funding community support services for a very long period of time. These are small grassroots agencies that were providing things like transportation, Meals on Wheels, friendly visiting, and those types of supports, but that support has slowly declined over the course of the past 15 years. In provinces like Ontario there is more and more of an emphasis on these small organizations providing health care services, as opposed to the types of social and emotional supports that they were intended to provide.\n              If we want to live together in Canada as a community, then we need to share some of these responsibilities."}, {"turn": 34, "speakerID": "217605", "name": "Mrs. Karen Vecchio", "contribution": "Tamara, thank you very much.

The nursing home of today is really an alternate for hospital care, so you have people going there who would have been in hospital 15 years ago. We find an increasing medical complexity, people going into nursing homes at the very end of their lives. That's in Canada. That's not necessarily the case in the Nordic countries or the rest of Europe where nursing homes are there to do more social care. \n              When I talk about the care gap, I'm talking about the gap between the care we are able to provide with public funding and how it's filled. It's filled with families in nursing homes, with student work, with the work of volunteers, or we're expecting the paid staff to volunteer their own time so they're working overtime. Also, families are hiring privately paid companions. They're paying out-of-pocket to have private care in publicly funded nursing homes. These care workers are doing work that's identical to that of the paid staff, so it's creating tons and tons of risks for the staff, for residents, and for families. \n              Families are also finding that they are under incredible pressure and burden. Maybe mom has become a bit aggressive with her dementia and the nursing home is saying they can't keep their mom there unless they pay to have someone to watch her around the clock. \n               Families are facing these sorts of burdens and it's an increasing and incredibly difficult challenge and it creates difficulties all the way round.\n              If we think about the role of the federal government, the Romanow commission talked about home care, and they didn't talk about nursing homes at all. Nursing homes are practically invisible. These are extended health services, so as you know, the federal government sends money to the provinces and they don't necessarily look at how much the provinces are funding nursing home care. \n              If the federal government wants to make a big impact, they should be thinking not only about home care, but also about nursing home care. While it is true that people want to remain at home, that's if they have a good home to remain in, and that's if they have sufficient supports to keep them in that home—community supports like Meals on Wheels and transportation, and help with their housing. Some people have no choice but to get round-the-clock nursing care, and they really do need nursing homes. I think by not concentrating on this need, we're neglecting the over 200,000 people who are using these services every year.

They are just being hammered by having invited community calls for support through their seniors connect project. They're funded for 100 places, and they're looking after 400 people who are isolated seniors in poverty with no public transit. Many of these people spent their lives working in low-paid care jobs and are now having a very hard time getting by.\n              I want to focus on the NGO side of things, because the Nanaimo Family Life Association described the hoops they jump through to try to find program funding.

I was just with the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness yesterday asking for additional funds. Our numbers have increased about 15-fold in the last three and a half years. We have well over 4,600 members in our database. We need that operational funding for consistency such that we're able to hold 21 monthly support groups around the province, as well as using some innovation where we're doing it now. We also have a teleconference base for people who do not have access to transportation or have other reasons that they can't attend in-person support groups.\n              We offer some educational workshops on everything from caregiver stress management to safer medications, oral care, and advance care planning. Those are just some that we're offering now, but we have more in the works. We need to have that continuity where I can have the same staff staying in their places doing their jobs. It takes between six months and a year for someone to get up to full speed. The project funding is nice when we are able to get it to do a specific project, but it really is the operational funding that we need. \n              Part of that operational funding, and unfortunately, we don't have it right now—it's one of our recommendations—is to continue to publish hard copies of resources. I can't state that one enough, although many people think it's a simple thing to have a little booklet. There is a 94-page caregiver's handbook that people can sit down with when their caring day may end at about 10 p.m. They can actually sit and read through some of this or keep going back to where it supports them; it helps them get started on things and continue on with their care responsibilities. Personally, I feel that the caregiver's handbook is worth $4 and that we should be funding this.

In addition, there were subquestions on the time spent on housekeeping or directly dedicated to children, persons in need, and so on.\n              In every census, that data allows us to provide an overview of unpaid work. That is not necessarily the most complete overview, as Statistics Canada says, but it does give us an idea of what is happening in Canada. As a result, those who have to fill out the long-form census—20% of the population—can acknowledge the work they do at home for their loved ones.\n              According to Statistics Canada, the best tool would be the General Social Survey on Time Use.

You can imagine, particularly as people age, that their partner may no longer be capable of helping them into a car or getting them out of the house. When we talk about care work, there are a lot of very physical aspects to care work that can't be forgotten. An older person may no longer be capable of driving themselves.\n              There is also an issue with the cost of these programs. While for some people maybe $30 to $40 per day is not prohibitive, for other people it is a lot of money.\n              Finally, there isn't sufficient space, so we are outstripping our capacity in terms of spaces for these day centre programs. This is particularly in communities that are growing rapidly. I think about York region which surrounds York University as one of those areas. This is one strategy that the Alzheimer Society has taken upon themselves. There are other organizations that provide this as well, but again, this is a community support service. This is an area in which the federal government, through their horizons program, was quite keenly involved, but over time that amount of funding has shifted. \n              I think the Nova Scotia organization talked about having operational funding.

Men now see that they have a role to play in care at all stages of life."}, {"turn": 63, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "I can appreciate that, but it certainly does rob people of choice."}, {"turn": 64, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "I'm sorry, Rachael.

FIRST is an acronym that stands for, for inspiration and recognition of science and technology, a family of programs that is a catalyst for learning for students from grades 1 to 12. It's run nationally through school- and community-based teams. There are four FEWO committee members who have a total of 11 teams dispersed among their ridings. Five provinces currently have FIRST high school level teams.\n              The founding mentor of Canada's longest-standing, nationally and internationally most successful girls' team in FIRST, I am a proud supporter of this initiative. Now as chair of the board of FIRST Robotics Canada, and the first woman, I may add, internationally to be in such a role, I am in a national position to impact the ability of girls to chase their dreams in STEM.\n              What's the issue? Here are some of the statistics. Growing numbers of girls successfully pursue post-secondary education in STEM fields. They're very high achievers in university, college, and industry training programs. We tell them that they can do anything and that they know they can. They believe us. When they enter the world of work, though, something causes them to question their choice. Women retreat from these fields as they pursue their careers.\n              Why is there this attrition? They're unsupported by male colleagues. They're frustrated by gender biases, conscious and unconscious, in hiring and promotion practices. They're faced with stigmas related to women in STEM, which is perceived often as being unfeminine. They lack supportive networks. They don't have role models or associations. There is inequity in pay, as reported by Statistics Canada, across all STEM fields. In fact, in Canada, women make 72¢ on the dollar of a same job.\n              We do not see women in leadership—there are 12% of women employed in engineering—or colleagues achieving to their full potential. They're frustrated. They're very high-achieving women, of whom 64% report that they are under more scrutiny than their male colleagues, especially when they're applying for a promotion.\n              The U.S.-based, data-driven and research-driven NCWIT, the National Center for Women and Information Technology, says that women don't need to be fixed; men need to become their allies and advocates.\n              We often hear about the leaky pipeline. Little girls engage in STEM wholeheartedly. I have witnessed this. As they progress along the pipeline, though, they question their ability and lose confidence. Ultimately, without supportive peers and adults, they decide to leave STEM fields. The statistics are clear: those who continue are in a minority in post-secondary programs.\n              Further attrition occurs in the workplace for all of the reasons above. This is a travesty for Canada. It's proven that diversity brings richness of thought, enhanced innovation, stronger teams, and has a profound impact on our GDP.\n              What's the impact of FIRST Robotics Canada? Our recent strategic plan, EDI, equity, diversity, inclusion, is there to support girls or alumnae of the program, but we're in a catch-22. Here we are supporting girls, but we're not serving these extraordinary young women who will be Canada's STEM leaders if we don't focus on the workplaces they will enter.\n              The creation of the Girls in STEM Executive Advisory Council this year is a results-driven, strategy-based group with three aspirational goals: to support young women in FIRST programs; to change the culture of the workplaces into which they will enter; and to investigate the impact of men and dads on the attitudes of their daughters.\n              FIRST's strategy is this, to meet goal one. Last weekend we had our first girls in FIRST weekend. Sixty-five girls from 25 teams across the province and 35 adults came together for two days. The focus was on the development of personal life skills: to be resilient, confident, courageous, brave, embrace failure as a learning opportunity, and to flee from perfectionism—so often part of being a woman—to enable success in the STEM world.\n              \n               On the agenda, we had presentations and panel discussions from role models and industry leaders. If you see her, you can be her. Challenges of the glass obstacle course were discussed. There were workshops to discuss issues, build skills, dream about the future, to network, and to assertively suggest how they would like to proceed. The goal is not to fix the girls, but to augment their skills. Conceived of and executed by adults created the head of the comet, but the girls themselves have taken on the tail. The next steps are emerging.\n              To meet goal two, the girls in STEM executive advisory board are seeking systemic change in workplaces where women traditionally retreat. We are building presentations to build awareness and to call out gender biases and to grow the movement of men as allies and advocates and champions, to clearly state that equity, diversity, and inclusion aren't just good for women, but they're good for society and the economy as well. It is an economic imperative. \n              We need to challenge the media, to change that image of scientists as being men in white lab coats. \n              We intend to call attention to the status quo where 22% of employees in STEM are women, and this has only grown 2% in the past 30 years. We know this will cause discomfort, but we're okay with that.\n              To meet goal three, there are workshops for men in the lives of girls, to make them aware of their impact and provide strategies to support their girls and their daughters. \n              These are aspirational goals of FIRST Robotics Canada to move the needle on the current generation of young women by helping them and by challenging systemic attitudes. If we don't, all the good work encouraging girls in STEM is for naught.\n              What's the national picture? We need women in STEM and for them to stay in STEM. We need to close the gender gap. It isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. That is echoed around the world. We need to achieve systemic support for solutions, to demand change. This will be challenging, but together we can all make it happen. We need national strategies to reverse the trend. It is not just good for society, but for Canada's innovation strategy, the national economy, our place in the world, and it's good for 50% of the population.\n              I have some recommendations. Challenge the status quo by holding CEOs and boards accountable for their demographics and hold organizations accountable for systemic change. Withhold funding and other resources, as Minister Duncan's proposal for university funding states. Bring together organizations that support women in STEM. Build networks. Impose quotas to achieve balance. That's demonstrated by Sweden's voluntary quota project. They can be very effective in boosting diversity and improving systemic change. Engage men in the conversation so that they can become advocates. Empower women, and engage men. There should be support from the federal government to encourage the development of organizations such as Australia's Athena SWAN, the U.K.'s Athena SWAN, and the U.S.-based NCWIT, all of which support women in STEM fields. At present, Canada lags behind in this work, and we need to change that."}, {"turn": 67, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "That's very good.

You have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 68, "speakerID": "232761", "name": "Ms. Iris Meck (President and Founder of Advancing Women In Agriculture Conference, Iris Meck Communications Inc., As an Individual)", "contribution": "Good morning, and thank you to the committee for inviting me to present. \n              I was raised on a farm in Manitoba, took my degree in agriculture and management in agriculture at the University of Manitoba, and have worked in the ag industry for all of my career. \n              In 2000, I started my own company and worked with agriculture communications and marketing, specializing in ag conferences.\n              In 2014, I gathered a group of women leaders from across Canada in the agricultural industry. I brought them together to discuss the opportunities and challenges that women face in the agricultural industry, and the skills and tools that would be needed to hone their leadership skills. \n              It became very apparent through this group of women leaders that there was a strong need for women at every age and every stage of their careers, in every agricultural sector and food sector to hear and learn from the experiences of successful women, to network with women who share a common passion for agriculture and food, and to grow life and career skills to prepare them for the best possible futures. It was an opportunity for women to invest in themselves and benefit their families, their businesses, their communities, and the industry overall. \n              With this as our guiding principle, we created the first Advancing Women in Agriculture Conference in April 2014, and we attracted over 400 women from over six provinces, representing over 130 organizations. It was a huge risk for me, personally, one that was not very profitable but most rewarding. \n              The program emphasizes what I call the key leadership skills and development opportunities that women need in today's society: communication, including mentorship, coaching, and networking; financial management and independence; health, both physical and mental; balancing life strategies and career planning, and setting goals in all of these areas. \n              Speakers were chosen on the basis of their expertise and their experience. They were selected not only from the agricultural industry but from the industry overall. \n              Over the last year, due to demand, we've enhanced the program of agricultural workshops by including networking, succession planning, coaching, financial management, and risk management. \n              The time has never been better, I think, for women in agriculture. Women are changing our industry every day, on the farm, through associations, in our universities, and in the board rooms of corporate agribusiness across North America. \n              To accomplish this change, women need strong networks and solid skills to build confidence, as Dorothy mentioned, to be motivated and inspired, and to increase the recognition of women in the industry through articles, print ads, and their actual day-to-day work. They need real-life, real-world examples of what's possible. That's where Advancing Women takes the lead. \n              Our audience today represents every industry sector, 4-H, university students, farmers, and entrepreneurs. \n              Since 2014, we've held six conferences in Alberta and Ontario. Over 3,000 women—that's an average of 500 women per conference—have attended from across Canada, representing over 350 organizations in Canada. This initiative is clearly filling a great need as represented not only by the number of women who attend but also the importance of the support that we receive from private industry sponsorship. This includes farm organizations, financial institutions, agribusiness, and a wide range of private ag and food stakeholders from across Canada. \n              Many organizations participate not only through sponsorship but by registering many of their staff and customers to attend AWC. They use it as a supplement to their internal training programs and marketing programs. \n              Our main goal for Advancing Women was learning, and bringing an exceptional speaker program to our audience. To date, we've been true to our commitment, and according to our audiences we have exceeded these expectations. \n              Our second goal was to make the conference as affordable as possible for all women in the industry. We are not only grateful to our private industry sponsors, who have helped accomplish this, but also to the Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan governments, which have classified AWC as a training program and allow for reimbursement, in part, of registration fees and expenses incurred by producer farmers and processors. \n              Our third goal is to assist in building a stronger ag community and industry overall for the future. To do this, we sponsor young women from universities and colleges who are studying agriculture, 4-H members, and any of those who apply in the community, by covering their registration and hotel accommodation. This is done by myself personally and by industry stakeholders who are interested in doing so. To date, we have sponsored over 50 students from across Canada. \n              \n              AWC is recognized in supporting, celebrating, and recognizing the contribution that women make in the industry. Women participants leave more confident, enthused, and motivated, and are more apt, therefore, to be advocates in the industry and involved in industry associations and boards. \n              We have supported many women networks in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario. We have also provided a network for women who, for example, are widows raising families and want to keep the farm for their children growing up. We've built a network of over 25 farmers across the Canada-U.S. border, so that they have this network of support. \n              We've been asked to bring the conference to the United States and Africa. We have also been approached by other industries in the insurance, energy, food, restaurant, and hotel associations. We also support women in youth groups, to get involved not only with 4-H but with others. \n              Our overall goal is to have women involved in agriculture and food to benefit from AWC, not only from the speakers but from each other. We are considered today to be the largest leadership conference for women in agriculture, where women in agriculture can join a community of their peers to listen, learn, network, and grow. \n              We have more than 2,800 followers on Twitter, more than 860 connections on Facebook, and more than 9,000 connections on LinkedIn. Our YouTube station, which we created last year, has been gathering thousands of people to view our videos of speakers from the conference. \n              I thank you very much."}, {"turn": 69, "speakerID": "219057", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Excellent. \n              We're going to start our round of questioning with my colleague, Ms. Damoff. \n              You have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 70, "speakerID": "219058", "name": "Ms. Pam Damoff (Oakville North—Burlington, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              I want to thank both of you for being here today and for being trailblazers in what both of you are doing to encourage young women to seek careers in fields that are not traditionally filled by females. \n               I'm going to turn to Dorothy first.

I have that on my mind for next year to open up that avenue to them.\n              Women are still under-represented in leadership in agriculture. How can we go about changing that?

I'm from Lethbridge, Alberta, so agriculture is big for us, in both ag production and science and tech. I have a keen desire to understand this industry, as well as a desire to see more women in this field. All of that is to say that I have just a few reflections to start with. \n              Ms. Byers, one of the things you talked about is the difference in income with regard to women. I certainly would agree with you. Women do not make as much as men do, but I want to clarify something, because we have new data from Stats Canada. What that data shows is that the hourly wage of a full-time woman worker is 88% that of men, rather than 72¢ per dollar, which is what I think you said. StatsCan also shows, when comparing women and men with the same demographic, work, and workplace characteristics, that it's actually 92% of what men earn. We are seeing an increase. We're seeing a good trajectory. I'm not saying that we don't have a way to go—we certainly do—but I think where we're making gains, it's worth acknowledging and celebrating those gains.\n              Perhaps on that note, too, I'll highlight this. Interestingly enough, in terms of the points in history where we've seen the greatest gains made, when we look back to 1976 and move all the way to 2016, the greatest gains were made between 1988 and 1994, when Brian Mulroney was in place, and then from 2004 to 2008, when Stephen Harper was in place. I think there's something to be said there, and that is, the economic platforms that were put in place during those times were based on balanced budgets and economic responsibility with regard to fiscal management. I do think that plays a role here, because there is a larger picture to be considered. We want to enter into specific industries and see women championed, of course, but I think we also have to care for the entire economy as a whole. There is much to be said for that as well in making sure that we thrive as a country, both locally within our national economy and also on the international stage.\n               That's my bigger picture for context, but it leads me to this question. Iris, you talked about 4-H. Within my riding, I've seen the impact 4-H has had. I also was raised on a small farm in a rural area and was quite engaged in the different community initiatives, so I've seen the way 4-H impacts a young person's professional development, their confidence, skills, and abilities, and even their decision-making as they go forward into the workforce or to university or college.\n              I'm wondering if you can comment on the different benefits you've seen from that, specifically in the context of this study, which is women and girls and the decisions they're making with regard to university and college education, I guess, as well as the professional fields that they choose to go into."}, {"turn": 89, "speakerID": "232761", "name": "Ms. Iris Meck", "contribution": "Thanks, Rachael.\n              I fully agree. I think 4-H is a tremendous training ground and foundation for women in agriculture. Personally, I see them as more dedicated to a goal. I see them as more directed, more confident, and understanding the principles of leadership much more than women who don't go to an organization such as 4-H, which gives them a tremendous step up."}, {"turn": 90, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "What are some of those skill sets that you see them being able to develop and bring into the workforce with them, based on a program such as 4-H?"}, {"turn": 91, "speakerID": "232761", "name": "Ms. Iris Meck", "contribution": "I'm sorry to say that I wasn't in 4-H, so....\n              \n                Voices: Oh, oh!"}, {"turn": 92, "speakerID": "217606", "name": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "contribution": "Okay.

We work with a lot of university students in my own practice at work and also through the conference. The 4-H students, if they're attending university, will always be the first to apply. They'll always have a presentation that is the most professional and the most put together; it doesn't look like their video was made at two o'clock in the morning with their hair sticking out after an event.\n               They're more put together. They're more classy. They reach that level of professionalism a lot more than if they had not attended 4-H.

Networking is the time when you can meet somebody who you can take advantage of, in the sense that it will take you to another level, that it will give you an advantage.

We're not quite sure where we're going to land, or how we're going to do it, but I believe that as women, as role models, we help young girls understand that risk-taking is good. Girls in particular, little ones, have such curiosity about the world. They are fearless. We need to sustain that desire to test and to push and to challenge, to not be afraid of failure, and to understand that failure is the biggest teacher and the greatest teacher. It gives you an opportunity to understand how you could change things to make them better. \n              That flies in the face of perfectionism in girls. As a society, we need to do everything we possibly can to help girls, at the youngest ages and all the way through, appreciate that they don't have to be perfect. They have to be brave. They have to be courageous. They have to know how to get around the glass obstacle course that they will face. I love the sticky floor, but the glass obstacle course also means that they will hit things that they don't know how to get over and around, or even see, but they will, because they have the resilience and they have the skills and they're not afraid of failing.
