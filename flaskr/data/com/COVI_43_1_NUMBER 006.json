In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters.\n              Finally, for members who will be speaking, we strongly recommend that you use a headset.

That is also the prevalent position in Quebec.\n              A few years ago, after the “Bombardier affair” in Quebec—I will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with it—three of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. A number of civil society groups in Quebec share it also. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. The idea is to offer support, but with conditions.\n              According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January 2, the 100 highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227 times more in 2018 than the average worker. The average salary for workers increased by 2.6% between 2017 and 2018. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. \n              Let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted. We cannot even imagine what the figures are today. At this point, we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss. Wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid, but clearly does not flow down to the base.\n              Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act."}, {"turn": 126, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "The honourable Minister has the floor.\n              I would also like to remind members to ask their questions through the Chair"}, {"turn": 127, "speakerID": "214320", "name": "Hon.

We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind.

Building on our work today, we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies and grows.\n              Over these past two and a half months, I have spent an inordinate amount of time with CEOs, with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast. A few days ago, I convened a meeting of CEOs from all parts of this country, from Quebec to British Columbia, to talk to them about solutions, about answers.\n              The liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them. We will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the COVID crisis, so we make sure that—"}, {"turn": 253, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "The next question will go to Mr. Dalton."}, {"turn": 254, "speakerID": "261593", "name": "Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n              I'm hearing from small business owners like Joel, who runs a fitness club here in Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge, and is very concerned that their landlords refuse to participate in the rent assistance program.

That's why we've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance.\n              With respect to rent support, we are encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity I talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there.\n              We will continue to support small businesses. We believe this program has significant merit. It allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent.

It's a classic Liberal catch-22. \n              A worker may unknowingly make over the $1,000 by a couple of dollars.
