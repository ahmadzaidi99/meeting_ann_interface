Turn 0, A (Grad): Ah , so comfortable .
Turn 1, F (Grad): Smooth .
Turn 2, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Good . I know that he 's going to like , Taiwan and other places to eat . So .
Turn 3, D (Grad): On ? Am I on ?
Turn 4, A (Grad): Yep . Yep .
Turn 5, D (Grad): I think I 'm on ?
Turn 6, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 7, D (Grad): Good . Good .
Turn 8, A (Grad): Bye .
Turn 9, B (Grad): Actually {disfmarker}
Turn 10, F (Grad): I just had one of the most frustrating meetings of my career .
Turn 11, A (Grad): It 's definitely not the most frustrating meeting I 've ever had .
Turn 12, D (Grad): You a You 're {disfmarker} you remember you 're being recorded at this point .
Turn 13, A (Grad): Oh , yeah , so , w we didn't yet specify with whom .
Turn 14, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 15, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 16, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 17, A (Grad): But um .
Turn 18, E (Professor): Uh , right .
Turn 19, A (Grad): So that 's why Keith and I are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting .
Turn 20, E (Professor): Uh .
Turn 21, F (Grad): Huh . Yeah , I 'm just gonna sit here and
Turn 22, E (Professor): Right . Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I avoided that as long as I could for you guys ,
Turn 23, F (Grad): growl .
Turn 24, E (Professor): but , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 25, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 26, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 27, F (Grad): For which we thank you , by the way .
Turn 28, A (Grad): Are very appreciative , yeah .
Turn 29, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 30, F (Grad): I know you were {disfmarker} you were doing that , but , anyway .
Turn 31, D (Grad): Oh yeah , how di how d exactly did , uh , that paper lead to anti - lock brakes ?
Turn 32, F (Grad): Oh , I could tell you had a rough day , man !
Turn 33, D (Grad): Nah .
Turn 34, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 35, D (Grad): I love that story .
Turn 36, F (Grad): Yeah , it 's a great story .
Turn 37, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 38, F (Grad): Oh my goodness .
Turn 39, C (Grad): Oh yeah , um , Liz suggested we could start off by uh , doing the digits all at the same time .
Turn 40, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 41, D (Grad): All at the same time . I don't know if {disfmarker} I would get distracted and confused , probably .
Turn 42, E (Professor): e
Turn 43, A (Grad): Really ? Do we have to like , synchronize ?
Turn 44, E (Professor): Well , I think you 're supposed to {disfmarker} OK . We can do this .
Turn 45, F (Grad): Are you being silly ?
Turn 46, D (Grad): Oh wait do we have t
Turn 47, E (Professor): Everybody 's got different digits ,
Turn 48, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 49, E (Professor): right ?
Turn 50, D (Grad): Yeah , do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping {disfmarker}
Turn 51, F (Grad): Uh .
Turn 52, A (Grad): You 're kidding .
Turn 53, C (Grad): No , no , just {disfmarker} just start whenever you want .
Turn 54, E (Professor): No .
Turn 55, A (Grad): And any rate ?
Turn 56, E (Professor): e yeah , the
Turn 57, F (Grad): Alright .
Turn 58, E (Professor): Well , they {disfmarker} they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us ,
Turn 59, A (Grad): Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 60, E (Professor): so {disfmarker}
Turn 61, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 62, E (Professor): yeah , there 's separate channels .
Turn 63, F (Grad): Alright .
Turn 64, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 65, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 66, E (Professor): So when I say
Turn 67, F (Grad): Just plug one ear .
Turn 68, A (Grad): You lose .
Turn 69, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 70, F (Grad): OK , bye ! That was a great meeting !
Turn 71, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 72, D (Grad): Alright .
Turn 73, F (Grad): So - {vocalsound} Now , uh , why ?
Turn 74, C (Grad): Just to save time .
Turn 75, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 76, C (Grad): Does matter for them .
Turn 77, A (Grad): Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on ?
Turn 78, E (Professor): No .
Turn 79, A (Grad): Oh . Too bad . I kinda like it .
Turn 80, F (Grad): Well , could we ?
Turn 81, D (Grad): It 's strangely satisfying .
Turn 82, A (Grad): Yeah . It 's a ritual .
Turn 83, D (Grad): Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? Is that
Turn 84, C (Grad): We could .
Turn 85, D (Grad): true ?
Turn 86, A (Grad): We are ?
Turn 87, C (Grad): We might .
Turn 88, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 89, D (Grad): Is {disfmarker}
Turn 90, E (Professor): Well , you {disfmarker} you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . One was rehearse your i i talk {disfmarker}
Turn 91, D (Grad): Oh yes , and that too .
Turn 92, C (Grad): Not {disfmarker} not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . And the same is true for the proposal . I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , um . I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it
Turn 93, A (Grad): I haven't looked at it
Turn 94, C (Grad): because {disfmarker}
Turn 95, A (Grad): yet ,
Turn 96, C (Grad): but you could always send me comments per electronic mail
Turn 97, A (Grad): but I will .
Turn 98, C (Grad): and they will be incorporated .
Turn 99, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 100, C (Grad): Um , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} It basically says , well " this is construal " , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model {pause} to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what
Turn 101, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 102, C (Grad): in our beloved tourism domain . But , with a focus on
Turn 103, A (Grad): Can I s Sorry .
Turn 104, F (Grad): I think I need a copy of this , yes .
Turn 105, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 106, D (Grad): OK , we can {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} we can pass {disfmarker} pass my , uh {disfmarker} we can pass my extra copy around .
Turn 107, F (Grad): I is there an extra copy around ?
Turn 108, A (Grad): Uh . He sent it . OK . You can keep it .
Turn 109, D (Grad): Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it ,
Turn 110, F (Grad): Alrigh
Turn 111, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 112, C (Grad): Um , I don't {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} I don't need it .
Turn 113, D (Grad): but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK .
Turn 114, C (Grad): Um , actually this is the {disfmarker} the newest version after your comments ,
Turn 115, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 116, C (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 117, E (Professor): Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that .
Turn 118, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 119, E (Professor): Yep .
Turn 120, D (Grad): Oh , maybe the version I didn't have that I {disfmarker} mine {disfmarker} the w did the one you sent on the email have the {disfmarker}
Turn 121, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 122, D (Grad): That was the most recent one ?
Turn 123, E (Professor): Uh , yeah , I think so .
Turn 124, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 125, D (Grad): OK . Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing .
Turn 126, A (Grad): I 'm changing this . Just so you know .
Turn 127, C (Grad): Yeah ,
Turn 128, A (Grad): But , anyway .
Turn 129, C (Grad): um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d
Turn 130, A (Grad): Oh . Oh , sorry . OK . Sorry .
Turn 131, C (Grad): current formalism thing that you presented .
Turn 132, A (Grad): OK . I will . OK . OK . OK .
Turn 133, C (Grad): But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 134, A (Grad): We can talk about it later . That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever .
Turn 135, C (Grad): And {disfmarker}
Turn 136, A (Grad): I 'm making changes . " Don't worry about that . " OK . Mmm - mmm . Oh ! OK , sorry , go on .
Turn 137, C (Grad): And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or
Turn 138, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 139, C (Grad): readability {disfmarker}
Turn 140, F (Grad): There 's only one " S " in " interesting " .
Turn 141, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 142, F (Grad): There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . On page five .
Turn 143, C (Grad): Interesting .
Turn 144, A (Grad): Anyway . And y uh , email any time , but most usefully before {disfmarker}
Turn 145, D (Grad): The twenty - first I 'm assuming .
Turn 146, A (Grad): The twenty - first ?
Turn 147, C (Grad): Twenty - ninth .
Turn 148, E (Professor): No , this is the twenty - first .
Turn 149, F (Grad): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 150, D (Grad): What , today 's the twenty - first ?
Turn 151, F (Grad): Well , better hurry up then !
Turn 152, D (Grad): Oh , man !
Turn 153, A (Grad): Before the twenty - ninth ,
Turn 154, C (Grad): The twenty - ninth .
Turn 155, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 156, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 157, C (Grad): That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea .
Turn 158, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . OK .
Turn 159, C (Grad): OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning {disfmarker} The Cave Forty - Five is a {disfmarker} is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that {disfmarker} that time . And so
Turn 160, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 161, C (Grad): they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine {disfmarker} nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um , {vocalsound} and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth
Turn 162, F (Grad): Oh , you 've got the parser done . Sorry .
Turn 163, C (Grad): That 's the {disfmarker} not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser ,
Turn 164, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 165, A (Grad): Easy parser .
Turn 166, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 167, C (Grad): and the generation outputter .
Turn 168, D (Grad): Halfway done ? Yeah .
Turn 169, C (Grad): That 's done .
Turn 170, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 171, C (Grad): You have to change those strategies ,
Turn 172, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 173, C (Grad): right ? That 's , ten words ?
Turn 174, D (Grad): Yeah . Well , i it , you know . Maybe twelve .
Turn 175, C (Grad): Twelve ? OK . And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about {disfmarker} uh , actually I have an example , probably . Two s Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on .
Turn 176, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 177, A (Grad): I could hear it .
Turn 178, D (Grad): I I can hear it .
Turn 179, F (Grad): I heard it .
Turn 180, D (Grad): They might not hear it in the {disfmarker} well maybe they will . I don't know .
Turn 181, A (Grad): This was an actual , um , subject ? Ah .
Turn 182, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 183, F (Grad): Sounds like Fey .
Turn 184, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 185, C (Grad): But they 're {disfmarker} they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer ,
Turn 186, F (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 187, C (Grad): the {disfmarker} you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine .
Turn 188, F (Grad): Oh really . Interesting . Oh , it 's pretty slow .
Turn 189, C (Grad): Yeah , you have to {disfmarker}
Turn 190, A (Grad): Wh
Turn 191, F (Grad): The system breaking .
Turn 192, A (Grad): What is the s ? Oh !
Turn 193, C (Grad): OK . And so forth and so forth . Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh {disfmarker} how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit {disfmarker} as much as I {pause} can about the NTL story . I {disfmarker} I wa I do wanna , um {disfmarker} I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are {disfmarker} or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , {vocalsound} talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from {disfmarker} but I have the paper , I can make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think .
Turn 194, A (Grad): Oh . I was like , " where 'd you get that ? " OK .
Turn 195, F (Grad): Yeah , that looks familiar .
Turn 196, A (Grad): " Looks familiar . "
Turn 197, C (Grad): I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other .
Turn 198, A (Grad): Uh .
Turn 199, E (Professor): Whatever .
Turn 200, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 201, C (Grad): Um , and that 's {disfmarker} now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . So X - schemas , then , I would like to do {disfmarker} talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net .
Turn 202, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 203, C (Grad): End of story . Anything I forgot that we should mention ? Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started {disfmarker} going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ?
Turn 204, E (Professor): You certainly can . I mean I y I you know , I don't know {disfmarker}
Turn 205, A (Grad): You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment , to something .
Turn 206, E (Professor): Right , um .
Turn 207, C (Grad): " Future activities " something .
Turn 208, E (Professor): Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking
Turn 209, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 210, E (Professor): and , you know , the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} that the plan is to see to what extent the {disfmarker} you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that {disfmarker}
Turn 211, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 212, E (Professor): and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . So that 's one thing . Um . Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , OK ?
Turn 213, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 214, E (Professor): which , uh , actually , i i even on your five - layer slide , you {disfmarker} you 've got an old one that {disfmarker} that leaves that off .
Turn 215, C (Grad): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do have it here .
Turn 216, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 217, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 218, C (Grad): Um . And , of course , you know , the {disfmarker} the big picture is this bit .
Turn 219, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 220, C (Grad): But , you know , it would {disfmarker} But I don't think I {disfmarker} I am capable of {disfmarker} of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be {disfmarker} you know , it would be nice to tell people how {disfmarker} what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works ,
Turn 221, E (Professor): OK , so , so anyway , I {disfmarker} I agree that 's not central .
Turn 222, C (Grad): but {disfmarker}
Turn 223, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 224, E (Professor): What you might wanna do is , um , and may not , but you might wanna {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and , um , how the construction and simulation {disfmarker} that ho that whole th
Turn 225, C (Grad): Yeah , th that {disfmarker} that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide ,
Turn 226, A (Grad): OK , right .
Turn 227, C (Grad): so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy ,
Turn 228, A (Grad): OK , I can give you a more recent {disfmarker} if you want {disfmarker}
Turn 229, C (Grad): one of Nancy 's st
Turn 230, A (Grad): well , that might have enough .
Turn 231, C (Grad): Uh , I {disfmarker} yeah , but I also have stuff you {disfmarker} trash you left over ,
Turn 232, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 233, C (Grad): your quals and your triple - AI .
Turn 234, E (Professor): The quals w the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the quals slides would be fine .
Turn 235, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 236, E (Professor): You could get it out of there , or some
Turn 237, A (Grad): Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little {disfmarker} few changes , not a big deal . Yeah , you could steal anything you want , I don't care . Which you 've already done , obviously . So . Sorry
Turn 238, C (Grad): Well , I {disfmarker} I don't feel bad about it at all
Turn 239, A (Grad): No , you shouldn't .
Turn 240, C (Grad): because {disfmarker} because you are on the , uh , title .
Turn 241, A (Grad): Oh , that 's great , that 's great .
Turn 242, C (Grad): I mean on the {disfmarker} the , you 're {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} see , that 's you .
Turn 243, A (Grad): I 'm glad to see propagation .
Turn 244, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 245, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 246, C (Grad): Hmm ? Propagated ?
Turn 247, A (Grad): Yes .
Turn 248, C (Grad): I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so .
Turn 249, A (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} it 's certainly related , um ,
Turn 250, C (Grad): Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig .
Turn 251, A (Grad): might wanna say . Is it ?
Turn 252, C (Grad): So it {disfmarker} It 's on biocomputation . Would {disfmarker}
Turn 253, E (Professor): Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building .
Turn 254, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 255, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 256, A (Grad): Kind of a different level of analysis .
Turn 257, E (Professor): The {disfmarker} yeah it was {disfmarker} it turns out that if {disfmarker} if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , and {disfmarker}
Turn 258, D (Grad): Wait , they 're building a building in the shape of DNA ,
Turn 259, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 260, D (Grad): is that what you said ?
Turn 261, E (Professor): Roughly , yeah .
Turn 262, F (Grad): Oh ! Oh boy !
Turn 263, A (Grad): O
Turn 264, E (Professor): Including cr cross - bridges ,
Turn 265, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 266, E (Professor): and
Turn 267, A (Grad): Oh my god !
Turn 268, F (Grad): That 's brilliant ! Hhh .
Turn 269, E (Professor): You d you really {disfmarker} now I I spent {disfmarker} the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is , um {disfmarker}
Turn 270, A (Grad): Of what
Turn 271, D (Grad): Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research ,
Turn 272, A (Grad): the building ?
Turn 273, D (Grad): you know ?
Turn 274, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 275, D (Grad): That 's horrible .
Turn 276, E (Professor): Right . Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers .
Turn 277, A (Grad): And give them more money . They just want a fun place for them to {disfmarker} to work .
Turn 278, E (Professor): Right . Right .
Turn 279, F (Grad): And everybody gets a trampoline in their office .
Turn 280, C (Grad): Well , the {disfmarker} the offices are actually a little {disfmarker} the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in {disfmarker} in the glass half - dome .
Turn 281, A (Grad): Really ?
Turn 282, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 283, F (Grad): Alright , let 's stop talking about this .
Turn 284, A (Grad): Does it exist yet ?
Turn 285, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 286, A (Grad): They are w now building it ?
Turn 287, C (Grad): Uh , as a model .
Turn 288, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 289, C (Grad): But I th
Turn 290, E (Professor): So , yeah , I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the {disfmarker} this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig and the {disfmarker} the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . OK . OK . Anyway ! Enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal .
Turn 291, C (Grad): Yeah , if somebody has something to say .
Turn 292, E (Professor): Yep .
Turn 293, F (Grad): You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . Like I believe you had " Jackendorf " .
Turn 294, E (Professor): Um .
Turn 295, F (Grad): Uh , unless there 's a person called " Jackendorf " ,
Turn 296, A (Grad): On that one ?
Turn 297, E (Professor): No , no , no .
Turn 298, F (Grad): yeah . But that 's the only thing I noticed in there .
Turn 299, A (Grad): In the presentation ?
Turn 300, F (Grad): In the presentation .
Turn 301, A (Grad): I 'll probably {disfmarker} I c might have {disfmarker} I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . Anyway .
Turn 302, C (Grad): Oh , in the presentation here .
Turn 303, A (Grad): Yeah , that 's what he was talking about .
Turn 304, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 305, C (Grad): I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible . That 's copy and paste from something .
Turn 306, E (Professor): So I did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet .
Turn 307, C (Grad): Uh , it did , there is a reference to Srini {disfmarker}
Turn 308, E (Professor): Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place {disfmarker} Oh , did you put in something about ,
Turn 309, A (Grad): Metonymy and metaphor here , right ?
Turn 310, E (Professor): uh , the individual , we 'd talked about putting in something about people had , uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah , OK . Good . I see where you have it . So the top of the second {disfmarker} of pa page two you have a sentence .
Turn 311, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 312, E (Professor): But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet , about {disfmarker} we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . Is that in there ?
Turn 313, C (Grad): Yeah , mmm . Um .
Turn 314, E (Professor): Uh , OK , so where {disfmarker} where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look .
Turn 315, C (Grad): Um , but I {disfmarker} I did not focus on that aspect but , um {disfmarker} Ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph before two . So on page two , um , the main focus {disfmarker}
Turn 316, E (Professor): Uh , OK . Yeah .
Turn 317, C (Grad): But that 's really {disfmarker}
Turn 318, A (Grad): That 's not about that , is it ?
Turn 319, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 320, E (Professor): No , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it s says it but it doesn't say {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker} it d it d
Turn 321, C (Grad): Why .
Turn 322, E (Professor): yeah , it doesn't give the punch line .
Turn 323, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 324, E (Professor): Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at {disfmarker} at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .
Turn 325, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 326, E (Professor): And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .
Turn 327, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 328, E (Professor): And it {disfmarker} to the extent that that 's true then {disfmarker} then it 's a big win over anything that exists .
Turn 329, D (Grad): So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .
Turn 330, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 331, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one {disfmarker} and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff {comment} {disfmarker} you can do the same grammar .
Turn 332, D (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 333, E (Professor): And it is the same grammar . But , um , the trick is that the {disfmarker} the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . Well , " trouble " isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container .
Turn 334, D (Grad): Right .
Turn 335, E (Professor): Et cetera . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's where this , um ,
Turn 336, D (Grad): So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule .
Turn 337, E (Professor): Right . So 's it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .
Turn 338, C (Grad): No , it doesn't say it at all . No . Even though {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One could argue what {disfmarker} if there are basic cases , even . I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free .
Turn 339, E (Professor): Oh , nothing is context - free , but there are basic cases . That is , um , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there {disfmarker} you know , et cetera .
Turn 340, C (Grad): But " walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , " and " walked into the cafe and broke his nose , " that 's sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 341, E (Professor): Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous .
Turn 342, C (Grad): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 343, E (Professor): I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as {disfmarker} as a obstacle ,
Turn 344, F (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 345, E (Professor): or as some physical object . So there are multiple construals . And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal .
Turn 346, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yep .
Turn 347, E (Professor): The b the {disfmarker} the double arrow .
Turn 348, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 349, E (Professor): So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away .
Turn 350, C (Grad): No .
Turn 351, E (Professor): But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle .
Turn 352, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 353, E (Professor): And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading .
Turn 354, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 355, D (Grad): You con {disfmarker} you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , " Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? " uh , oh , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 356, F (Grad): He slipped on the wet floor .
Turn 357, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 358, C (Grad): You don't find that usage , uh {disfmarker} uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus .
Turn 359, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 360, C (Grad): The " walk into it " never really means , w as in walked smack {disfmarker}
Turn 361, E (Professor): But " run into " does .
Turn 362, C (Grad): Yeah , but , y y if you find " walked smacked into the cafe " or " slammed into the wall " {disfmarker}
Turn 363, E (Professor): Yeah , no , but " run into " does .
Turn 364, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 365, E (Professor): Because you will find " run into , " uh ,
Turn 366, D (Grad): Cars run into telephone poles all the time .
Turn 367, E (Professor): well , or " into the cafe " for that m
Turn 368, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 369, E (Professor): you know {disfmarker} " His car ran into the cafe . "
Turn 370, C (Grad): Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run .
Turn 371, E (Professor): Well , you can " run into " in that sense too .
Turn 372, A (Grad): Yeah , " run into " might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense .
Turn 373, E (Professor): But , uh , Right .
Turn 374, F (Grad): Depends .
Turn 375, E (Professor): But {disfmarker} Like , " run into an old friend " , it probably needs its own construction . I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else
Turn 376, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 377, E (Professor): and maybe it is , but , um , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but , um {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 378, A (Grad): All contact . I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't {disfmarker} social contact , whatever . I mean .
Turn 379, E (Professor): Uh .
Turn 380, F (Grad): Sudden surprising contact ,
Turn 381, E (Professor): Yeah , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Right . i Yeah , it 's more {disfmarker}
Turn 382, F (Grad): right ?
Turn 383, A (Grad): Forceful .
Turn 384, F (Grad): But of course , no , i i I mean it has a life of its own . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial {disfmarker}
Turn 385, E (Professor): Well , this is this motivated {disfmarker} but yeah {disfmarker}
Turn 386, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 387, E (Professor): oh yeah , mo for sure , motivated , but then you can't parse on motivated .
Turn 388, F (Grad): Yeah . Yeah . Right .
Turn 389, E (Professor): Uh ,
Turn 390, A (Grad): Too bad .
Turn 391, D (Grad): You should get a T - shirt that says that .
Turn 392, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 393, A (Grad): There 's {disfmarker} there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of , but , uh , this has gotten {disfmarker} I mean wh We don't need the words to that .
Turn 394, C (Grad): Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today .
Turn 395, A (Grad): What ? Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there .
Turn 396, C (Grad): Not {disfmarker} not your marks .
Turn 397, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 398, E (Professor): OK , so , um ,
Turn 399, F (Grad): In other news .
Turn 400, E (Professor): anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal , you got {disfmarker}
Turn 401, C (Grad): Well ,
Turn 402, E (Professor): We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it .
Turn 403, C (Grad): Well there {disfmarker} actually {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain . So maybe if we w if we can make one up {pause} now , that would be c incredibly helpful .
Turn 404, A (Grad): So , w where it should illustrate
Turn 405, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 406, A (Grad): uh {disfmarker} wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff ,
Turn 407, C (Grad): How {disfmarker}
Turn 408, A (Grad): as well as , mappings ?
Turn 409, C (Grad): w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something
Turn 410, E (Professor): Right {disfmarker} right {disfmarker} r
Turn 411, C (Grad): and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we {disfmarker} we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the {disfmarker} to the domain .
Turn 412, E (Professor): OK , f let 's {disfmarker} let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " . I mean , that 's what you started with .
Turn 413, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 414, E (Professor): So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . OK .
Turn 415, C (Grad): I had two hours w with George on this , so it ,
Turn 416, E (Professor): OK , what did he say .
Turn 417, A (Grad): Did you ?
Turn 418, C (Grad): um {disfmarker} Um .
Turn 419, A (Grad): Join the club .
Turn 420, E (Professor): Right . Oh , h that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 421, C (Grad): " On the bus " is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on {disfmarker} on that path and th w I mean it 's {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} there 's a platform notion ,
Turn 422, E (Professor): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I believe all that , it 's just {disfmarker}
Turn 423, C (Grad): right ? " he 's on the {disfmarker} standing on the bus waving to me . "
Turn 424, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 425, C (Grad): But th the regular as we speak " J Johno was on the bus to New York , "
Turn 426, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 427, C (Grad): um , uh , he 's {disfmarker} that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something ,
Turn 428, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 429, C (Grad): where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight ,
Turn 430, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 431, C (Grad): and you can be , you know , on the wagon .
Turn 432, E (Professor): Right . So {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} that may or may not be what you {disfmarker} what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler
Turn 433, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 434, E (Professor): like " under the bus , " or something , where {disfmarker}
Turn 435, C (Grad): But it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . So .
Turn 436, E (Professor): Well , unless he was repairing it or something ,
Turn 437, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 438, E (Professor): but yeah .
Turn 439, C (Grad): But um .
Turn 440, E (Professor): Uh , but OK .
Turn 441, C (Grad): So in terms of the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker}
Turn 442, A (Grad): I see .
Turn 443, C (Grad): We had {disfmarker} we had {disfmarker} initially we 'd {disfmarker} started discussing the " out of film . "
Turn 444, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 445, C (Grad): And there 's a lot of " out of " analysis , so , um ,
Turn 446, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 447, C (Grad): could we capture that with a different construal of {disfmarker}
Turn 448, A (Grad): Yeah , it 's a little {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} we 've thought about it before , uh t uh {disfmarker} to use the examples in other papers , and it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little complicated . Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of {disfmarker} there 's resource ,
Turn 449, F (Grad): Out of {disfmarker} out of film , in particular .
Turn 450, A (Grad): right , and like , what is film ,
Turn 451, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 452, A (Grad): the state {disfmarker} you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource .
Turn 453, F (Grad): It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 454, A (Grad): I mean .
Turn 455, F (Grad): yeah , I mean ,
Turn 456, A (Grad): It 's a little bit {disfmarker}
Turn 457, F (Grad): but {disfmarker} and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like , " The film ran out " you know , or , maybe you could say something like " The film is out "
Turn 458, A (Grad): Yeah , is film the trajector ?
Turn 459, F (Grad): so like the {disfmarker} the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . The {disfmarker} the film {disfmarker} the film is gone , right ? Um , I never really knew what was going on , I mean I {disfmarker} I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that {disfmarker} that " I 'm out of film " means that I have left the state of having film or something like that ,
Turn 460, A (Grad): It 's weird . That {disfmarker}
Turn 461, F (Grad): but .
Turn 462, A (Grad): Or , " having " is also , um , associated with location ,
Turn 463, E (Professor): Uh .
Turn 464, A (Grad): right ?
Turn 465, F (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 466, A (Grad): so if the film left , you know {disfmarker} state is being near film .
Turn 467, C (Grad): So running {disfmarker} running out of something is different from being out of somewhere .
Turn 468, E (Professor): Or being out of something as , uh {disfmarker} as well . So " running out of it " definitely has a process aspect to it .
Turn 469, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . But that 's from run , yeah .
Turn 470, E (Professor): So ,
Turn 471, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 472, E (Professor): b that 's OK ,
Turn 473, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 474, E (Professor): I mean {disfmarker} b but the difference
Turn 475, C (Grad): Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it .
Turn 476, E (Professor): is {disfmarker}
Turn 477, A (Grad): Yeah . So th
Turn 478, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 479, F (Grad): Yeah . You got there .
Turn 480, A (Grad): That part is fine .
Turn 481, F (Grad): You got to out of it .
Turn 482, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 483, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 484, E (Professor): But , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 485, F (Grad): Hmm !
Turn 486, E (Professor): Yeah , so {disfmarker} so nob so no one has in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} of the , uh , professional linguists ,
Turn 487, A (Grad): Uh .
Turn 488, E (Professor): they haven't {disfmarker} there was this whole thesis on " out of " .
Turn 489, A (Grad): There was ? Who ?
Turn 490, E (Professor): Well , there {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker} or there was a paper on it .
Turn 491, F (Grad): Out .
Turn 492, E (Professor): Huh ?
Turn 493, F (Grad): There was one on {disfmarker} on " out " or " out of " ?
Turn 494, E (Professor): There was a Well , it may be just " out " . Yeah .
Turn 495, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 496, E (Professor): I think there was " over " but there was also a paper on " out " .
Turn 497, F (Grad): Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner ,
Turn 498, A (Grad): Oh , yeah , you 're right . Yeah .
Turn 499, E (Professor): Or something .
Turn 500, F (Grad): right ? The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} " the syrup spread out " ?
Turn 501, E (Professor): Yeah , and all that sort of stuff .
Turn 502, F (Grad): That kind of thing ?
Turn 503, A (Grad): Yeah . And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics ,
Turn 504, E (Professor): OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week .
Turn 505, A (Grad): but . Yeah .
Turn 506, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 507, E (Professor): OK . So , um {disfmarker}
Turn 508, A (Grad): It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones {disfmarker} forward ones to defend , so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes {disfmarker}
Turn 509, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 510, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 511, A (Grad): th these are {disfmarker} you 're addressing like , computational linguists ,
Turn 512, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 513, A (Grad): right . Or {disfmarker} are you ?
Turn 514, C (Grad): There 's gonna be four computational linguists ,
Turn 515, A (Grad): OK . But more emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ?
Turn 516, C (Grad): computer it 's {disfmarker} More {disfmarker} there 's going to be the {disfmarker} just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists .
Turn 517, A (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 518, E (Professor): No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes
Turn 519, C (Grad): Oh , the thesis !
Turn 520, A (Grad): Oh , I meant this ,
Turn 521, E (Professor): it 's just for one guy .
Turn 522, C (Grad): That 's {disfmarker} that 's computa should be very computational ,
Turn 523, A (Grad): you know , like {disfmarker} OK . So I would try to {disfmarker} I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff .
Turn 524, C (Grad): and , uh , someth
Turn 525, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 526, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 527, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 528, A (Grad): You know , it 's an obvious one {disfmarker}
Turn 529, F (Grad): Totally weird stuff .
Turn 530, C (Grad): I mean the {disfmarker} the old bakery example might be nice ,
Turn 531, A (Grad): but , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 532, C (Grad): " Is there a bakery around here " . So if you c we really just construe it as a {disfmarker}
Turn 533, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 534, A (Grad): Around ?
Turn 535, C (Grad): No , it 's the bakery itself {disfmarker}
Turn 536, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 537, C (Grad): is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ?
Turn 538, A (Grad): Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right .
Turn 539, C (Grad): And then {disfmarker}
Turn 540, A (Grad): Nnn . No . What ? " Bakery " can't be something you 're gonna eat .
Turn 541, E (Professor): No , no . The question is d do you wanna {disfmarker} do you wanna construe {disfmarker} do you wanna constr - strue
Turn 542, F (Grad): Sh
Turn 543, D (Grad): It 's a speech - act .
Turn 544, E (Professor): r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} i for example , if {disfmarker} y
Turn 545, A (Grad): Yeah . Where you can get baked goods .
Turn 546, E (Professor): Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something . But the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or ,
Turn 547, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 548, E (Professor): um , pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and {disfmarker} there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery
Turn 549, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 550, E (Professor): that doesn't mean , " I want to buy some baked goods . "
Turn 551, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 552, E (Professor): But {vocalsound} um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples .
Turn 553, A (Grad): So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that
Turn 554, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 555, C (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 556, E (Professor): There 's all sorts of stuff going on .
Turn 557, A (Grad): might be beyond what you want to do .
Turn 558, E (Professor): So let 's {disfmarker} so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . So let 's first do a {disfmarker} So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the {disfmarker} Though , the one you have isn't quite {disfmarker}
Turn 559, A (Grad): You mean the s You mean " the steak wants to pay " ?
Turn 560, E (Professor): N no not that one , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker} the sort of background . This is the t uh , page five .
Turn 561, D (Grad): About Plato and the book ?
Turn 562, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 563, E (Professor): No .
Turn 564, A (Grad): Um .
Turn 565, C (Grad): No .
Turn 566, A (Grad): How much does it cost ?
Turn 567, E (Professor): Just beyond that .
Turn 568, F (Grad): Onward .
Turn 569, C (Grad): Where is the castle ?
Turn 570, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 571, F (Grad): A castle .
Turn 572, C (Grad): How old is it ? How much does it cost ?
Turn 573, D (Grad): Oh .
Turn 574, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 575, A (Grad): To go in , that 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 576, F (Grad): Two hundred million dollars .
Turn 577, E (Professor): Right . It 's not for sale . Uh . So
Turn 578, F (Grad): Yeah , I think that 's a good example , actually .
Turn 579, C (Grad): S
Turn 580, A (Grad): Yeah , that 's good . u
Turn 581, C (Grad): But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus .
Turn 582, A (Grad): Ellipsis .
Turn 583, C (Grad): Huh .
Turn 584, A (Grad): Like , " it " doesn't refer to " thing , " it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist {disfmarker} you could think of it that way , but .
Turn 585, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 586, F (Grad): Well , shoot , isn't that {disfmarker} I mean , that 's what {disfmarker}
Turn 587, C (Grad): Well , I mean , my argument here is {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's the same thing as " Plato 's on the top shelf , "
Turn 588, F (Grad): figuring that out is what this is about .
Turn 589, A (Grad): Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree .
Turn 590, C (Grad): I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using " Plato , "
Turn 591, A (Grad): Yeah . No no , I {disfmarker} I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um {disfmarker}
Turn 592, C (Grad): and you can refer back to it , and so you can {disfmarker} Castles have {disfmarker} as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say " Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? " Um . " How far is it from here ? "
Turn 593, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 594, C (Grad): So , You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so ,
Turn 595, A (Grad): Hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 596, C (Grad): www .
Turn 597, F (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 598, E (Professor): OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of " where " in the tourist 's domain ? Um .
Turn 599, F (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 600, E (Professor): So you know it 's {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you can sometimes use " where " f for " when "
Turn 601, F (Grad): O
Turn 602, E (Professor): in the sense of , you know , um , where {disfmarker} wh where {disfmarker} where was , um , " where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? " Or something .
Turn 603, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 604, F (Grad): Uh , yeah .
Turn 605, E (Professor): You know , or some such thing . Um .
Turn 606, F (Grad): Like what side were they on ,
Turn 607, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 608, E (Professor): Yeah . Essentially , yeah .
Turn 609, F (Grad): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 610, A (Grad): OK . I was like , " Huh ? It was here . " Like {disfmarker} {comment} Um .
Turn 611, E (Professor): But anyway th so there are {disfmarker} there are cases like that . Um ,
Turn 612, A (Grad): Ah ! Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could {disfmarker} I guess you could get that .
Turn 613, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 614, A (Grad): Um .
Turn 615, E (Professor): Um .
Turn 616, F (Grad): I mean , there 's also things like {disfmarker} I mean , s um , I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " in a sort of {disfmarker} doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number
Turn 617, E (Professor): Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah .
Turn 618, F (Grad): and I 'll call them or something like that ?
Turn 619, E (Professor): You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something .
Turn 620, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 621, E (Professor): But that 's not metaphorical .
Turn 622, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 623, E (Professor): It 's another {disfmarker}
Turn 624, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 625, E (Professor): So we 're thinking about , um , or we could also think about , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 626, C (Grad): Well , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 627, E (Professor): How about " I 'm in a hurry " ?
Turn 628, A (Grad): State .
Turn 629, E (Professor): It i But it 's a state {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the issue is , is that {disfmarker} it may be just a usage ,
Turn 630, F (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 631, E (Professor): you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know .
Turn 632, F (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 633, A (Grad): Right . So you want a more exotic one {disfmarker} version of that .
Turn 634, F (Grad): Oh .
Turn 635, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , right .
Turn 636, A (Grad): I 'm really into {disfmarker}
Turn 637, E (Professor): Ah ! How about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know , " I 'm in {disfmarker} I 'm in a state of exhaustion " ?
Turn 638, A (Grad): Do you really say that ?
Turn 639, E (Professor): or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ?
Turn 640, A (Grad): Would you really say that ?
Turn 641, E (Professor): A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . " Tu - stur tourists will often say that .
Turn 642, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 643, D (Grad): I I 'm really into art .
Turn 644, A (Grad): Yeah , I was gonna say , like {disfmarker}
Turn 645, D (Grad): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 646, E (Professor): Oh , you can do that ? Really ? Of course that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's definitely a , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 647, F (Grad): Fixed .
Turn 648, A (Grad): A fixed expression , yeah .
Turn 649, E (Professor): that 's a , uh {disfmarker} Right . But . {disfmarker}
Turn 650, A (Grad): There 're too {disfmarker} there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't {disfmarker} like uh " I 'm out of sorts now ! "
Turn 651, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 652, A (Grad): Like {comment} " I 'm in trouble ! "
Turn 653, C (Grad): Well I {disfmarker} when , uh {disfmarker} just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec
Turn 654, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 655, C (Grad): I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy .
Turn 656, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 657, A (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 658, C (Grad): So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build
Turn 659, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 660, C (Grad): you know , whatever . Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth .
Turn 661, E (Professor): Right . As an institution ,
Turn 662, C (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 663, E (Professor): yeah .
Turn 664, C (Grad): Um .
Turn 665, A (Grad): Why don't you want to use any of those ?
Turn 666, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 667, A (Grad): So y you don't wanna use one that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 668, C (Grad): Yeah , well {disfmarker} No , but this {disfmarker} that 's what I have , you know , started doing .
Turn 669, E (Professor): The castle {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that old castle one is sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 670, C (Grad): Metonymy , polysemy .
Turn 671, D (Grad): I love Van Gogh .
Turn 672, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 673, A (Grad): " I wanna go see the Van Gogh . "
Turn 674, E (Professor): Ah !
Turn 675, F (Grad): Oh geez .
Turn 676, A (Grad): Anyway , I 'm sorry .
Turn 677, C (Grad): But I think the argument should be {disfmarker} uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical ,
Turn 678, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 679, C (Grad): construal still is , uh , you know , completely , um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so , um .
Turn 680, E (Professor): Right . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a reasonable point , that it {disfmarker} in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy .
Turn 681, C (Grad): We , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} I looked {disfmarker} with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy .
Turn 682, E (Professor): And polysemy , and stuff like that . Yeah .
Turn 683, C (Grad): Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant .
Turn 684, F (Grad): I have to go .
Turn 685, E (Professor): Alright . Yeah .
Turn 686, C (Grad): But OK this is just something we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see , um ,
Turn 687, E (Professor): Right . s See you .
Turn 688, C (Grad): and deal with .
Turn 689, E (Professor): OK , well . I guess if anybody has additional suggestions ,
Turn 690, C (Grad): I mean maybe the " where is something " question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request .
Turn 691, E (Professor): w Yeah .
Turn 692, C (Grad): So , if we 're not talk about the lexic
Turn 693, A (Grad): Location versus what ?
Turn 694, C (Grad): instruction .
Turn 695, A (Grad): Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah .
Turn 696, E (Professor): Sure .
Turn 697, A (Grad): Oh , I thought that was {disfmarker} definitely treated as an example of construal .
Turn 698, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 699, A (Grad): Right ?
Turn 700, C (Grad): Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher .
Turn 701, A (Grad): Oh , you want a lexical example .
Turn 702, C (Grad): But I don't need it .
Turn 703, E (Professor): Well , you might want both .
Turn 704, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 705, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 706, C (Grad): Also it would be nice to get {disfmarker} ultimately to get a nice mental space example ,
Turn 707, E (Professor): We {disfmarker}
Turn 708, C (Grad): so , even temporal references are {disfmarker} just in the spatial domain are rare .
Turn 709, E (Professor): But it 's {disfmarker} it 's easy to make up plausible ones .
Turn 710, C (Grad): When {disfmarker} when you 're getting information on objects .
Turn 711, E (Professor): You know .
Turn 712, C (Grad): So , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 713, E (Professor): Right , you know {disfmarker} you know , where r Yeah . What color was this in {disfmarker} in in the nain nineteenth century .
Turn 714, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 715, E (Professor): What was this p instead of {disfmarker} wh what {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} how was this painted , what color was this painted , um , was this alleyway open .
Turn 716, C (Grad): Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run .
Turn 717, E (Professor): Uh .
Turn 718, C (Grad): We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth .
Turn 719, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . Wish you a good trip . All success .
Turn 720, D (Grad): For some reason when you said " feedback electronically " I thought of that {disfmarker} you ever see the Simpsons where they 're {disfmarker} like the family 's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ?
Turn 721, A (Grad): Yeah . That 's the {disfmarker} first one , I think . The very very first one .
Turn 722, D (Grad): It was a very early one . I don't know if it 's the first one .
Turn 723, A (Grad): Mmm . Mmm .
