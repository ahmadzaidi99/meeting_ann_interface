With me today is Les Linklater, our associate deputy minister, who joined us in early March; our chief financial officer, Marty Muldoon; and Lisa Campbell, our ADM responsible for our military procurement.\n              Let me first say that our hearts go out to the many Canadians who have been affected by the floods. As you know, our department is responsible for managing federal buildings and vital infrastructure. During the peak of the flooding, our officials closely monitored the situation to assess its impact on our bridges and on our dams. \n              \n              We also worked closely with the Department of National Defence and other partners, and maintained contingency plans to assist them with any emergency requests for suppliers such as sandbags.\n              As you know, Public Services and Procurement Canada, or PSPC, delivers a broad range of services that are essential to the federal government's day-to-day operations, from real property management to procurement to translation.\n              As the government's central purchasing agent, our department strives to use its spending power to generate meaningful economic and social benefits for Canadians.\n              \n              For example, it's estimated that contracts awarded to date through the national shipbuilding strategy will contribute close to $7.7 billion to Canada's GDP and create or maintain more than 7,000 jobs a year, on average, between 2012 and 2022. The strategy is spurring the economy and equipping our navy and coast guard with the ships they need to protect and serve Canadians.\n              \n              Public Services and Procurement Canada is also home to the translation bureau, which supports the federal government's efforts to communicate with Canadians in both official languages. In February, Minister Foote announced measures to strengthen the bureau's capacity to carry out its mandate.\n              Two days ago, I announced the appointment of Stéphan Déry as the new chief executive officer of the translation bureau. I am confident that he will provide the leadership needed to build strategic alliances and partner with stakeholders to position the translation bureau for long-term sustainable success.\n              Here on Parliament Hill, our important rehabilitation work continues. The West Block, the Government Conference Centre and Phase 1 of the Visitor Welcome Centre are progressing on time and on budget and will be ready as planned in fall 2018.\n              \n              I will now turn to Phoenix. I would like to begin by reminding the committee members how we got to the current situation. \n              In 2009 the government approved the transformation of pay administration initiative, which included two interconnected projects—the consolidation of pay services, which led to the creation of the public service pay centre in Miramichi, and the pay modernization project, which focused on replacing the government's antiquated pay technology. \n              Much of the attention related to pay issues was focused on Phoenix, the technology, but pay consolidation played a significant role in where we find ourselves today. In 2014 this consolidation resulted in the reduction of 700 compensation positions in 46 departments.\n              \n              Phoenix was implemented in February 2016, and this committee knows all too well that we soon began seeing pay problems. Now more than a year out, many people have asked how this could have happened. Let me share some of the reasons.\n              First, we had a backlog of employee cases to deal with shortly after Phoenix was launched. We underestimated the learning curve associated with Phoenix. We now know that the change management and common human resources processes were not completed before the implementation.\n              But most importantly, we lacked capacity in terms of personnel. We did not have enough experienced, knowledgeable pay experts to help transition to the new system or to compensate for the low levels of productivity. These 700-plus compensation employees would have been a game changer had they been available to us.\n              \n              \n              Since last July we've taken a number of concrete actions to address and resolve the issues as soon as possible. In June Minister Foote announced the opening of satellite offices. We set up Gatineau, Montreal, Shawinigan, Winnipeg, Halifax, and Kingston with more than 200 compensation staff. We've opened a national call centre and created a feedback form for employees. We provided additional training and regularly updated employees and media through messages and briefing. We made a number of technical enhancements to facilitate and automate processing. \n              Finally, we worked closely with Revenue Canada to prepare the 2016 tax filing season and created a liaison unit to answer the questions related to taxes. \n              \n              With these measures, we have made some progress toward stabilizing the pay system.\n              We have been able to reduce the original July 2016 backlog of 82,000 employee cases to approximately 5,500—4,200 of which are complex acting transactions that will be completed in the coming months.\n              As planned, we reached a steady state for parental leave transactions in March and for disability leave in April. Transactions received at the pay centre in both these categories are now processed within 20 days, 95% of the time.\n              In March, we introduced a new enhancement to automate calculations for acting payments.\n              Tax season was a major priority for the department. To date, we have processed approximately 49,000 amended tax slips for employees as we corrected their pay file and processed their overpayments. Employees who receive amended tax slips do not have to refile. Their taxes will be automatically adjusted.\n              \n              There has been some progress but we know that we have so much more to do. Even though we regularly process pay every two weeks for 300,000 employees and we also pay about 50,000 payments in automated overtime, too many employees are still waiting too long for additional payments such as promotions and changes in their files, including transfers. We still hear stories of employees suffering through these delays.\n              To help we are receiving support from departments and agencies to improve our pay processing speed and accuracy. We just launched a boot camp with compensation advisory staff from departments. They will be able to process transactions within their department remotely to support the pay centre. Treasury Board is leading a review of the processes being used across the government to approve and submit pay requests. This change management work remains a key to having a well-functioning pay system.\n              \n              Throughout government, there is a shared desire to serve and support employees, and we will keep taking steps to deliver the best possible pay service. \n              We are pleased to support and work with the recently struck ministerial working group as they take a whole-of-government approach to resolving this situation once and for all.\n              There is recognition that, to ensure employees are paid accurately and on time, and have the experience they deserve, a whole-of-government approach—end to end—is required. This additional oversight will ensure the effective implementation of the necessary measures to get us there.\n              \n              In conclusion, allow me to spend just a moment on our main estimates to support the government in achieving its objectives. \n              We are estimating expenditures of $3.7 billion in 2017-18, a net increase of $824 million from the year before. This increase includes $365 million to repair and maintain federal buildings across Canada to ensure they are healthy and secure workplaces, $106 million for rehabilitation of the Parliament Buildings, $75 million to rehabilitate other major public infrastructure, and $68 million to install an environmentally friendly heating system for federal buildings in the national capital region, and other major greening projects. \n              It also includes $36 million for continuing the remediation of federal contaminated sites, and $22 million to provide federal organizations with the ability to accept electronic payments from Canadians. The remaining $150 million is primarily to address price and volume fluctuation on expenses associated with federal real property.\n              \n              Our departmental plan reflects these main estimates and our efforts to deliver on the government's priorities.\n              Our employees are dedicated professionals who take their responsibilities seriously and continually strive to serve our clients better to the ultimate benefit of all Canadians.\n              \n              \n              Thank you, Madam Chair. We're happy to take the committee's questions."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "219363", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Yasmin Ratansi)", "contribution": "Thank you very much for taking less than your time.\n              Mr. Ron Parker, you have 10 minutes, please."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "220450", "name": "Mr. Ron Parker (President, Shared Services Canada)", "contribution": "Madam Chair, we are pleased to appear before your committee to discuss Shared Services Canada's 2017-2018 main estimates and departmental plan.\n              With me are John Glowacki, Chief Operating Officer, Alain Duplantie, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Assistant Deputy Minister for Corporate Services, and Sarah Paquet, Senior Assistant Deputy Minister of Strategy.\n              \n              Shared Services is mandated to modernize the government's information technology infrastructure. Created in 2011, we deliver email, data centre, network, and workplace technology device services, as well as cyber and IT security services to the departments and agencies across the Government of Canada.\n              Our work supports the digital delivery of programs and services such as employment insurance, pension benefits, and emergency responses. As outlined in our departmental plan, improving the delivery of IT infrastructure services is our top priority. As a recent example, SSC played a leading role earlier this year in managing the cyber-vulnerability related to a software called Apache Struts 2, which became a worldwide problem for government and private sector systems around the beginning of March.\n              \n              Canada was well positioned to respond to this threat thanks to SSC's enterprise-wide security approach. This approach provides a better view of government networks and infrastructure, and therefore the ability to take quick and coordinated action for all departments and agencies that are part or our security perimeter.\n              \n              Ultimately, all systems and services for Canadians remain secure as SSC coordinated with the Treasury Board Secretariat and the Communications Security Establishment to quickly isolate vulnerable systems and ensure the protection of government and citizen data. \n              This fiscal year is an important one for us. With our planned 2017-18 budget of $1.7 billion, we will continue to strengthen cybersecurity and refresh legacy mission-critical IT infrastructure. We will also build on our progress towards achieving our target state. Our goal, for example, is the consolidation of what's now estimated at approximately 700 legacy data centres to seven or fewer enterprise data centres. To date, we have closed more than 90 legacy data centres and opened two enterprise data centres. Construction is under way for a third enterprise centre in Borden, Ontario.\n              SSC's main estimates represent an increase of almost $176 million over last year. This is mostly due to the multi-year funding provided in budget 2016, which we're investing in a number of projects to maintain and replace legacy mission-critical infrastructure, critical IT equipment, and some security investments. \n              \n              SSC is using these funds to replace more than 40,000 out-of-date components, such as older servers, networks and telecommunication systems.\n              This includes upgrades to a number of telephone systems, including six RCMP operational control centres in British Columbia for 911 capability.\n              We have also replaced 3,000 BlackBerry devices for Global Affairs Canada to ensure secure and reliable mobile communications at missions abroad. \n              \n              Today many of the government's infrastructure components are reaching the end of their life cycles, and some are no longer supported by vendors. Our work in maintaining legacy equipment is therefore vital to keeping the operations of the government running smoothly to ensure continuity of services to Canadians. \n              Shared Services Canada also secures the integrity of the network systems and information. As I discussed earlier, the security we provide is a clear advantage for the Government of Canada. It did not exist before SSC.\n              \n              Our cybersecurity efforts were supported by Budget 2016 funding of $77 million over five years. Our department collaborates closely with other agencies, such as the Communications Security Establishment, in putting in place security controls.\n              \n              \n              This work includes maintaining the integrity of the IT supply chain. To date, Shared Services Canada has performed more than 17,000 supply chain assessments and will continue to incorporate security controls for all of our procurements.\n              On procurement, I would like to mention that budget 2017 included proposed legislative amendments to make the delivery of IT goods and services simpler, easier, and faster. The proposed changes would amend the Shared Services Canada Act and were part of the budget implementation act.\n              This would allow the minister responsible for Shared Services Canada to delegate the purchase of certain items, such as workplace technology devices, directly from vendors through SSC's contracting vehicles. SSC will continue to set up IT contracts and ensure economies of scale. As well, we will continue to perform the supply chain integrity assessments to ensure only trusted equipment, software, or services are used in the delivery of services. \n              We welcome these changes as they will provide better service to our customers while ensuring value for money in enterprise security using our procurement tools. \n              \n              This coming year, we will update the Government of Canada IT infrastructure plan to modernize IT infrastructure and government-wide cyber and Internet security.\n              \n              The updated IT plan will reflect lessons learned from SSC's early experience as well as the broad-based consultations we held last year with SSC employees and other federal public servants, Canadians, and industry. Overall, we received more than 2,500 submissions from stakeholders. The updated plan will also reflect the views of parliamentarians, the Auditor General, and the independent panel of experts commissioned by the Treasury Board Secretariat. \n              Once the plan is considered by ministers, it will be our road map for the subsequent three years. It will include timelines for moving to a simpler, smarter, and more secure government-wide platform.\n              \n              We have already taken action on some of the recommendations.\n              For example, we have developed a service management strategy to deliver service excellence and improve the planning, costing and delivery of our services to customers and Canadians.\n              \n              As part of this, we survey chief information officers every month, asking them questions on five key areas: timeliness, ease of access, positive outcome, process aspects, and engagement experience. This past March, we scored 3.2 out of 5, up from 2.71 in July 2016, and the highest we've scored to date. This is an important achievement, reflecting the heroic efforts of our employees. We must continue, because there is still a lot to do.\n              We are also in the process of renewing all business arrangements with our customers. These arrangements clearly identify the IT services and support we provide, as well as our service performance standards. They are a key part of our commitment to quality service delivery. \n              We're also increasing the agility of government IT. This includes completing a collaborative procurement process to establish standard and secure access to commercially available cloud services for unclassified data for all of our customers. Among their many benefits, cloud services will permit easier and faster access to compute and storage services. They will also allow government workers to be more innovative in how they offer services to Canadians. \n              Much remains to be done to modernize government IT, but we are making steady and important progress. We are also proud of the partnerships we have established with our customers and what we've achieved together. \n              \n              Madam Chair, this concludes my remarks. We would be pleased to take the committee's questions."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "219363", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Yasmin Ratansi)", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              As a reminder to the committee, as indicated on your notice, we'll have 10 minutes for committee business after, so we'll have to schedule those 10 minutes. \n              We'll start off with the first round of questions. \n              Mr. Peterson, you have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson (Newmarket—Aurora, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you, Madam Chair.\n              Good morning to our witnesses. Thank you for your presentations.\n              I have a few questions. I will start with Ms. Lemay.\n              \n              \n              It's probably not a shock, but I have some questions about the pay problems that you've discussed. As members of the committee and members of Parliament, we've all heard from our constituents and from federal employees who are having some issues with getting pay or receiving the benefits they're entitled to. I know it comes as no surprise to you, Madam Lemay. \n              I know I speak for all the Liberals, and I probably speak for all members, that as members of Parliament we obviously find it unacceptable, and we know we have to work towards solutions. \n              I want to step back. You mentioned some information that was new to me. I'm relatively new to this committee, so I wasn't around last summer and last spring when you also made some presentations. I want to focus on some of the staffing and HR issues that you brought up. \n              In your comments, Madam Lemay, I think you indicated that 700 personnel were terminated prior to the implementation of the new system. Is that correct?"}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "223392", "name": "Ms. Marie Lemay", "contribution": "If you'll allow me, I can give you a bit of background on this.\n              The project was actually two projects that were happening at the same time. Phoenix is the technology—the modernization. All departments have access to Phoenix, and the pay is paid through Phoenix. \n              There was a concurrent project called “consolidation of pay”. The idea was to be able to service, through compensation advisers, a number of departments together. In this project, 46 departments were originally targeted to have all their compensation advisers in one pay centre under PSPC at Miramichi. For those 46 departments there is actually a diminution of the equivalent of 700 compensation staff, from about 1,250 to 550. \n              The 55 other departments that are not serviced by the pay centre, but are using Phoenix, kept their compensation advisers. The consolidation was a further phase that did not take place, so they still have the same number of compensation advisers. That's important because, as you know and we know, it's a major transformation. What you're hearing from your constituents, we're hearing, and it is unacceptable. \n              It is a unique—and probably the most complex—transformation. There were expectations that with technology like that you would have some things that would happen in getting used to it, and you would need some transition time. The problem is that we had absolutely no resiliency in the system to be able to manage or compensate for some of these things as we were doing the transition, so if we had had those 700 people and kept them maybe another year, for example, I'm convinced that you wouldn't be hearing what you're hearing today. We would be able to service the employees, and we'd be able to process more transactions. \n              We would still be working through some issues as we implement the system. That would happen, and I'm not saying that all the issues the employees are facing are due to the capacity, but I think the reason you're hearing about the majority of these issues is that we're not able to process fast enough what I'll call the change orders. \n              Every two weeks we run the pay for 300,000 people, but on any day an employee in the public service has either an acting or a termination, they're going on leave, or they're hired. All of these change orders need a compensation adviser to work on them. That's the capacity we don't have right now. It's taking so long and it's creating a ripple effect, which is absolutely unacceptable."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Who made the decision to pull these full-time equivalents out of the system? I just can't understand it. You see a brand new system being implemented that is going to be massive. It's going to require a lot of training, and it's going to require skilled personnel, and just on the eve of implementation, a decision is made to get rid of 700 people. I don't understand the logic behind that decision."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "223392", "name": "Ms. Marie Lemay", "contribution": "I joined the department on April 11, so just after the first wave of implementation. \n              Hindsight is always 20/20, for one. \n              The other thing is that we will have answers to your questions, because there are a number of studies happening right now. There is one that's being done on the lessons learned. I'm not sure that originally—a few years back when it was planned—all the stars were going to align this way, but at the end of the day we might see that the two projects were working in parallel. The compensation advisers were actually notified. It was almost a 22-month process to tell people that their job was going to be affected. This was already enclenché, so there was pressure at the end to roll out, because people had already been told to look for something else or had already moved to other jobs. \n              There were a number of factors, but they will be part of the lessons learned, absolutely."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              Also in your presentation this morning, you said that your department underestimated the learning curve.

There is not one thing. You will see a number of things add up, and it's going to be that accumulation.\n              The reason I'm focusing on the capacity is that extra capacity would have mitigated some of this as we were going through the transition, but I believe we did not plan for the impact it would have on the change in even how you do HR in departments. It's change management. Even in common HR processes, the implication of what you enter into HR is directly related to pay now. It's much more than Phoenix and the pay centre. It's Government of Canada end-to-end in each department, and how you handle the different issues and managers having to approve. \n              It's a question of change management in how we deal with HR, and we truly underestimated that."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Thank you."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "219363", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Yasmin Ratansi)", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              We now go to Mr. McCauley for seven minutes."}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "217981", "name": "Mr. Kelly McCauley (Edmonton West, CPC)", "contribution": "Welcome back, everyone.

One of the more interesting ones we found was a report that stated that before you would go live, the backlog had to be cleared by December 15. I can't recall but I think the report came out a couple of months before that.

Phoenix has received considerable attention thus far, both in Parliament and in the media. An entire process is in place to manage the problem and help someone if they have not been paid.

In terms of capacity, I would say that resources play a huge role. If we could have more staff right now, it would make a difference. Since June, we have basically been holding up a sign that says, “We are hiring”. Our doors are open to any compensation officers who would like to come work for us. The unions have put out calls, but this expertise is rarer than it used to be. We are exploring all options, including training new people.

At the end of the day, however, every government is responsible for its own actions.\n              I want to talk about the structure around the implementation of Phoenix. If it wasn't ready, why, then, did the minister make the decision, on February 24, 2016, to go ahead with the rollout, when she hadn't seen the reports? It is, after all, rather incredible that the minister shirked her ministerial responsibility.

The Liberal government has to answer for this, because it made the decision to go ahead with the rollout of Phoenix, not the Conservatives.\n              Why, then, Ms. Lemay, despite all your information, did the minister give the green light on February 24, 2016?"}, {"turn": 92, "speakerID": "223392", "name": "Ms. Marie Lemay", "contribution": "I will repeat what I said before.

On the contrary, some 250 employees were laid off during the first waves. I'm glad you confirmed that figure.\n              What's more, you said the desperate situation of the Drouin family in Montreal was unfortunate. The parallel I drew with the floods is very apropos. Under such circumstances, people shouldn't be expected to come to us for help; we should be the ones offering them help. Members of the military were deployed, and the Prime Minister went to the flood zone. Mr. Couillard has also been on the ground for at least 10 days. Members have been to the area as well.

You don't mention linguistic management and services as being on the decreased list, and I'm just curious as to why.

It's unclear, though, when we look at these documents how much of the money in each category goes towards maintaining current service, and how much of it is going to transferring and transforming departments into enterprise-wide solutions, which is for cloud computing solutions, both of which are principles under the new government-wide strategic plan.\n              Could you give us some sense of how much time and effort is being spent on managing the systems as they exist, and how much time and effort is being spent transitioning different departments off their legacy systems to enterprise-wide systems?"}, {"turn": 236, "speakerID": "220450", "name": "Mr. Ron Parker", "contribution": "The vast majority of the funding that we receive is allocated to sustaining the current systems. Over the years, we have reallocated from transformation activities to enable the sustainment of the legacy systems, given the state that they were in at our creation.\n              I don't have the precise numbers, but we do have the split between what I would call the ongoing sustainment of the existing system versus how much we are investing in modernization projects.\n              Madam Chair, I would be happy to provide that information."}, {"turn": 237, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "That would be wonderful to see. It would give us just a sense of it so that we can have the confidence—and so Canadians can have the confidence—that we're devoting sufficient resources both to managing the services they receive and also to modernizing government, which is one of your goals and one of the principles laid out in the strategic plan.\n              Another one is moving to cloud computing. At the same time, we see that one of the strategic goals is security. Will there be a preference for creating our own cloud within our data centres so that services will be delivered within our own private cloud, or is the preference toward accessing a more public cloud with cloud services offered by third parties?"}, {"turn": 238, "speakerID": "220450", "name": "Mr. Ron Parker", "contribution": "Madam Chair, Mr. Glowacki will respond to this question."}, {"turn": 239, "speakerID": "220499", "name": "Mr. John Glowacki Jr. (Chief Operating Officer, Shared Services Canada)", "contribution": "Thank you for the question.\n              Madam Chair, this is a complex environment. There is not a simple, clean answer, and it's quite dependent on the demand, on the needs of our customers.\n              Our initial foray into the cloud space is in the unclassified space. It's a convenient place for us to learn. It does not put the government's information at risk.\n              We need to look at these on a case-by-case basis, and that's what we intend to do. We will always look at it with this being the baseline: what is it for the government to do it for itself and then what are the options available to us? In certain cases, the sensitivity of the information drives us to say that we need to do this in-house to protect it. In other cases, such as the Library and Archives Canada example, where we're trying to promote Canadian culture, that's a very good environment to put on the cloud. We want the Googles and the Microsofts of the world to put this all over the planet, because it helps to promote the culture. In other cases, we have to be a bit more concerned about privacy or protection of intellectual property, etc., so we have to take a look.\n              You end up with a hybrid and a spectrum of offerings, and that's what we intend to become experts at, becoming brokers of services."}, {"turn": 240, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "We appreciate that this is a fluid environment. It's good to hear that you're growing some expertise in-house. Do you have any major contractors we should be aware of that you're currently using and that vet and provide or train your in-house IT folks in access to cloud services? Are there any major contracts with those types of outsourced organizations?"}, {"turn": 241, "speakerID": "220499", "name": "Mr. John Glowacki Jr.", "contribution": "We do not rely on any outsourcers to tell us how to do this. We do rely on various advisers. I don't want to start picking out specific companies. It would sound like we're promoting them. You could go to the typical third party industry analysts. We go to them for advice. We also take a look at what other countries have done, and for those of us with private sector experience, what we have done and what we've seen other companies do as well."}, {"turn": 242, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "Mr. Parker mentioned his management plan and service levels.

Inherently, you're buying something that's relatively a commodity service, and it's dependent on them using their service levels, as opposed to us trying to skew them to something else."}, {"turn": 244, "speakerID": "219363", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Yasmin Ratansi)", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              Mr. McCauley, you have a brief one minute."}, {"turn": 245, "speakerID": "217981", "name": "Mr. Kelly McCauley", "contribution": "I'm letting you off the hook.\n              This is to enter notice of a motion that the meeting of June 15, 2017, be dedicated to develop a work plan for the committee's study of the government's procurement process, which includes the vessels for the Canadian Coast Guard, the national shipbuilding procurement strategy, and the proposed acquisition of 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets.\n              Thank you for your indulgence."}, {"turn": 246, "speakerID": "219363", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Yasmin Ratansi)", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              The meeting is suspended.
