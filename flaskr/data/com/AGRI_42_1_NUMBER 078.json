We are continuing our study on climate change and water and soil conservation issues.\n              This morning, we welcome two representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Dr. Brian Gray, Assistant Deputy Minister, Science and Technology Branch, and Mr. Tom Rosser, Assistant Deputy Minister, Strategic Policy Branch.\n              You each have 10 minutes for your presentations.\n              Mr. Gray, you have the floor."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "211039", "name": "Dr. Brian Gray (Assistant Deputy Minister, Science and Technology Branch, Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food)", "contribution": "Thank you. My name is Brian Gray, and I am the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Science and Technology Branch at the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.\n              On page 2 of the document you were given, you will find an outline of today's presentation. I am going to discuss the role and priorities of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and then I will present an overview of climate change and its impacts on agriculture. Finally, I will provide examples of scientific activities conducted by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to achieve greater resiliency of the agricultural sector to the effects of climate change.\n              \n               Our vision for our department is to drive innovation and ingenuity to build a world-leading agriculture and food economy for the benefit of all Canadians. Our mission is to provide leadership in the growth and development of a competitive, innovative, and sustainable agriculture and agrifood sector.\n              The science and technology branch, which I am responsible for, conducts agricultural research development and knowledge and technology transfer activities to support a competitive, innovative, and sustainable Canadian agriculture and agrifood sector.\n              I have pulled out what I feel are the most important points in our minister's mandate letter related to the topic that you are studying right now, as it relates to my branch, the science and technology branch. First, I point out that the key point is to invest in agricultural research to support discovery science and innovation in the sector. Second is to work with provinces, territories, and other willing partners to help the sector adjust to climate change and better address water and soil conservation and development issues. Finally, we need to support the ministers of Natural Resources and of Environment and Climate Change in making investments that will make our resource sectors world leaders in the use and development of clean and sustainable technology and processes.\n              \n              Let's move on to slide 5. Our branch has 20 research and development centres located across Canada. We have 35 experimental farms that are connected to the research centres. We have three regions: the coastal region, the Prairie region and the Ontario and Quebec region.\n              \n              I will provide a quick overview of climate change impacts on agriculture. Climate change will bring, quite simply, longer growing seasons, due to temperature, but also more variable precipitation, resulting in more drought and also in more flooding. We'll see more extreme events. Warmer temperatures will produce more pests and disease outbreaks, and make Canada more vulnerable to invasive alien species. These are invasive species that might not have the suitable conditions to live in Canada yet, but that, with the changing climate, will. Finally, land suitability for spring-seeded small grain crops will increase, particularly in western Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. In summary, I would say that with the changing climate, we have challenges as well as opportunities in agriculture.\n              Globally, agriculture represents between 10% and 15% of the total anthropogenic—that is, caused by human activity—greenhouse gas emissions. In Canada, it's approximately 10% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.\n              In addition to our own research, which I'll be talking about briefly today, we also have our department's agricultural greenhouse gases program, which provides $27 million over five years to Canadian universities and non-profit organizations for the research, development, and technology transfer of ways to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's agricultural sector.\n              \n              \n              Let's move on to slide 9, which outlines agricultural drivers and challenges related to climate change.\n              There are two key points. The first involves adapting agricultural production to climate change while being involved in its mitigation. This implies adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses; reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and supporting the development and use of clean technologies contributing to long-term, low carbon economic growth.\n              The second key point consists in conserving environmental resources and services while increasing agricultural production. The increasing world population stimulates demand for more food. Here we are talking about soil conservation, water and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and sustainable intensification.\n              I will now provide a few examples of AAFC scientific activities. This is slide 10.\n              \n               Moving on to page 11, here is one example of a collection of science. When we talk about beneficial management practices, one of the stellar examples is moving to no-till. I understand the Soil Conservation Council was here Tuesday. They would have given you quite an update on that. With that, in the west came the reduction of summer fallow. Over the period from 1951 to 2013, the net carbon sink or storage that we were able to achieve because of that change in practice, that beneficial management practice, was about 11 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This offsets about 15% of the agricultural GHG emissions.\n              The point I'd like to make is that it wasn't one or two studies. It was a series of hundreds of studies conducted over decades, not only by our department but by our partners, academia, the provinces, and our colleagues in other countries, most notably the U.S. and the USDA. Research very rarely leads from one study to a beneficial management practice. It takes a fair bit of time.\n              With the next couple of slides, I'd like to talk about extreme weather events.\n              In our branch we develop new varieties of crops. We develop new varieties of crops in areas where there is the public good space. That is, there's not an industry that's developing that variety, so it is something we do for the public good and for the benefit of our producers. An example is potatoes. At our Fredericton Research and Development Centre, we are developing varieties of drought tolerant potatoes. This is just a very quick illustration of how that's done. We're doing several crosses in the hope of eventually developing a variety that is more drought tolerant.\n              Next is an example of where we have too much water. In a changing climate, you'll see that we will have drought, but we'll also have periods of more intense rain. We've already seen that across Canada in the past growing season. Barley is a particular cereal that doesn't do well in inundation. Normal varieties that we have now can't last more than a couple of days being inundated with water. At the Brandon Research and Development Centre, we are developing inundation tolerant barley. On the right you can see the two varieties: the sensitive one, which is the more normal one, and the one that we're developing. It's kind of a neat project. We have mini rice fields at the research centre. We flood them and that variety on the left is now tolerant up to 10 days. \n              The final example I'll give you is from the agro-climate, geomatics and earth observations division within our branch. They develop tools that are available to farmers and the public. They look at current climate conditions and future projected conditions given to us by Environment and Climate Change Canada or other members of the IPCC.\n              If you look at the illustration of the maps, the current weather temperature conditions are on the left. If you look at the right, there's a change of 3°C. You can see that this change of heat will make it a lot more attractive for these three examples of pests. What do we do with that? This informs our scientists to develop new varieties of crops that would be resistant to these types of pests, to develop beneficial management practices that would help the system be more resilient to the pests, and finally to search out natural predators to these sorts of pests.\n              The next slide, I apologize, is a bit busy. It's a work in progress, as are the living laboratories. I will try to explain it very quickly. \n              \n               It's an adaptive management approach with the goal of improved agro-environmental performance and sustainable intensification. It's the use of multidisciplinary teams of scientists working together with producers, designing and experimenting with new, potential beneficial management practices on real working farms. These beneficial management practices would be different than the suite we have now because we'd be looking for multiple benefits. Beneficial management practices not only help in climate change adaptation but also mitigation, biodiversity, and water and soil conservation and protection.\n              We've been working with the USDA in the United States, with their science division, which is comparable to ours. We had several workshops leading up to one in January. They're quite supportive on this approach and we're going to look at collaborating over the coming years.\n              \n              At slide 16, entitled “Looking Ahead”, you can see that the Canadian government is investing in agricultural science inside and outside of AAFC. Improving partnerships is integral to our approach, be it with the provinces, the sector or academia, through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, with other federal departments and agencies and with international organizations to leverage benefits for Canada.\n              AAFC is well positioned to collaborate across the agricultural science and innovation ecosystem to support the sector's resiliency to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.\n              \n              Thanks. That's it for me. I'll turn it over to Tom."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Can you do it in four or five minutes?"}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "232752", "name": "Mr. Tom Rosser (Assistant Deputy Minister, Strategic Policy Branch, Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, I will try to go as quickly as possible.\n              \n              I'll add a couple of thoughts to what my colleague has said."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Take your time.

The current framework, known as Growing Forward 2, will expire on March 31, 2018. It will be succeeded by the CAP, the Canadian agricultural partnership.\n              Mr. Chair, I think members of the committee will be aware that when federal-provincial-territorial ministers of agriculture met in St. John's, Newfoundland this summer, agreement in principle was reached on what's known as a multilateral framework agreement, which is the basis of the framework. We've taken that agreement in principle and have been working over the past several months to operationalize it to give it legal effect and also, underneath the multilateral framework, to negotiate bilateral agreements with each of the provinces and territories. \n              Federal-provincial-territorial ministers of agriculture have identified environmental sustainability and climate change as one of six CAP priorities. Building on the efforts of past policy frameworks, the Government of Canada, together with provinces and territories, will provide funding to help the sector grow sustainably by reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions; protecting the environment, including soil and water; and adapting to climate change.\n              Brian shared with you some examples of research that we have conducted within the department and will continue to conduct under CAP to advance those efforts. I'd just like to touch briefly on some of the programs that we have to try to give effect to that research and innovation and transfer some of the knowledge that's generated. \n              An important element of the CAP is what are known as the business risk management programs, or BRM programs. These are a suite of cost-shared programs that are intended to help farmers deal with risks, market risks or other risks, beyond their control. Under the Growing Forward 2 framework, we anticipate that total expenditures under that program for a five-year period will be in the range of about $6 billion. \n              I won't talk in detail to each of the programs within that suite, but I would like to just highlight a couple that I think are particularly relevant to the work of this committee with respect to climate change. \n              There is the AgriInsurance program, which is the largest. It represents about two-thirds of total expenditures under the BRM suite of programs. It's a crop insurance program that's actuarially sound and self-sustainable, meaning that the premiums collected are based on historical farmer losses and, therefore, that the program is well placed to continue to help farmers remain resilient in the face of extreme weather events. \n              Occasionally when disasters strike, and the sector incurs extraordinary costs to recover, the AgriRecovery framework can be applied to develop specific programming to help producers with these unforeseen extraordinary costs. An example of where this has been done is in Nova Scotia after an unusually heavy, “once in a hundred years” snowfall in the winter of 2014-15. AgriRecovery was used to help maple syrup producers recover from damages suffered during that winter. More recently, an AgriRecovery response is being implemented for damage caused by the wildfires in British Columbia this summer. Support is being made available to help with the extraordinary costs related to feed loss, livestock mortality, farm infrastructure loss, and other damages caused to farmers. \n              The only other program I'd like to highlight in the BRM suite are the AgriRisk initiatives, which support research development and the implementation of new risk management tools. \n              In addition to the BRM suite, the CAP will have a series of cost-shared programs that are usually delivered by provinces and territories but financially supported by the federal government. On farm environment cost-shared programs, it will deliver the practices and technologies developed through innovation programming that Brian described earlier. Provinces and territories design and manage delivery of these programs, and this allows programs to be tailored to each jurisdiction's environmental priorities. These programs build producer awareness and knowledge of environmental risks on their farms, and based on these risk assessments, provide financial incentives to producers to adopt innovative, beneficial management practices to reduce these risks, including climate risks. \n              \n               Canadian producers have adopted technologies and practices that both build resilience to climate change and reduce GHG emissions by improving production efficiency and increasing agricultural soil carbon. In particular, there is a lot of interest in the sector now in precision agricultural technologies, for example, which, among other things, can allow producers to reduce and better target the use of fertilizers and other inputs, and improve the efficiency of their operations while reducing their climate and environmental footprint.\n              \n              I will briefly discuss some measures that are complementary to the previously described Canadian Agricultural Partnership initiatives, to present the government's objectives to mitigate the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector.\n              In Budget 2017, an amount of $70 million was allocated over six years to further support agricultural discovery science and innovation, with a focus on addressing emerging priorities such as climate change and soil and water conservation. Budget 2017 also included an amount of $200 million over four years for innovative, clean technologies for Canada's natural resource sectors, including agriculture.\n              Agriculture-specific funding will address key barriers to the development and adoption of clean technology in the agriculture sector. For instance, the funding will serve to produce advanced materials and bioproducts based on agricultural outputs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural operations through improved land management and energy efficiency.\n              I know that the committee recently conducted a study on A Food Policy for Canada. The department has just completed a consultation process on that policy. The environment is one of the four themes of the food policy for Canada. During consultations, stakeholders across the country raised food waste and its associated greenhouse gas emissions as a priority for A Food Policy for Canada. We estimate that the value of food waste in Canada is approximately $30 billion a year. This represents 3% of greenhouse gas emissions across Canada.\n              Through the adoption of innovative practices and technologies, the agriculture sector has made important advances in increasing efficiencies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving soil and water, and building resilience to a changing climate.\n              The sector is proactively working to meet growing demands to demonstrate sustainability. For example, the Canadian Round Table for Sustainable Beef, the Canadian Round Table for Sustainable Crops and the Dairy Farmers of Canada proAction Initiative, are all working to advance the continuous improvement of the Canadian agricultural value chains, including in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n              Through CAP and other complementary funding, the federal government, in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments, will support industry efforts to enhance the sustainability of the Canadian agricultural sector."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Rosser.\n              You said that when food waste is disposed of or buried, greenhouse gases are released.

In short, we are going to discuss many topics during our meetings for this study.\n              Mr. Gray, you raised a point that is quite clear in your document. There are a lot of questions being asked about how to face climate change and its effects on soil, and how farmers will react. You mentioned that there are opportunities, but that there are also challenges to be met. Temperature variations are among these challenges, and we are going to have to adapt crops to this new reality.\n              You spoke a lot about genetically modified products. What is the status of research on genetically modified products at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada?

The work we do in our breeding is not GMO as defined by most groups. I don't have the definition off the top of my head, but I can tell you what we do. In an organism, there is the genome, which is the entire sequence of the DNA. It's the entire genetic code of the organism, and what we've been able to do in the scientific community with our genomics people is to look for markers, meaning the genes or usually a series of base codes on the long strand of DNA marking an association with a trait that we're looking for. The trait could be resilience to drought or resilience to flooding or resilience to a fungus or whatever, and that trait, for whatever reason, is not expressed. There are ways of using viruses to express the DNA that's already in the naturally occurring plant. By doing that, we are able to express the gene that has been suppressed. \n              Generally I would consider GMO as something that takes DNA from a different type of organism and puts it into another. This is not that. You're dealing with the existing strand of DNA. By doing that, we are able to speed up the selection process for plants by half, so it will take half as long to get the varieties we want."}, {"turn": 16, "speakerID": "234628", "name": "Mr. Luc Berthold", "contribution": "I am happy to hear that clarification, because your document says “cross-pollinate drought tolerant germplasm”.

One that sticks in my mind is the use of genetics to develop root structures that go deeper into the soil to return carbon deeper into the soil, and developing the genetics around root architecture so that our soil has a chance to get the carbon replaced.

At those conferences, they meet people with neat ideas they hadn't thought of, and they get together and then they talk about collaborating on new science. In that general process our scientists have come across Environment and Climate Change Canada's scientists, and they were collaborating. \n              Before I answer it completely, I don't want to leave the impression that nothing was happening, but given this government's mandate, given our minister's mandate letter, we needed to formalize it. So at my level, with Environment and Climate Change Canada, we formalized an MOU, which we both signed, and we have a work plan. In that work plan, I'd say a third of it is something that staff were already doing, but we have new areas that we're going to grow into. This is using existing monies. This is not an opportunity to grab more money. It's just that in these areas where we're working, we can collaborate better.

Not only is it an important opportunity from an environmental standpoint, but also economically. The most recent data from Statistics Canada suggests that the non-traditional bioeconomy, both forestry and feedstock-based agriculture is a $4.3-million industry in Canada and employs thousands of people.

We believe we can better target our resources in our negotiations with the provinces and territories, and that we can better use existing resources to advance environmental objectives.\n              As I mentioned in the beginning, in addition to our planned spending with the provinces and territories in the context of the framework, there are several complementary initiatives, such as investments in clean technology, for instance.

In my opinion, the farmers do a remarkable job. When we talk about climate change, we have to remember that they too are a part of the solution. They make a lot of efforts to improve their environment, and they have a lot to teach us, in fact. \n              This summer, when I visited vegetable producers, I had the opportunity to speak with organic farmers about the problems caused by insects. You spoke about this in your presentation earlier, in fact. Global warming is causing a proliferation of insect pests, on organic and other farms, and they are a serious issue.\n              Has the department taken global warming and its impacts into account in the implementation of the next framework?

Because of high-sequencing machines, we can now get the information on the genomics of an individual plant or virus, for example, about 1,000 times faster than we could five years ago. Actually, the sequencing is faster than Moore's Law, so our problem will be that we're running out of capability to analyze or store it.\n              The area that's really interesting, and it touches on your question about organic farming, is the soil microbiome. The microbiome is the bacteria, the fungi, and the viruses that are living in that soil. I can't remember off the top of my head, but something to the effect of a teaspoon of soil would have over a million organisms in it, and those million organisms might be represented by a thousand species. Until we were able to develop high-sequence genomics, we couldn't know that. We don't know what the perfect soil is for a particular soil type or region, but we're going to get there some day.

We can actually reduce some of the CO2 in the atmosphere through the sinks.\n              Also, as I mentioned, the way we apply nutrients to the soil is very important, because nitrous oxide is a molecule that's released when you have too many nutrients in the soil. It's released through microbiome breakdown of different molecules. One molecule of nitrous oxide is equivalent to 298 molecules of CO2, so it's a big deal. If we can look at changing the microbiome and changing the way we apply fertilizers, we can reduce that heavily.\n              Methane is another one, which is from dairy cattle and mainly beef cattle. The digestive process gives off gases. It's significant. We can reduce that. We're working on science to reduce that. You can do it through genetics, through breeding. There are cows that are naturally more efficient with food. You can also do it through diet. We've been successful in developing lines of beef cattle and diets for dairy cattle through which we're actually reducing the GHG emissions of an animal per litre of milk or per pound of beef depending on the animal.\n              Those are two or three examples specifically in areas that we're working on now."}, {"turn": 67, "speakerID": "232752", "name": "Mr. Tom Rosser", "contribution": "I'll add that from a programmatic perspective, we take some of the things we learn from our science and try to operationalize them in individual producers' farms, and through our cost-shared programming with provinces, we'll support the development of what are called “environmental farm plans” whereby an assessment will be made of where there are opportunities to improve the environmental performance of a farm.\n              Also, we have what are called BMPs, beneficial management practices, if I remember correctly, whereby we can provide incentives to actually put in place some of the recommendations that come out of those audits.

The numbers here for western farmers is likely around $3,700 a year, and for eastern farmers, $2,400 a year. Those numbers are a concern.

It was done before the pan-Canadian framework was negotiated and, therefore, didn't incorporate some of the features of the framework, such as the exemption for on-farm fuel use, which is part of the emissions pricing system in British Columbia and in the federal legislation. So there have been changes and developments since then.\n              First of all, one of the bigger conclusions of the analysis was that even at a $50-a-tonne carbon price, the impacts in percentage terms on producers were relatively muted. My recollection is that they're in the neighbourhood of 1% or 2%.

The government is in the midst of extensive consultations and is receiving numerous requests regarding the food guide. We are being told that this committee isn't the right forum to discuss the food guide and that it's a Health Canada matter. We are the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, though. We have to stop being afraid to talk about issues that affect the people who feed Canadians.\n              The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is of great interest to Canada. It is important not only for trade, but also for grain, dairy, beef, and poultry producers. It's a deal that matters tremendously to all the Canadian farmers and processors we represent. They want access to that market, which, as we all know, is vast. That is all the more important given today's news that India is imposing new 50% tariffs, a devastating blow to Canada's agricultural industry.\n              We mustn't close our eyes. We have to listen to our producers and give them the opportunity to be heard. The very role of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food is to give Canadian producers the chance to speak to the members of Parliament on the committee. In each of our parties, we were chosen by the people to represent their interests on this committee. We should hear what they have to say and include their recommendations in a report, which would then make its way to our parliamentary colleagues, including the ministers responsible for trade negotiations, international trade, and global affairs.\n              Unfortunately, we learned that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will not even be at the TPP talks next week. As far as I know, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food under the previous Conservative government always took part in those talks.\n              It's important that our committee send a clear message to Parliament and the government: agriculture must figure prominently in the negotiations. We cannot behave as though products come ready-made and ready to go. Our involvement is all the more essential given that, according to its most recent budget, the government intends to significantly expand Canada's agricultural production in the coming years. The objectives are ambitious, and one way to achieve them is for producers to have access to new markets.\n              We do, however, have to overcome a major TPP challenge: a key player has backed out. The negotiations that took place involved 12 countries originally and no longer necessarily apply to a TPP deal between 11 countries. The concessions that were made in the context of a 12-country TPP may not apply to the negotiations for an 11-country TPP. If the committee does not seize this opportunity for Canadian farmers to have their say, I can't see who in Parliament will.\n              That is why I urge my fellow members to think seriously about allowing the committee to discuss the TPP as soon as possible and to hear what producers and members of the agrifood industry have to say about it.\n              I haven't been on the committee for the past two years, but I believe it has already looked at the issue of the TPP.

For us to say that we are not going to discuss it because it's not on our agenda that we discussed a couple of weeks ago.... This is critical.\n              Moving forward, what is the message? Is it that if any other critical issue comes up that will impact Canadian agriculture, if it's not something we put on our agenda months ago, it's not worth talking about? That's not the message I want to send to our stakeholders across the country, that “I'm sorry, this is something that's going to impact your livelihood, but it's not something that we have on our agenda for the next couple of weeks and it's not something that I want to take 10 minutes out of a two-hour committee meeting to discuss, because I don't think it's worthwhile.”\n              I want to leave that with you.

Those are industry-led research and development clusters of dairy, beef, pork, and pulses. Those are examples of big ones. Within that, there are opportunities for industry to tell us the big things they need developed and what they need answers to. Those are complemented by the science that our branch does, which is further upstream, longer term, more risky, more foundational, and with longer periods for getting answers to questions. We collaborate together on those. \n              As I mentioned earlier, we're not in a position to talk about the next one.

We've evolved through the policy frameworks based on their input and on evaluations by our internal evaluation program. Again, I can't speak to the details on funding, but in the current policy framework, there's a fair bit of money that goes out to industry that has to be matched by industry for big clusters and then for smaller research projects. \n              When it's appropriate for us to talk about the Canadian agricultural partnership in more detail, I would be happy to do so."}, {"turn": 104, "speakerID": "232752", "name": "Mr. Tom Rosser", "contribution": "I might just add briefly, from a policy standpoint, that emissions from the agricultural industry are fairly significant and contribute to the national total roughly 10%, I believe.

We have some incentive programs to help them effect changes. There are tools in place, and they've proven to effective over time at reducing the emissions intensity of the agricultural sector.

Over the past few weeks and months, we have witnessed instances where newly developed policies met with unintended consequences a few weeks later.

We think it will capture carbon, but how much will it capture? In the process of capturing carbon, it's also building the microbiome in the soil at the same time. \n              That's something that we need to do.

I think it's important that we remember whom we work for, that we work for our stakeholders and constituents, not necessarily government officials. I just want to make sure that's clear out there, who our priorities are on here today.\n              Dr. Gray, could you answer the following for me? I'm from western Canada, and maybe we're a little bit different. Our parcels are bigger and whatnot. One of our witnesses earlier said that two-thirds of farmers in eastern Canada are still tilling, that they haven't accepted no till.\n              Tom, you're shaking your head. Maybe Mr. Rosser is better to respond to this, but what is the reason for that insistence on continuing with those types of practices when we've seen the benefits of no till, not only on the cost of the operation, but also the environmental impact, the moisture in the soil, and those kinds of things? Is it an educational issue, or is there something we're not doing that we could be doing to try to encourage that no-till practice?"}, {"turn": 133, "speakerID": "211039", "name": "Dr. Brian Gray", "contribution": "Thank you for the question. I'm not an expert to answer this. I can give you a broad response.\n              Yes, there's room for improvement in eastern Canada, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that all of the land being tilled can go to zero till. It's complicated. There are areas that are too wet. There are areas where the soil, quite frankly, is too heavy. There are areas where we don't have the perfect tool of zero till.\n              However, as I imagine your witnesses on Tuesday would have said, there's lots of room for improvement. Generally speaking, the farms are much bigger in western Canada and it's easier to recapitalize. When you go from a plow-disc cultivated system to a zero-till one, you have to buy new equipment that's very expensive. It's generally easier to buy that equipment when you're already working on a large scale. That's my simple response, but we could have people come back to give you more information on the specifics."}, {"turn": 134, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Gray.\n              Thank you, Mr. Barlow and Mr. Berthold.\n              \n              Mr. Poissant, you have the floor for six minutes."}, {"turn": 135, "speakerID": "234535", "name": "Mr. Jean-Claude Poissant (La Prairie, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

Do we have similar maps of how crop production could change in Canada? In the west, we have always been the wheat breadbasket of the world. With the changing growing seasons, there could be an economic change in the types of crops we grow. I know that in Asia a lot of wheat has come off the international market because of the rain that's now happening in parts of Asia, which didn't use to happen.\n              Do we have a larger risk analysis on the economics of climate change in terms of the crops that are produced in Canada, or is there an opportunity there?"}, {"turn": 161, "speakerID": "232752", "name": "Mr. Tom Rosser", "contribution": "Brian may be better placed to answer the question than I.\n              I would just offer two observations, Mr. Chair.

We have seen lower acreage in wheat over time and increased acreage in oil seeds. In part that just reflects market realities; in part it reflects technological advances and the ability to grow certain crops in different climates; and in part it probably reflects changes in growing seasons. I know there has been research done in this area. In fact, you see part of it in the deck that we shared with the committee, some thoughts and analysis of what a changing climate could mean over time.\n              I am not aware of specific analyses that answer your question at a global level, but perhaps Brian can offer some thoughts."}, {"turn": 162, "speakerID": "211039", "name": "Dr. Brian Gray", "contribution": "We have very good information up to last year's crop on most of Canada.

That's where we'd work with Environment and Climate Change Canada because they have one of the world's global climate forecasting models. We'd be looking at regional model development in partnership with them. That is part of our MOU so we can start doing the “what if” scenarios. For example, if the temperature is going to be this, we already have good information on soil so we know it's the right soil and that the temperature is going to change, those sorts of things, so we can start doing the “what ifs”.
