It's a very interesting one today. We have the honour of having the Minister of Agriculture, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, a good maritimer who escaped the snowstorm today with me, here to explain his mandate letter and also to talk about the main estimates. We'll proceed with the minister's presentation. You will have your opening statement, Mr. Minister, and after that we'll go with the question period. Thank you."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.Good afternoon everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm honoured to be here today and I'm joined by my deputy minister, Andrea Lyon; assistant deputy minister, Pierre Corriveau; and assistant deputy minister, Greg Meredith.I congratulate you, Mr. Chair, and all the members, for being selected to this committee. While we all come from different backgrounds, our goal is the same, to build a stronger agriculture food industry in Canada. I am honoured to have been appointed Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. It has been a busy few months on the job building relationships throughout the sector and throughout the country, which is so critical. I've been talking to industry and my provincial and territorial counterparts. I have been speaking to our international partners, including the United States, China, Mexico, and the EU. I look forward to continuing discussions with my colleagues, industry, and Canadians to help improve the agriculture industry in Canada.We are meeting at a time when Canada's agriculture and food sector is in a relatively strong position. Net cash income is expected to hit a new record in 2015 of $15 billion and remain strong for 2016. The farm balance sheet is also strong with a lower ratio of debt compared to assets. Meanwhile, our agriculture and food exports hit a new record of over $60 billion last year, and there are more exciting opportunities for growth to come.The purpose of our meeting today is to look at the government's financial estimates, as well as to outline the key priorities in my mandate letter. The main estimates outline the department's planned spending for the coming fiscal year. The estimates are a snapshot of the department's budget at a point in time. As members know, the department's budget can change over the fiscal year depending on the changing needs and priorities. These changes are reflected in the supplementary estimates.Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2016-17 main estimates total $2.26 billion. The majority of the department's funding supports programs under Growing Forward 2.Mr. Chair, I'd like to give the committee a brief overview of how our investments are building a stronger Canadian agriculture and agrifood industry. Growing Forward 2 is a $3-billion investment over five years to drive a Canadian agriculture and food industry that is innovative, competitive, sustainable, and focused on markets. Of this amount $1 billion is earmarked for federal programs. The balance, $2 billion, is cost-shared funding with the provinces and territories on a 60:40 basis. The provinces and territories use these resources to meet the regional needs of their industries. In addition, this year's main estimates reflect $1.3 billion available for business risk management programs. Our investments under Growing Forward 2 are helping our agriculture and food industry stay on the cutting edge of innovation, marketing, sustainability, and competitiveness. Turning to my priorities, a central one is supporting science and innovation. Science is the core of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. For over 125 years research has helped build a world-class agricultural industry in Canada. I've had the privilege of visiting some of our research centres across the country. It is amazing what our scientists do—helping farmers cut expenses with crops that are resistant to certain diseases and insects, and helping ensure efficient use of inputs such as water and fertilizer, which is good for the environment and for the producer's bottom line.Through investments in science, our government will help the sector stay on the cutting edge. Some examples of recent Growing Forward 2 investments in science include almost $8 million with Saskatchewan for livestock and forage research, and $3.6 million to help cattle producers harness the power of genetics and open up new markets. The main estimates also outline capital investments of over $30 million to boost capacity at our research centres, as well as other improvements to greenhouses and laboratories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInnovation is critical to delivering the government's strong environmental mandate. My mandate includes the environment, helping the sector adjust to the increasing number of issues associated with climate change and addressing water and soil conservation issues.Farmers are already making great progress. We all know Canadian farmers are incredible stewards of the land. A recent study shows that the Canadian cattle industry has reduced its environmental footprint over the past three decades while increasing production by one-third.Growing Forward 2 is also supporting environmental actions on our farms. For instance, we recently joined with Alberta in announcing funding under Growing Forward 2 to support solar power on farms. These kinds of investments will boost Canada's reputation for environmental stewardship at home and abroad.Along with innovation and the environment, another key priority is trade. The government supports trade because it creates good jobs for Canadians and contributes to economic growth. We want to be sure our farmers and processors reap the benefits of the growing world population.In these estimates you will see resources going to help our farmers and food processors grow their markets through investments under agri-marketing programs. In the past few months we have worked hard to open markets for our beef farmers in South Korea, our beef and pork producers in Ukraine, our pork producers in India, our livestock genetics in Georgia, and our beef genetics through our investment of $2.6 million in the Canadian Beef Breeds Council.Our farmers can compete with the best, but they need a level playing field to do so.We took a big step in this direction in December when the United States repealed country-of-origin labelling for beef and pork. I am pleased that the USDA has now officially repealed the legislation. This is positive news for our pork and beef industries.The government also strongly supports supply management. Having worked both in the dairy and potato business, I have a good appreciation of how important supply management and trade are to our farm businesses and to our economy. We will continue to advance all Canadian agricultural interests as we consider trade matters, which include the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The government has committed to hearing from Canadians on TPP before determining whether the Canada will ratify the agreement, and we have committed to a comprehensive debate on the TPP in the House of Commons.I have already been discussing the TPP with farm organizations to get their view. Our message is clear, the Government of Canada fully supports supply management. We understand the importance of compensation to the supply-managed sector should the TPP enter into force. We will continue to engage with farmers on this important issue.Just over half the money budgeted under the main estimates is available for our business risk management programs. Farmers look at government to help them manage risk and recover from the impact of disasters and disease. For example, in January we announced investments to help the tree fruit growers and maple syrup producers in Nova Scotia to recover from weather-related damages.The estimates include an increase of $5 million for agri-risk initiatives. The initiatives are focused on helping to develop new and innovative risk management tools for Canadian farmers.We are also moving forward on improvements to the advance payments program. These changes were requested by farmers and are now in force. They will make the program more user friendly and flexible while covering most commodities.The Prime Minister has asked me to engage with farmers and provincial governments to ensure our business risk management programs are meeting their needs.Before I close, Mr. Chair, I will give the committee a brief look ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t In the coming months I'll be working with the provinces and territories to position the sector for even greater success through the next agricultural framework. We've been listening to farmers, processors, and Canadians. More and more customers around the world are looking for the great products coming from Canada's farmers and food processors. The new framework will help ensure that the industry can meet and benefit from the growing demand. For the longer term, we're also committed to beginning discussions with governments and industry on the direction of food policy in Canada.Mr. Chair, I hope that this has given you a sense of my priorities as minister. To sum up, I want to listen to, work with, and invest in our agricultural industry. Thank you for the opportunity to visit you, and I'm pleased to be here."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Minister, for outlining how this government plans to support and guide agriculture in the future, and for the overall picture of where it is today.We'll start with the questions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Mr. Gourde, you have six minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "218376", "name": "Mr. Jacques Gourde (Lévis—Lotbinière, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.I thank the minister and the deputy ministers for being here. The committee is always pleased to have the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada here.We cannot afford to ignore the problem of diafiltered milk. You are aware of this issue, Minister. Americans are very imaginative and invent products so that they can get them into Canada. This was confirmed by a very large processor at the last meeting of our committee.Diafiltered milk is not used in the United States to make cheese. It was invented so that it could cross the Canadian border. It is a scandal.Minister, we must act and close that border. This product was invented in order to get across the border. No American eats cheese that was made with diafiltered milk, and Canadians should not be eating it either."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon. Lawrence MacAulay", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Mr. Gourde, and I appreciate your question. Basically, I guess I can say that I inherited the issue.Over the last couple of years, there has been an increase in diafiltered milk in this country, and we're certainly aware of the concerns regarding the use of diafiltered milk in the making of cheese. We're looking at an approach that ensures that the cheese compositional standards are clear for everyone. Under the standards, diafiltered milk was never meant to be allowed to be used as milk.Canada recognizes the importance of effective import controls and administers its imports in accordance with the international trade obligations. Milk protein substances, including diafiltered milk, can be imported into Canada under NAFTA, as long as they contain 85% or more milk protein on a dry matter basis.The industry has been engaged in negotiations, and there are differences of opinion on the way forward between some producers and processors, and between some dairy farmers in different provinces. We are working with the industry, and intend on having further discussions on this issue to ensure that the standards are clear.Quite honestly, Mr. Gourde, I understand the problem. As you are aware, there are discussions taking place with the processors and the industry in different provinces. What I am trying to do, and have tried to do since becoming minister, is to make sure that all of the sectors understand the regulations and what standards are required. That is, in fact, what I have done to this date."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "218376", "name": "Mr. Jacques Gourde", "contribution": "Thank you, Minister.I would like to discuss another topic, that of free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement or Canada-European trade agreement.The Canadian meat industry, particularly beef and pork, is very favourable to those agreements. It is very happy that our government managed to conclude agreements last year. However, there is a cloud on the horizon. The matter concerns the consistency of regulations governing slaughterhouses. It seems that certain European countries, or other countries, could use the regulations governing abattoirs to see to it that our meats do not get exported to other countries.Could those regulations possibly be harmonized with those of other countries? Otherwise, our exports may be blocked. A country could say that it agrees to import 60 million tonnes of beef, but it could also refuse our exports by claiming that the rules and standards governing Canadian abattoirs are different from the ones in Europe.Could this jeopardize the ratification of the agreement?"}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon. Lawrence MacAulay", "contribution": "I understand and I've heard your concerns. Of course, as you're no doubt fully aware, my officials are doing their work on an ongoing basis on this plan in order to make sure that we can, as a country, accomplish what we have achieved in the trade deal, and to make sure that the regulations are well understood.Deputy, you could add to that, but that's basically what we do when there are difficulties. There always are, no matter what commodity you're talking about. I think you're fully aware of this, too. Whether it's dairy, grains, oilseeds, or whatever, there are always difficulties with regulations.Sometimes there's agreement on regulations, but as you're fully aware, then something else enters the deal and causes some trade problems. I think it's a problem continually with the countries that are involved in trade deals.Yes, we want to make sure that we work to make sure they're harmonized as well as possible. My officials have been working on this. Perhaps you can add to that, Deputy."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "206773", "name": "Ms. Andrea Lyon (Deputy Minister, Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food)", "contribution": "Thank you for the question.We have exchanged correspondence with European Union representatives concerning the technical barriers relating to meat.

We certainly appreciate the work you're doing to support the growth of the agriculture sector, especially in my riding of Fundy Royal in New Brunswick.Aside from talking with participants in the industry, I also spend quite a bit of time talking to consumers. One of the areas they have brought up to me are concerns with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Those are largely due to some of the stories we've seen in the media.I know that CFIA falls under the Minister of Health, but I'm wondering if you could update the committee on your work with the department to strengthen our inspection levels."}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon. Lawrence MacAulay", "contribution": "Thank you very much. I can assure you that before I came here I dealt with CFIA. Sometimes I had some difficulties with CFIA, being a potato producer and calling them in. Yes, we hear there are difficulties, probably with inspections, and having inspectors available, and getting the certificate if you're wishing to ship, particularly in western Canada, some products across the border.In general, from what I understand, there are basically enough inspectors. The problem is.... I expect that this committee will probably be interviewing some farmers and farm groups. The interesting thing is whether they wish to have CFIA officials available around the clock. If they do, that costs more money. Is that the direction they wish to go in?There are things like that we're going to have to deal with, but we have a CFIA official here, if you wish to elaborate more on that.Basically we had meetings, mostly in eastern Canada, in the last few weeks. CFIA is generally well accepted, but in some areas, having this 24-hour availability for CFIA people is wanted. It's something that I think could be looked at by the committee."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "206356", "name": "Mr. Paul Mayers (Vice-President, Policy and Programs, Canadian Food Inspection Agency)", "contribution": "Thank you, Minister. Thank you for the question.Just briefly, the last time I had the pleasure of being at this committee there was a question with respect to the agency. We did follow up and provided the committee with a reflection of the focus that the agency has placed on front-line inspection in particular, which, you will recall from the information we've provided, has demonstrated quite a significant increase in inspection.We recognize that in the agency, even as we have dealt, as all departments have, with cost containment, the agency has made a very firm commitment to protecting front-line inspection, and the numbers bear that out."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon.

It won't be something that will happen very quickly. It's something that has not been done yet but will be put together by myself and other ministers across the country, and there will be other people involved. I have a daughter who's a nutritionist and there's very little I do that's right.Some hon. members: Oh, oh!Hon.

I heard your answer, but it was not clear. When are you going to act? The problem of diafiltered milk coming into Canada is really serious. It is costing producers approximately $1,000 a week.You said you were negotiating with industry representatives, but I sincerely believe that you have to take a leadership role in this file. More than 100 days have gone by since the election, and you still have not settled the issue. I know it is difficult, but I think that everyone agrees that the government has to apply the rules and standards that are already in place.Minister, when are you going to act to solve the problem of diafiltered milk in Canada?"}, {"turn": 19, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon.

I milked cows before I came here, and in fact, a few years after I came here, so I understand the issue. But there's a lot involved in this issue with different provinces. Just to make sure the record is straight, I am not negotiating with anybody. It's the industry and the manufacturers that are in discussions, but I am not negotiating with anybody. My job is to make sure that both sides understand the regulations. That's basically what I am doing at the moment. I can well understand how concerned you are, and I saw it a number of times in the House, but it's a process.

This problem has existed for two years; it also existed under the previous government. Everyone agrees that the federal government should take the lead and apply the rules. In my opinion, it is not that complicated a thing to do. Do you have a more specific idea of when you will be able to act in this regard?Whenever I go back to my riding, I meet with producers. They aren't just numbers; they are people, families. The dairy industry and supply management have suffered adverse impacts following the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. However, there is still no word about the compensation that was to be given to the industry. I am going to conclude this question by adding that I find this very frustrating.I have another very important question to ask.There have been some big losses and issues regarding labour, particularly in Quebec. In that province in 2014, these losses amounted to about $52 million. I have met with several key stakeholders from the industry, and everyone agrees that the government has to do something.Recently, your government made a change by granting an exemption to seafood processors in the Maritimes.

She has indicated they're going to conduct a review.It's my understanding that's what we did for the fish processors. It's just something that the previous government had done the year before, and we had just arrived on the scene and this happened, which I believe was a good thing to do.The whole program is under review. We have to make sure that we hear from sectors across the country, which I hear from, like the beef processors outside of Calgary and the processors in Quebec. It's vitally important that we hear from the sectors across the country and make sure that this program is put back in an appropriate manner.It's very difficult if you have the product, you have the market for the product, but you can't manufacture it in your own area. I understand that fully. But I think you also understand the problem that was faced, and what we want to make sure is that this evaluation of the program is done properly and that the people who are concerned, wherever it is in the country.... It's awfully important that you contact me, if you wish, or any member of the government or any member of the House of Commons, because you have positions right here and in other places to indicate your support for these types of—Yes, you were going to say something and I don't want to stop you."}, {"turn": 22, "speakerID": "218958", "name": "Ms. Ruth Ellen Brosseau", "contribution": "I have one quick question.

I was at the committee when we had the Safe Food for Canadians Act and there will be an evaluation, but it's not until 2017.Would you be interested in or are you open to the idea of supporting that the assessment be done sooner, because there have been so many articles and a lot of surveys and Canadians are really worried about the CFIA and how we are inspecting food here in Canada?"}, {"turn": 23, "speakerID": "214302", "name": "Hon.

But you have to stay on the cutting edge, as you indicated, and that's what I am attempting to do, to make sure that we do that. When you go across the country and look at our science centres and what they're doing, like producing the new seed that we talked about in 2014, and the big growth in production on the prairies, that was because of scientific work, too, of course. The seeds continue, and they continue and continue, to produce more with less. No matter what sector you're in...and with the beef producers I think it's 30% more production and a 15% reduction in the footprint. That's a big issue now around the world when you're trying to sell products.My job and our job as government wherever we are is to make sure, to the best of our ability and with the funds we have, that the scientists are able to stay on the cutting edge.

Lawrence MacAulay: Swathing, and I forget the proper name, but it's swathing. That itself saved one dollar and some cents per head per day. It's so important that you're able to have the people who know what they're doing work on this. In the laboratories they're able to develop resistant seeds that are resistant to different diseases, different insects. That makes us more competitive worldwide.

For instance, analyzing fertilizer and understanding what plants will absorb and what they will not absorb and how much water, this is all so important to the environment. It's just amazing what they do. What it does in the end is that the farmer can produce the crop with less money, and many times a bigger crop. That's what works and that's what will work worldwide, and that's part of what we have to try to do. That's not to mention there's no end to what you can develop, too, in the resistance line.

As I said before, if we have apple growers or processors of some kind in your riding—or in anybody else's riding—and we do not have the workers to do the processing, and if you have the apples or the potatoes or whatever it is but you don't have the manpower to run the plants, it's vitally important that this message is steered directly to this review.

I have a question from both sides of the farm gate, if you will, where we're looking at our trade. We're looking at our efficiencies within Canada and, on the producer side, at using science in trying to increase production with less inputs. You've covered that well in your introductory remarks. There are also cases of around 40% of food being wasted in the supply chain and at consumers' tables. How can we use big data on that side of the farm gate in terms of science and analyzing what's going on in order to be as efficient as we can be on that side of the gate, and then on the processor side of the gate as well, in saying that it's a business that we're trying to run here? As a country, we're trying to have our businesses be efficient, cost-controlled, and competitive, and we need to bring that together with the provinces, which, as you know, is a challenge sometimes, but I think you've done well. You were in Guelph last week and you met with the provincial and federal organizations, producers, and farm associations. We even had some farmers there who were talking about their challenges.Maybe you could expand on how you see your department working on these market opportunities in using the scientific information that we have available on both sides of the gate, and then trying to pull it together with the provinces and the different stakeholders.

I think it's fair to say that we are not, as a department, doing any specific research on the language question, but we are very sensitive to the need for the temporary foreign worker program to work effectively in all of its streams. You're talking about one specific stream of the temporary foreign worker program.The minister has had several discussions with his colleague Minister Mihychuk. The minister herself has indicated that she wants to bring questions about the temporary foreign worker program to committee to have the program examined and see how it's working. We can raise this issue.It's the first time, I have to admit, that I've heard about the language barrier being a serious problem."}, {"turn": 109, "speakerID": "218465", "name": "Mr. Mel Arnold", "contribution": "Okay. I will definitely follow up then with a letter to your ministry regarding this issue, because the language barrier has become a fairly significant issue for them.My second question is on the movement of grain. In 2014, it became a significant issue, and steps were taken to improve the movement of grain by rail to our ports. Those helped in that respect, but we understand that there was then a problem with bottlenecks at the elevators in the ports; they simply couldn't handle the volumes that were coming in.Is there anything in the main estimates now coming forward that is being directed towards either studying that issue or resolving it in some way, so that we can effectively get our farmers' products to markets overseas?"}, {"turn": 110, "speakerID": "133718", "name": "Mr. Greg Meredith", "contribution": "There's nothing specific in the main estimates, unless my colleague corrects me, but this government is very attentive to the problems of grain transport. You're quite right that there's a potentially acute problem when you have issues such as what happened in 2013-14, which was a record crop and a record cold winter that resulted in very significant backlogs, primarily in inland terminals.The government of the day took some temporary measures. Some of those measures will end on August 1, 2016, unless they're extended by Parliament. My minister has spent a great deal of time talking to stakeholders and getting feedback from stakeholders on the issue of extending those provisions, as well as on longer-term solutions with respect to the Canadian transportation system.As you're probably aware, the Canada Transportation Act was recently reviewed by an expert panel, which submitted its report to the Minister of Transport, and he has submitted it to Parliament and it's now public. It contains a number of wide-ranging recommendations with respect to transportation, not strictly grain. A great many of them deal either specifically with grain transportation, or more broadly with rail freight shipping.The government has undertaken to consult extensively on that report. In the minister's mandate letter, the Prime Minister has tasked him with looking at the grain supply chain in a fulsome way along with the Minister of Transport in the context of responding to the CTA review."}, {"turn": 111, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "We still have a minute."}, {"turn": 112, "speakerID": "218465", "name": "Mr. Mel Arnold", "contribution": "The almost $17.5 million earmarked for the agri-risk initiatives program, including $16.5 million in transfer amounts, is 40% higher than previous budget amounts.

Both the federal and provincial governments have responsibility, which imposes on governments the obligation to ensure that policies and programs are aligned, as much as possible. The policy frameworks that we put in place are negotiated with provinces for that reason, to ensure that we have policy alignment, that we are all pulling in the right direction, and that we remain responsive to local needs.The process we would pursue would bring us from roughly where we are now through April 1, 2018, which would be the implementation of the new framework. The minister has this obligation in his mandate letter. He will be spending some time between now and July 2016 discussing with the sector where they want to go and what priorities they want to bring to bear.July 2016 is important because ministers will be meeting in Calgary. One of the issues that will be on the table will be the next policy framework, and where ministers as a collective see that framework going.It is fair to say that our minister has made a commitment. I believe it will be shared by all ministers, to engage this sector in a fairly robust way between July and whenever programs and policies get put in place.

Federally we have a lot of input into the design and whether those programs are delivered by us directly or indirectly through a third party. When you talk about the business risk management suite of programs, those are the ones where sometimes we do involve third parties. At the federal level, our federal-only voted programs are delivered exclusively by the federal government. At the provincial level, for the $2 billion we talked about the last time in cost-shared programming, it's up to the provinces to decide how they will design and deliver those programs. In the context of discussions with the provinces and territories, we do have as part of those discussions an emphasis on service delivery. At the federal level we're focused on how we can improve the way we deliver those programs, including the adoption of technology and tools. We recognize that our clients have an expectation that they would be able to interface with the federal government the same way they can interface with other service providers, such as banks.

We want to make the minister aware of the importance of taking action and auditing the CFIA. We have to make sure that the agency has all the resources it needs.

An audit will be done in 2017, but I believe it is important to find out what the problems are and to take action.

However, as it relates to the issue of current resources for the agency, again I'll note, as I did earlier with the information we provided to this committee, that since the listeriosis event in 2008 the agency's front-line inspection resources have been significantly increased through a very strong commitment on the agency's part.In terms of front-line inspection, I certainly am very aware of the polling you refer to. As an agency, we will pay very close attention to the views of our staff, but at the same time, we'll also work with the resources that were allocated. We bring a very strong focus in the agency on prioritizing our actions in relation to risk and to focusing on delivering front-line inspection in relation to those risks.The actions on the part of the agency in delivering for Canadians have been recognized not just domestically but in the international context. The Conference Board of Canada's review of OECD member countries' food safety systems has ranked Canada number one, along with the Irish food safety system. We're proud of that outcome.

In the context of the current agricultural policy framework, we of course have three major programs that we deliver federally, one of them being the agri-innovation program, one of them being the agri-marketing program, and the third one being the agri-competitiveness program. In addition to that we have a few programs that fall outside our agricultural policy framework.In terms of the agri-innovation program in particular, it is the program that supports the funding of research and development, and that funding is often provided.... We support, for example, science clusters. We have 14 of those science clusters, and that funding can flow over a five-year period. They're quite large projects that support research and development that ultimately, at the end of the day, will be of benefit to producers. For example, we have a beef cluster, and the intention is that over time that research will actually translate and migrate at some point on farm and help producers who produce that particular commodity, and that would be true of all of our research clusters. In addition, we support a variety of research and development projects that are often shorter in duration and much more focused. Again, the intention is really to have the results of those research projects transition over time and play out at a farm level. Not every one of them happens immediately. Sometimes it takes a period of time for the research to actually translate to a point where it can be commercialized and applied on farm, and of course, all of our provinces and territories fund innovation programming as well, through the cost-shared strategic initiatives funding that's provided to them. Again, that would be programming that would support projects, at a local and regional level, that would be of benefit to the sector in all parts of the country.It's a comprehensive framework that provides support to individual projects that ultimately are supporting our producers."}, {"turn": 146, "speakerID": "216089", "name": "Mr. Pierre Breton", "contribution": "Thank you very much for your comprehensive answer."}, {"turn": 147, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Mr. Gourde, you have six minutes."}, {"turn": 148, "speakerID": "218376", "name": "Mr. Jacques Gourde", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.I have a quick question to ask, but before that, I would like to come back to Francis' comment and Mr. Poissant's answer.Mr. Poissant, congratulations on being appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. It's true that the code of ethics contains special provisions because, following your appointment, you become a public office holder. So there must be special and extraordinary provisions owing to the fact that you are an elected official.Francis talked about the chief of staff, who is also a public office holder, but is not elected.So I am asking Mr. Drouin to check whether the standards are the same. For our part, we don't believe that they are necessarily the same. A chief of staff is someone a cabinet decides to hire, an employee. They are not an elected official. There are extraordinary provisions because an elected official with agricultural holdings cannot be discriminated against.So I ask that you look into that and, if you want, send us the information later, as I want to use my time to ask another question that really affects me.This is for the department representatives.Two or three weeks ago, I talked about an important agricultural niche market we are currently hearing a lot about—maple syrup production. The Gagné report indicates that there is a problem in Quebec. The Americans are increasing their production significantly. According to the Gagné report, the Americans are being subsidized to increase their number of maple tree taps. We are not doing that because we are complying with free trade laws.There are a number of ways to subsidize maple syrup producers. It can be done directly or indirectly. The government can fund the roads leading to the sugar bush or a power line. It can fund a number of things without providing direct subsidies.I asked the department representatives to check whether it was true that the Farm Bill allowed for direct or indirect subsidies for the production of maple syrup in the United States and, if so, if that was in compliance with NAFTA rules."}, {"turn": 149, "speakerID": "220566", "name": "Mr. Frédéric Seppey (Chief Agriculture Negotiator, Trade Agreements and Negotiations, Market and Industry Services Branch, Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food)", "contribution": "I want to thank the member for the question.I was not aware of that request, but we could indeed look further into the issue and follow up, if the committee so wishes.The U.S. Farm Bill is a piece of legislation that has a very broad scope and contains many elements. That is why we constantly have to look at many of the elements contained in the Farm Bill to ensure not only that they do not hinder the economic interests of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector, but also that they comply with the rules, as you pointed out.I can't tell you right now whether the support for the U.S. maple syrup industry is causing compliance issues with NAFTA rules or World Trade Organization rules. That's something we can look into.Generally speaking, since maple products are a Canadian symbol, we support that sector in various ways, whether we are talking about developing international markets, developing innovative farm practices or other initiatives.

As you know, in British Columbia the big movement about 10 or 15 years ago, which I think is now expanding, was based on a regional food security agenda. It started out as a small-scale farmer's market but is now very lucrative and includes the whole of the Pacific northwest. We've reached a point of critical mass where we can start exporting beyond simply California, Washington, and Oregon.How specifically can we work within these clusters that you have? I asked the minister about a program at Kwantlen. If I wanted to create a research centre dealing with mixed farming that would look at how we can expand and make more commercially viable our security policy for British Columbia and that whole area, how would I go about doing that?

That maybe would be a place where I would go first to see if there is anything we can do together bilaterally with them, because for everything in the Pacific northwest they have a significant presence and footprint there.

How can I work with the existing structures and all these wonderful programs to create a research centre at Kwantlen, working with UBC or other institutions of education in B.C.?"}, {"turn": 159, "speakerID": "204792", "name": "Mr. Gilles Saindon", "contribution": "What I would like to add to this is that perhaps within the province of British Columbia, I would refer to it as a virtual research centre, because we have structures federally and also provincially. The universities and also the ministries of agriculture and forestry have some facilities. We also have the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on the ground there. That might be a way to mobilize industry. We could work with the existing programs we have, such as agri-innovation and clusters and projects, which could be led by particular areas, and we would just mobilize these people and work in partnership, but it would be a virtual arrangement. That's basically what agri-innovation programming is all about. It allows us to mobilize the people across various jurisdictions—federal, provincial, universities, and industry—and we can work together on these projects."}, {"turn": 160, "speakerID": "216084", "name": "Mr. Joe Peschisolido", "contribution": "I see. So there isn't a program where...? I have scientists, professors, and young farmers who want to get into the industry. There isn't a program where we can get some funds and actually start a research centre at Kwantlen or tie it up with Simon Fraser and UBC to look at this stuff?"}, {"turn": 161, "speakerID": "204792", "name": "Mr. Gilles Saindon", "contribution": "We would have to look into the eligibility of these programs, yes."}, {"turn": 162, "speakerID": "216084", "name": "Mr. Joe Peschisolido", "contribution": "That's excellent.There's one other question I wanted to ask, if I have a moment. There are also farmers in my area that are bypassing the process. They do direct marketing, and it's very lucrative, whether it's in potatoes, chickens, or whatever. They're doing this on their own. Do they have a niche market because there's a safety issue and maybe animal welfare issues...? People want to buy the products. They are in my riding and they're all over, I would say. They're in metro Vancouver and in Chilliwack and across the whole area there. Are there any programs we can use to help these individual farmers who are doing direct marketing and maybe tie that into how the department functions in its view of agriculture?"}, {"turn": 163, "speakerID": "206774", "name": "Ms. Tina Namiesniowski", "contribution": "Mr. Chairman, maybe I can attempt to answer that question.Under our market development stream of programming that's offered at the federal level, we have what we refer to as generic market development, as well as the market development support that we provide small and medium-sized enterprises. Generic market development is targeted at associations that represent either a commodity or a part of the sector.The small and medium-sized component of our agri-marketing program allows us to deal specifically with a smaller organization that is working on their own behalf to market their products abroad. There are some eligibility requirements around that. Typically, it's an organization that has fewer than 250 employees and annual sales that don't exceed $50 million. Through that stream, we're able to provide in-year funding to small and medium-sized enterprises to enable them to market their product abroad."}, {"turn": 164, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Ms. Namiesniowski and Mr. Peschisolido.Mr. Gourde, or rather Mr. Arnold, will now have five minutes."}, {"turn": 165, "speakerID": "218465", "name": "Mr. Mel Arnold", "contribution": "I have one question, and then I may pass my time on to Mr. Aboultaif.I've looked at the estimate sheets, and everything seems to be fairly consistent there, but what I usually do with these sheets is look for anomalies. One that I spotted is in the community pastures program, with a significant cut in the FTE positions from 133 down to 90. That's 43 positions. Perhaps you can explain that large cut."}, {"turn": 166, "speakerID": "108960", "name": "Mr. Pierre Corriveau", "contribution": "From an FTE point of view, as you know, the government announced in budget 2012 the gradual transfer of the community pasture programs to the various provinces—Manitoba and Saskatchewan in particular—so this reflects the gradual reduction over five years, and we're now in year three.My colleague here, Tina, who was managing this program can provide you with more details."}, {"turn": 167, "speakerID": "206774", "name": "Ms. Tina Namiesniowski", "contribution": "We now find ourselves in year three of a five-year divestiture process, so at this point in time the Government of Canada has ceased operating federal community pastures in the province of Manitoba. We're still engaged in the province of Saskatchewan, although in keeping with the divestiture schedule, by the end of March 2018, we will have ceased the operation of federal pastures in the province of Saskatchewan as well.We have staff who will continue to work in the pasture operation until that period of time. We continue to run those pastures on the land that has yet to be divested back to the province, and we'll continue to do so until we cease the operation of the federal program."}, {"turn": 168, "speakerID": "218465", "name": "Mr. Mel Arnold", "contribution": "Thank you.The fostering business development, it's also under the Industry Capacity main title, but again I see a loss from 13 down to 6 in FTE's, that's more than a cut in half. Is that part of a transfer to the Growing Forward 2 program, or can you explain that fairly significant cut? It's in table 3 of the document we were provided."}, {"turn": 169, "speakerID": "108960", "name": "Mr. Pierre Corriveau", "contribution": "Maybe we'll get back to the chair. We can look for the answer. Maybe my colleague can talk about the program per se."}, {"turn": 170, "speakerID": "206774", "name": "Ms. Tina Namiesniowski", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, under our agri-competitiveness program, we have a stream that is referred to as fostering business development, and that is a stream that provides $15.6 million in contribution funding over five years to not-for-profit organizations that operate nationally and have experience in delivering services and products for farmers and producers.For example, that would include 4-H as one of those organizations we support under that program.Those are agreements that we entered into at the start of the agricultural policy framework, and they will continue until the end of the framework . Those agreements with those organizations last for five years."}, {"turn": 171, "speakerID": "108960", "name": "Mr. Pierre Corriveau", "contribution": "I think we'll have to get back to you with more detail.

Since the 2013-14 fiscal year, spending on internal services has increased for the CGC, the Canadian Grain Commission. Internal services include activities that support and enable delivery of the CGC's strategic outcome and programs to the CGC stakeholders. Can you explain why spending has increased?"}, {"turn": 175, "speakerID": "108960", "name": "Mr. Pierre Corriveau", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. That's a good question.There's no official from the CGC, but we work collaboratively between the two organizations.In the past the department used to provide a human resources service to the Canadian Grain Commission, but they're really like a separate entity from the department, so this reflects the Canadian Grain Commission's taking on the responsibility for delivering their human resources to their own organization."}, {"turn": 176, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Ms. Brosseau, you have the floor for three minutes."}, {"turn": 177, "speakerID": "218958", "name": "Ms. Ruth Ellen Brosseau", "contribution": "Thank you.

Personally, I haven't heard those specific comments, but I have a high degree of confidence that the sector is very prepared to provide us feedback. We've been through this process with the sector now since 2003, three times already. This will be a fourth time. What we've seen already is that national and provincial organizations, both the horizontal and the commodity-specific, have already developed positions. They've already made themselves available to ministers and officials, and they'll continue to engage us on a very wide front. It may very well come up."}, {"turn": 184, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you. I would like to ask a quick question before we finish this.With the trade agreements we're getting ready to sign, do you see any changes, or potential changes, to the way we deliver the program?
