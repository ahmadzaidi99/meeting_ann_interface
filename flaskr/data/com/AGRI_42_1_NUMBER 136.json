Thanks for being here for this emergency meeting on the official notices of non-compliance from China for exports of Canadian canola seeds.\n              With us this morning, as individuals, are Mr. William Gerrard, of Invernorth Ltd.; and Mark Kaun, a canola producer.\n               As well, we have, from the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association, Stephen Vandervalk, who is the vice-president, Alberta. \n              Welcome to our committee this morning. Thanks for being here.\n              Also, I would draw to the attention of fellow MPs that we have present in the audience a delegation from the Prairie Oat Growers Association. Several board members from across the Prairies are attending our meeting and would be grateful to exchange with you after the meeting. \n              Thank you to the oat growers from the western provinces for being here.\n              Members, as you know, there is going to be a vote. We have time for the opening statements, and hopefully we'll get back to ask the questions. \n              Mr. Vandervalk, you have up to six minutes for your opening statement."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "87552", "name": "Mr. Stephen Vandervalk (Vice-President, Alberta, Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, members of Parliament, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.\n              My name is Stephen Vandervalk, and I'm a fourth-generation farmer from the Fort Macleod area of southern Alberta. I've been farming my whole life. I'm past-president of the Grain Growers of Canada, and current director with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. \n              Most grain farmers are entrepreneurial. We were pleased when the Wheat Board was disbanded, and we were able to sell our grain competitively on the world market ourselves. We were pleased when the current government said that they wanted to increase agriculture exports by 25% by 2025. We were pleased that the trade agreements, CETA and CPTPP, have been signed.\n              However, when grain growers are caught as innocent political pawns in events they have no control over, they always pay the price. I currently plant 4,500 acres of canola. Since the announcement in early March by China that they were putting a stop on the importation of Canadian canola, the futures bids have dropped, costing me $50,000 on my old crop, or what I have in the bin today. Looking at the 2019 crop, I potentially could lose another $100,000, or much more if this continues. \n              The worst-case scenario is there will not be any bids for canola. Multiply that across 43,000 Canadian canola growers in western Canada and we face potential losses in the billions. Yes, let me repeat that: We face potential losses in the billions of dollars. That's real money out of every grain farmer's bottom line. Imagine a loss of that magnitude as it rolls out and impacts machinery and truck dealers, local suppliers, support services and all the ancillary services. The cost is enormous.\n              The timing of this issue and the timing of my being here could not be worse. I should be at home seeding. Thankfully, my family's able to help cover for me. The season is short, and this issue is weighing heavily on every grain farmer. \n              You already know that China is the largest end market for Canadian canola, accounting for approximately 40% of all Canadian canola products exported annually. In 2018, canola seed exported to China generated $2.7 billion according to the Canola Council of Canada. That Canadian canola crop contributes $26.7 billion annually to the Canadian economy. \n              The statement from China that they are not buying our canola because of dangerous pests is ludicrous. Canada is noted for consistently growing and exporting the best grain in the world. This is a political issue, pure and simple. Political problems need political solutions. If we must play the game of grain inspections, so be it, but in the meantime, Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.\n              I remind this committee that this is not the only current agricultural failing that grain farmers are facing. The list of significant trade issues for the Canadian grains industry has grown long. \n              Italy is no longer importing the world's best Canadian durum due to non-tariff trade barriers. Over the past few years we have usually exported one million tonnes valued at $250 million. The durum market has been decimated. We can't even sell it. \n              Our sixth-largest market, Peru, has stopped importing Canadian wheat, claiming we have a weed seed issue. At over one million tonnes, that's another $200 million. \n              Vietnam has stopped importing Canadian wheat, claiming that it has thistle seeds in it. That market was over $4 million.\n              India has applied massive tariffs on our pulse crops, valued at over $1 billion. \n               Saudi Arabia is not importing our wheat and barley valued at over $4 million, due to a diplomatic dispute.\n              In case you weren't adding up these numbers, that's over $4.2 billion in direct export sales annually. Using the multiplier effect of 1.5, this is a potential loss to our economy of $6.3 billion.\n              Grain farmers aren't looking for financial handouts. We're looking to grow our exports, our crop sales, on a level playing field. We can compete with any country in the world if we don't have one arm tied behind our backs. Unfair non-tariff trade barriers and one-sided taxes, such as the carbon tax, force Canadian grain farmers into impossible situations. We ask you not to force us into uncompetitive situations. \n              The combined potential loss through export losses to China, Italy, Peru, Vietnam, India and Saudi Arabia is staggering. Canada can feed the world, but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks. \n              This week the Minister of Environment and Climate Change  announced $12 million in funding to Loblaws, one of Canada's largest companies, owned by one of Canada's richest families. Frankly, it is embarrassing and a slap in the face to grain farmers when this takes place. If you truly want ingenuity and a clean economy, support agriculture. Support us not through handouts, but by getting out of the way of the modernization and growing practices that we've been developing for the past 20 years. Agriculture has been on the leading edge of environmental protections: sequestering carbon through our low-till and no-till seeding using GPS and AI, minimizing our inputs and carbon footprint, all the while maximizing grain output. \n              If you want to effectively maximize the benefits of Canadian agriculture, take the steps necessary to reduce and eliminate the barriers that farmers are facing today. We plan our crop rotations in a very scientific manner. Factors such as soil types, markets, history of crops on the piece of land, fertilizer and other inputs are all used to determine what crops we should plant. \n              \n               We do this every year, well in advance of spring seeding. Now we are faced with a huge disruption that changes everything.\n              Are farmers concerned? We sure are, and rightly so. Our future depends on these outcomes. These combined issues are already becoming the largest crisis our farms have ever seen in 100 years.\n              Give us the assurance that you are resolving these issues, not with empty words but with actions. Show us that you mean what you say.\n              Thank you. We look forward to your questions."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Vandervalk.\n              Mr. Gerrard, the floor is yours for up to six minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "247716", "name": "Mr. William Gerrard (Invernorth Ltd., As an Individual)", "contribution": "Thank you for inviting me to Ottawa today to address the committee on this very important issue of canola trade to China.\n              My name is Will Gerrard. I'm a 35-year-old fourth-generation farmer. My wife Jacqueline and I have three young children. We're partners in a family farm located just south of Riding Mountain National Park in western Manitoba.\n              We have tried to implement a diverse crop rotation including hemp, wheat, canola, soybeans, peas and grass seed. The invention of canola was a huge boost to farms in western Canada, especially in the cool parkland region where I farm. This is quite evident if you drive through or fly over my area in the summer, as you will see a full 50% of the fields are yellow canola crops in full bloom.\n              Over the past 40 years of growing canola on our farm, it has evolved from a small acreage specialty crop to become a cornerstone of predictable profits. Of course, as with anything in farming, it is not without its ups and downs. In my short 17-year farming career, we have sold canola for as low as $6.50 a bushel and as high as $15 a bushel. Yields have ranged from 20 bushels per acre, when a disastrous August frost struck in 2004, to up to 70 bushels per acre, when everything clicks just right to produce a bumper crop.\n              Prior to 2019, three crops we produced faced significant trade and marketing issues. In 2017, low-cost Chinese hempseed hitting the international market played a significant role in buyers in the hempseed exporting and processing industry losing premium markets. This resulted in a price drop of 20% to 30% for this commodity, making it unprofitable for us to produce. Everyone is aware of the impact of the India tariffs on pulse crops, causing prices of peas and lentils to drop significantly for Canadian growers. More recently, the slump in soybean futures prices in the U.S., due in part to China backing away from U.S. soybean imports, has also impacted soybean prices in a negative way for Canadian growers.\n              Admittedly, peas and hemp were relatively small acreage crops for us, and we were able to shift acres to larger market crops, like soybeans and wheat. With the recent blockage of Canadian canola going into China, and in turn the dollar per bushel drop in canola prices, I think I speak for my fellow farmers in Manitoba in expressing concern that we are running out of profitable crops to grow.\n              The recent drop in canola prices caused a direct loss to our farm on remaining canola inventories from the 2018 year, totalling about $70,000. If this issue is not resolved, I am concerned that prices will continue to drop as seed inventories build in Canada. Losses next year on our farm could be in the hundreds of thousands and this money would be lost from the local economy forever. Seeded canola acres will most certainly drop this spring, and this acreage will shift to smaller market crops and drive the price of those commodities lower as well.\n              As you can see, the trickle-down effects of the canola ban to China are numerous and significant.\n              Where I live in western Manitoba, grain farming creates a massive share of the economic activity in our local communities. Some of the big employers in the area consist of agricultural equipment dealers, crop input retailers and grain purchasing and processing companies. I have already heard talk amongst fellow growers about cancelling machinery orders and cutting back on crop inputs for the coming year. When farm profits suffer, the economic well-being of our entire community will suffer just as much.\n              Farmers are constantly striving to become more efficient with our inputs. We've invested in technologies invented by Canadian companies, such as precision seed and fertilizer placement and sectional control to eliminate the over-application of pesticides and fertilizers. We have done these things out of necessity to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The worst-case scenario for us is to lose the global markets we have worked so hard to obtain and stay competitive in.\n              I urge members of Parliament from all parties to work together with industry and farmers. We have worked hard to develop a safe and reliable oilseed crop in canola, and we don't want to lose it."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Gerrard.\n              Do I have the consent of the committee to continue to hear the third witness? \n              Okay.\n              Mr. Kaun, you're up for six minutes."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "247713", "name": "Mr. Mark Kaun (Canola Producer, As an Individual)", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              My name is Mark Kaun. I'm a third-generation farmer on the land that I own. I produce wheat, barley, peas and canola—a rotation of crops for the best agronomic practices for minimum disease issues and maximum yield.\n              I have a GPS precision farming practice of variable rate technology for seed and fertilizer, sectional control of herbicide application to maximize my return on investment and to minimize the environmental impacts. Yield data is collected digitally at time of harvest to build fertility maps for the next year's seed, and fertility variable rate maps.\n              We have practised minimum tillage for over 30 years.\n              In our operation, we use consultants for agronomy, fertility and grain marketing.\n              All seed is treated for soil-borne pathogens. In the case of canola seed, we use up-to-date genetics with resistance to blackleg and clubroot.\n              I'm a graduate of Olds College, in crop production. I am currently serving in my second term on the board of governors of that college.\n              I carry an Alberta environment licence to apply agricultural herbicides and seed treatments. I have over 40 years in seed production experience in wheat, barley, peas and canola. I was an authorized seed cleaner and seed grader under the CFIA and the Canadian Seed Institute.\n              The situation today is that I am holding 500 metric tons of unpriced 2018 crop on my farm. My 2018 production was just over 600 metric tons. My first 100 metric tons was contracted in the summer and sold and delivered in November for $11.30. The first week of February, prices seen were around $11 and I was getting ready to sell the rest of my crop. Then 10 days later, my crop was worth a dollar a bushel less, at the minimum—a cost of $25,000 to my bottom line.\n              Changing cropping plans really doesn't work to maintain the best agronomic practices in this spring. Canola seed has been purchased. I have 50 bags waiting in the warehouse at $600 a bag. Fertilizer has been bought and booked. Switching to other crops is hard, because cereal seed is in short supply in Alberta. Storage of last year's crop will be tricky. Some of the canola has a green count to it and it is susceptible to heating in the bins. I would like to move that as soon as possible. I don't have room to carry two years of production in my storage facilities. Cash flow is needed for all farmers.\n              Changing seeding plans impacts seed retailers. Seed purchases are made in January and February and are booked for May. I would hate to phone my seed supplier and tell him that I don't need that $25,000 of seed—now what would he do with it? Then 15 other farmers phone him to do the same thing.\n              As a Canadian producer, I take pride in producing safe, clean products for export around the world. I have never had a contamination issue with any of my products. I have never been turned away at an elevator.\n              Unknown factors such as this situation are not foreseeable and cause great disruption in our operations, impacting future production and farm finances. If I were to be hailed out, I have insurance for that. If my canola has not been able to be hauled or delivered, I have no insurance for that.\n              The diversification of our markets needs improvement. Government intervention is needed and pressure is needed to be put on more forcefully.\n              Canadian canola is contaminated. It's contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy. No pathogens or weed seeds are in our canola.\n              Thank you for your time."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Kaun.\n              I think we'll probably be back around noon, after the vote.

We've had to go to the trade committee—not ag—in order to speak to the ministers on this and to talk to some of our trade officials. We've also heard from national commodity groups. The point now is to talk to farmers who are being affected—the ones who are going to be out there putting the seed in the ground.\n              Mr. Kaun, very few people understand the seed business and the things that are associated with it, like insurance, inspections and all of the other things associated with it.

For a seed retailer to stock and hold this stuff year after year is formidable. \n              This year, due to the severe fall we had, other seed crops that we could switch to are basically unavailable because of poor germination and things like that. It's fine if one or two farmers change their decisions in your area, but if the whole province all of a sudden doesn't want to grow canola, now there's a shortage on cereals or peas or whatever else. Seed stocks are an expensive thing to keep year after year. \n              It's really hard to change your rotations in that regard, too, because if there's no seed, you're stuck.

It's kind of a double negative: I have $25,000 of seed sitting there to pay for and I'm minus $25,000. When I went to school, that was $50,000.

Furthermore, when we're looking at the size of the Chinese market, are we sometimes blinded by that with regard to how they've dealt with other countries in the past when threats to their national pride have been made?

The impact on canola futures contracts, and therefore on canola prices, is very clear.\n              Between February 4 and 8, 2019, May canola prices were stable at around $492 per ton. The market decline began during the first week of April. The May contract closed at an average of $457 per ton. That is a price drop of $35 per ton in two months, a loss of more than 7%, due to the closure of the Chinese market.\n              It is true that Quebec canola is not intended for export. It is mainly used locally by the Bécancour crushing plant, but the local price structure is tied to the future contracts. As a result, Quebec canola producers are being hit hard by the dropping prices.\n              On top of the measurable exchange prices and losses, we are also affected by the uncertainty surrounding access to the Chinese market. Indeed, China is a major market for Quebec soy beans, both GMO and non-GMO. Despite the statement that the conflict with China is limited to canola, grain trading is undeniably affected by this perception of risk hovering over the Canada-China trade relationship. \n              Markets dislike uncertainty. We hear from various sources that soy bean trading has slowed down in Quebec, which could result in a substantial increase in end-of-season stocks. It should be noted that Quebec canola producers are also major soy bean producers.\n              Further collateral damages are looming on the horizon. According to Richardson International's President, canola acreage in Western Canada could decline by 10% this year. This would mean that more than 900,000 hectares normally reserved for canola would be seeded with other grains, mainly cereal grains. That could lead to a surplus in Western Canadian grain production in 2019-2020, which would result in lower grain prices in Quebec, since we operate in a North American free market for grains.\n              As mentioned earlier, the canola issue must be seen as another layer of problems that are harming canola producers in Quebec.\n              Thank you very much."}, {"turn": 60, "speakerID": "103883", "name": "Mr. William Van Tassel (Vice-President, Producteurs de grains du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, As an Individual)", "contribution": "My name is William Van Tassel. I have been growing canola since 1988 in Lac-Saint-Jean.\n              The impact on markets only reveals one aspect of the problem. What is also detrimental to Quebec producers is the support given to competitors, particularly in the United States. This support, intended to stabilize the incomes of U.S. grain producers or to offset the effects of trade disputes or discriminatory economic and trade policies, create a significant competitive disadvantage.\n              In the case of canola, the U.S. PLC Program paid out between $90 and $125CAN per hectare during 2016 and 2017.\n              For pork, Quebec producers will receive, mostly from the Canadian government, support from the Agri-Invest Program, which amounts to less than $10 per hectare, or 1% of eligible net sales.\n              One should not underestimate the U.S. crop insurance program, which is very generous in the United States for canola. The average net premium fell between $35 to $40CAN per hectare, from 2016 to 2018. The comparable amount is approximately $8 per hectare in Quebec and we can say across Canada as well.\n              When it comes to soy beans, the core U.S. programs, the ARC and the PLC, anticipate paying out between $800 million and $900 million per year, over a total area of 34 million hectares. This amounts to between $20 and $26CAN per hectare. In the context of the trade dispute with China, the U.S. government will contribute nearly $9 billionCAN more to soy bean production in 2018 and 2019, which is nearly $269CAN more per hectare. The amounts paid in Quebec—and normally in Canada—under the Agri-Invest Program are between $10 and $12 per hectare for soy beans.\n              In addition, there is the trade dispute between the United States and Canada over tariffs on steel and aluminum. According to the industry, this trade dispute will add 6% to the price of machinery and parts. Given that depreciation costs are $125 per hectare for canola and $165 per hectare for soy beans, these are additional annual costs of $7 and $10 per hectare, respectively.\n              In closing, the trade dispute with China over canola has major impacts on production and income, and these impacts may continue. However, they must be put into perspective with regard to all the ongoing trade disputes, which affect grain producers in Quebec and Canada, particularly canola producers. We are seeing that the safety net in place in Canada to deal with these crises is insufficient and threatens the sustainability of our farms. The Government of Canada must adopt, as soon as possible, a farm business risk management policy that reflects the trade disputes, the subsidy policies of competing countries, and the market access restrictions that grain producers face on a daily basis."}, {"turn": 61, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Van Tassel. Your time is up.\n              \n               Ms. Mehgin Reynolds is next for six minutes."}, {"turn": 62, "speakerID": "247706", "name": "Ms. Mehgin Reynolds (Farmer, LPG Farms, As an Individual)", "contribution": "I'd like to start by thanking the standing committee for the opportunity to be here today. I'm a grain farmer in southwest Saskatchewan who, like many other producers across Canada, is very concerned about the notices of non-compliance we are seeing from China with regard to our canola seed exports. I'm sure many of you already know that China is the largest market for Canadian canola, accounting for approximately 40% of all canola generated in Canada.\n              In 2018, canola seed exported to China generated $2.7 billion, and according to the Canola Council of Canada, the Canadian canola crop contributes $26.7 billion annually to the Canadian economy. \n              Canola is a very important crop for the producers who grow it. Traditionally, it has been one of the main commodities to generate revenue for our operations. Canola is often a crucial part of a crop rotation, allowing for producers to diversify with crops that do not bring in as much revenue but allow for more sustainable farming practices. On my farm, we rotate between cereals, oilseeds and pulses. An example of a four-year crop rotation is lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat. \n              Farmers are resilient. We are often referred to as eternal optimists. We have worked hard to hedge our bets. We have worked hard to find ways to mitigate the risk that we face day to day. We grow a variety of crops not only to be more sustainable but also to allow us to manage the risk that comes from relying on a global market to sell our product. \n              If canola were the only commodity we grow that was currently facing a trade barrier—and I'm sorry but I don't believe for a second that this has anything to do with science; this is political retaliation—we would be able to hunker down and take a couple of years of lower prices. The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another. \n              Italy has shut out our durum wheat. India has enforced heavy tariffs on Canadian pulses, effectively shutting their border to our product. Saudi Arabia has cancelled grain imports, affecting approximately 122,000 tonnes of barley feed. Now China is turning away our canola seed. Let's add to this a carbon tax and areas that are heading into their third year of challenging weather, be that extreme drought or excess moisture. What we have brewing are conditions for the perfect storm. \n              According to Statistics Canada's 2016 census of agriculture report, there are just over 107,000 farms in western Canada. These farms account for approximately 85% of the crop acres in Canada, and approximately 97% of these farms are family owned and operated. Agriculture and crop production are very important to the Canadian economy, so much so that the recent Barton report named agriculture as one of six possible top drivers for the Canadian economy moving forward.\n              This information was used to create ambitious targets for us to hit both domestically and internationally by 2025. Now, I ask you, how are we in agriculture going to have any hope of meeting these targets when we do not have healthy bilateral trade agreements, relationships or respect on the global trading platform that our country relies on?\n              There are different possibilities for how this can all play out. I think it's safe to say that we will see some last-minute changes being made to the number of canola acres planted. I stood beside a farmer at the local co-op a couple of days ago and listened to him cancel some of his canola seed order to take 160 acres out of his canola rotation. He's still going to seed that 160 acres, so the question becomes what crop is a safer bet? If he's looking to keep his oilseed rotation, then it's most likely flax or mustard that he will put down. These are more niche markets, and what we can see happening is that these contract prices will drop as supply increases. We also could be looking at other end markets using China's notices of non-compliance to push the canola price lower as we have limited trading options and, quite frankly, are still trying to move 2018's crop. \n              Farmers are not looking for a handout, nor are we wanting to require a subsidy for cash flow in our operations. That being said, increasing the amount farmers have access to in the cash advance program would help many manage the capital required to get through this year. Many producers are sitting on canola, lentils and other crops from last year in the hopes that prices will go up and trade disputes will be resolved. \n               We want regulations and policies in place that are science-based allowing us to grow, invest and continue fuelling our sustainability and the Canadian economy. We want a government in power that isn't so internally focused on scandals that it forgets the importance of our global trade. Canada is a nation dependent on global trade and we are at a logistical disadvantage when it comes to our location and the means by which we transport our export goods to market. We need to be very aware of these challenges and put the appropriate level of respect into our trade agreements and partners. \n              \n              As a grain farmer, I deal with a huge amount of risk and uncertainty because I cannot control the weather. We can control our actions, our relationships and our bilateral trade agreements. Trade should not be the biggest wild card in the deck when it comes to the success of my family farming operation.\n              Thank you."}, {"turn": 63, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Ms. Reynolds.\n              Now we go to Mr. Youzwa for six minutes."}, {"turn": 64, "speakerID": "235159", "name": "Mr. Terry Youzwa", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              Good day.\n              I'm speaking today as an independent farmer from northeast Saskatchewan. I've represented growers in various capacities for over 25 years. I am a past-chairman of the Canola Council of Canada and I appreciated the opportunity I had to represent growers and be an ambassador for canola by participating in a federal trade mission to China in 2014.\n              I'll start with some comments on the economic impact and pain on our revenue streams. Then I'll talk about the importance of open and stable trade relationships and finally, I'll offer some solutions and steps on how to work towards solving this important matter.\n              You've heard a lot about how important canola is. It has been by far Canada's largest cash revenue generating crop for over 10 years now, with 250,000 jobs across the country and 43,000 farmers, roughly speaking. On our farm it has already declined over a dollar a bushel. If it isn't solved soon, it could easily decline by $2 a bushel over the coming months. Let's do some rough math: about 20 million acres, at $2 a bushel and 50 bushels an acre, that's $2 billion. This is only canola we're talking about and it doesn't include current inventory that's in the bin from last year's crop. Let's realize that canola is only one crop we grow, but for many of us, it's our most important and most profitable crop, and it has the largest percentage of acres on our farm.\n              Farmers would rather receive their revenue from the marketplace. If the government does not play a role in resolving this matter quickly, the need for additional substantial business risk management program increases will be very real. How will that impact your fiscal deficit?\n              When trade is unpredictable, risk increases and prices decrease. Farmers may reduce inputs to reduce the risk and lower the cost as well. This has ramifications up and down the value stream. Grain companies, processors, railways, economic activity and volumes at ports like Vancouver and the St. Lawrence Seaway will all experience negative impacts as the entire industry contracts because of this risk in the marketplace. What multiple of $2 billion does this contraction of our economy become when all sectors of the canola industry are taken into account? Predictability and planning projections are thrown under a bus for all players up and down the value stream. In this environment capital expenditures both on our farms and throughout the industry contract and reduce as organizations of all sizes reduce risk. This is a troubling trend. We see these non-science-based barriers to trade in multiple markets, like China, India, Saudi Arabia and Italy.\n              Predictable, stable trade is a vital component to our nation's economy. Actions have consequences. A lack of action is also a decision and not a solution. It allows the problem to fester, grow and exacerbate. We must learn from the past. Trade relationships must be nurtured constantly to maintain functionality and predictability. We rely on our national organizations and our federal government to constantly act on our behalf, to keep trade functioning in a proper, predictable manner.\n              China, India, Saudi Arabia and Italy are all examples of countries we suddenly have trade issues with. Even getting the CPTPP agreed to was more challenging than it needed to be. This is a troubling trend. Why do we have these issues we've never had before? What have we, as a nation, learned from the recent past? There's a message here that, when dealing with trade agreements and contracts, countries should only be dealing with commerce and specific tolerances must be based on science. Surely we have learned that deviating from this only leads to massive risk and market disruptions.\n              Actions do have consequences. When countries work and negotiate in good faith, issues can be resolved. We need open, stable trade, and we expect our government to help provide that. It shouldn't be too much to ask. Market access is vital to my bottom line and that of the other 43,000 growers. The ramifications run up and down the entire value chain. They also impact the entire nation when we start talking about the reduced volumes for Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, Vancouver port, Thunder Bay and the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n              What can we do now that we are in this situation? First of all, let's realize the Asia nations respect people in positions of authority. They also appreciate ongoing stable relationships. Canada has not had an ambassador in China since early January. Why was this important position not filled months ago? What message does that send? Fill this position immediately with an agriculture champion who understands China.\n              \n               Second, we can learn from past experience with China. There have been trade issues before regarding dockage and blackleg concerns for canola. Through proper negotiation with high-level, technical people from both countries these issues were resolved.\n              I would suggest high-level negotiations from our country are required. We should strive to obtain a working arrangement immediately with a timeline to resolve the matter. This was done in the past with China where trade was extended allowing enough time for the specific issue to be resolved by a deadline. China has not yet been forthcoming with this information on this occasion. Since they have not proven it is a specific tolerance issue, we are overdue for a high-level political meeting to discuss what is going on and how to resolve it.\n              I do support the efforts of the relatively new canola working group. Time is of the essence. It is already over a month since this canola issue started and we are no closer to it being resolved. I would also encourage high-level political discussions led by two senior ministers to get this file moving. I am encouraging you to take action on two fronts, one technical and one political. Time is precious and our future and the economy of our nation are at stake. \n              Third, increase the renewable fuel—"}, {"turn": 65, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Youzwa.

Why are they so afraid of letting the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food talk about the canola crisis before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food? It's totally unacceptable.\n              Today, we heard evidence from Mr. Vandervalk and Mr. Youzwa. Everyone is telling us that action is absolutely necessary on two fronts: the technical front and the political front.\n              We have been calling for the politicians to appear before this committee and are told no each time. We asked for this meeting to be extended by 30 minutes in order to hear from people and were told no. We requested emergency debates in the House and we were told no.\n              What is the problem? What are the people opposite afraid of? Why do the Liberals get frightened whenever we talk about the canola crisis? Why can't we talk about it, Mr. Chair? I find this absolutely absurd.\n              It is not complicated; we are asking for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to come and tell us how she plans to manage this file politically. We are also asking for an appearance by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n              We have heard evidence from Mr. Youzwa and Mr. Van Tassel. Lots of people have told us that the canola crisis is a reflection of what is currently going on internationally. It is not just about canola. Trade with India, Italy and many other countries is problematic too. Unfortunately, whenever we try to talk about these problems and what the government or parliamentarians could do to find a solution to this crisis, we have been told there will be no discussion and those ministers will not be invited to appear.\n              Some farmers will be appearing this afternoon before the Standing Committee on International Trade. Farmers can appear before this committee. We are asking for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to come and testify, but we are told that it cannot be done. They are afraid.\n              Mr. Chair, this is unacceptable. I do not understand why, This is an urgent crisis. The people here this morning are calling on us to move swiftly and take concrete action immediately.\n              We are offering the committee an opportunity to get some answers and for producers to find out what is going to happen. Unfortunately, we are unable to hear what the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have to say, neither here nor at the Standing Committee on International Trade, for reasons unknown to me. And yet, it is an international crisis.\n              We called again for the appointment of an ambassador. That is the responsibility of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, of Global Affairs Canada, but we cannot have her here.\n              I am asking that we discuss the motion with fresh facts and I am told I cannot. People will be able to judge for themselves how willing each party here is to resolving this canola crisis. We, on this side, genuinely want to find a solution on all fronts and to work with producers to that end.\n              Today, producers have repeatedly said that, in their opinion, this crisis has a significant political dimension. For that reason, one would expect the committee to be able to hear from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n              Mr. Chair, I am truly disappointed in your decision. I am sure the motion I presented today is not identical to the one I submitted before. Initially, our motion called for three ministers to appear. You rejected it. For three ministers, I quite agree. However, the thing to do now would be to invite the two ministers involved, who came up in today's evidence. I take it from this that the Liberal government does not intend to make any further effort to gather all of the information on this situation.\n              Thank you."}, {"turn": 83, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Berthold.\n              Mr. Breton, you have six minutes."}, {"turn": 84, "speakerID": "216089", "name": "Mr. Pierre Breton", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n              I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, Mr. Poissant.\n              We are seeking solutions on the canola crisis matter. In recent weeks, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development.\n              Currently, Ms. Bibeau, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, is working extremely hard and in close collaboration with the industry to manage this issue.

At least, that is what Mr. Van Tassel said, if I am not mistaken. I don't know what Mr. Murray's situation is.\n              How do the current restrictions on canola exports to China affect your stock and liquidity?\n              Do the Agri-Stability and Agri-Invest programs tools address the problems that you may be experiencing?"}, {"turn": 85, "speakerID": "103883", "name": "Mr. William Van Tassel", "contribution": "Personally, I do a four-year rotation. One reason is to avoid diseases that attack grains, particularly fusariosis. One year, I grow canola, another year, I grow soy beans and, between the two, I grow other grains. Like producers all across Canada, I try to follow the best cycle possible to minimize disease.\n              As for the way the current situation is affecting me, I will say that, normally, the level of canola in my silos is starting to get low, with almost no stock left. But it's surprising, but there is still some left at the moment and this creates a liquidity crisis. It started before last February or March. In fact, it is tied to the tariffs that the Chinese placed on American soy beans. The prices started to drop in May of last year. This drop affected soy beans, then canola. As a producer, I'm affected, given that canola covers 25% of the land that I farm and that soy beans cover another 25%. In both cases, the prices have dropped.\n              I will give you an example. Under the contracts that I signed for the 2018 crops, before these crises started, I was selling canola for between $500 and $507 a ton. Currently, I'm being offered between $430 and $440 a ton. For the same 2018 harvest, that is a drop of $60 to $70 per ton. For soy beans, the situation is less pronounced, but the amounts are similar.\n              As for the Agri-Invest Program, we're talking about 1% of the eligible net sales. Therefore, the lower our sales are, the less support we receive from Agri-Invest. We are using our reserves. This program does not really address the problem. We become eligible for the Agri-Stability Program when losses reach 30%. I believe that 30% of Canadian producers have used that program, which we sometimes call “Agri-Disaster”."}, {"turn": 86, "speakerID": "216089", "name": "Mr. Pierre Breton", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              I don't know if you wanted to add something, Mr. Murray.

I made a few sales during this time, but there is a limit to what we can sell, because we need to ensure that we have stocks in reserve. Last May, because the prices started dropping, I slowed my sales a bit. My sales can be spread out over 12 months, or even nearly 16 months, as was the case for 2018.\n              Some of my sales were at a good price.

I was at the Standing Committee on International Trade last week with Minister Carr and Minister Bibeau. We had our one hour. But Chair, and Liberal colleagues, I think what's very clear is that this is an evolving issue and we need all hands on deck. We absolutely have to look at inviting a minister. If ministers are so sure of their policies and what they are doing and they are doing everything possible, surely they can come before this committee and defend their policies. We absolutely must consider that at some point. \n              I just want to put on the record that it's April 9, 2019, and the last time we had a minister before this committee was November 29. We absolutely need to have someone.\n              Ms. Reynolds, I have a quick question for you. You gave some great testimony during our mental health study. I was looking over that testimony.

We should have had someone in China at that point working on our trade agreement, so that we didn't get to here. \n              Moving forward I would like to ask what we are going to do to mitigate these risks.
