I know we attempted on two or three other occasions to fit schedules and we weren't successful, so we do appreciate your appearance today. I think you understand how the committee works. We'll have an opening statement from you, followed by a series of questions by committee members. Without further ado, Madam Smart, the floor is yours."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "221765", "name": "Ms. Anne Marie Smart (Chief Human Resources Officer, Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer, Treasury Board Secretariat)", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you for inviting me here today as part of the committee's important legislative review of the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act. As you may know, this act is an important part of the Government of Canada's integrity framework and we take it quite seriously. We feel that integrity is the cornerstone of good governance and democracy. By upholding the highest ethical standards, public servants safeguard and enhance public confidence in the honesty, fairness, and impartiality of the federal public sector. To this end, the act sets out the measures to promote an ethical climate. It establishes the foundation to promote a culture of right-doing and a positive ethical climate through measures such as the creation of the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector, which applies to some crown corporations, separate agencies, and the core public administration. The code, along with the organizational codes of conduct, describe for public servants at all levels the values and ethical practices that guide direction, decision-making, and behaviour across the public sector.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe act also encourages employees in the public sector to come forward if they have reason to believe that serious wrongdoing has taken place, and it provides protections for employees against reprisal when they do so.The act therefore addresses issues that are both complicated and highly sensitive in nature, with the result that the legislation itself is complex.That said, I would welcome any proposals your committee might make to simplify this legislation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo date, I've read the testimony. I know your committee has heard testimony from a very diverse group of witnesses and I think you should be commended for considering such a wide variety of perspectives.The challenge before your committee as it weighs the evidence is a very important one, and I'm very much looking forward to your committee's recommendations for improving the legislation and how it functions. I recognize that there are areas where the act could be improved. It has been in place now for almost 10 years. It is to be expected that, during this time, issues in its administration, the mechanics of its procedures, or in the scope of what the legislation covers would become evident and I think you've found a few.For example, it has become apparent that it is important to protect not just the discloser, but others who may be associated with the case, even if that association is mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Chair, I also agree that the legislation should make it as easy as possible for someone to come forward and to be protected when they do.Options might include simpler and more direct access to the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal, or the implementation of a reverse onus for the employer to prove that no reprisal has taken place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is worth noting that several witnesses have also echoed the importance of having different disclosure channels available. Several technical recommendations have also been brought forward by the stakeholders you've heard from to address some of the specific areas of the act as it now stands.Another issue to be considered is whether there is sufficient direction in the legislation around the investigation process for internal disclosures and perhaps how these investigations might be appropriately related to the disciplinary investigations of individual wrongdoers. I think this legislative review also represents an opportunity for clarification of the interplay between this act and other legislation, such as the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act. It would also be useful for the committee to consider these matters with a view to balancing the protection of the discloser with the rights of the accused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI've also followed with interest the testimony of witnesses from several international jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction's regime has its strengths and weaknesses. I would certainly welcome your advice on how to apply the many lessons learned in these other jurisdictions to find solutions that will work in the Canadian context.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor example, I believe further efforts are required to raise awareness of the act and the system currently in place. This includes an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of employees, supervisors and deputy heads, and of the resources available to employees should they wish to disclose a wrongdoing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese include the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner and the organization's designated senior officer for disclosure.Mr. Chair, the Government of Canada is committed to promoting a positive and respectful public sector culture that is grounded in values and ethics. As I said in my introduction, I believe that a well-functioning disclosure regime plays a very vital role in such a culture.For my part, I very much look forward to your recommendations for ways to improve this important piece of legislation and I will take it very seriously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThank you."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Madam Smart.We'll start with our seven-minute round, and I will remind all committee members that these proceedings are televised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Ayoub, you have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "215939", "name": "Mr. Ramez Ayoub (Thérèse-De Blainville, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.I want to thank the two witnesses for being here today.I'll start by asking a question to clarify an answer that we may have already received. I'll ask you the question right away, so that I don't forget it.Some witnesses have suggested that we let the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada take corrective action when wrongdoing is found. However, the act doesn't aim to replace other mechanisms or processes set out by different legislation or collective agreements, such as criminal proceedings under the Criminal Code, grievance procedures or harassment complaint processes. A possible alternative is to allow for the use of the information gathered in an Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada investigation during the disciplinary procedures carried out pursuant to the Public Service Labour Relations Act when wrongdoing is found.What's the current discipline system? What do you think of this proposal?"}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "221765", "name": "Ms. Anne Marie Smart", "contribution": "Thank you for the question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf there's a wrongdoing found, I know that sometimes the commissioner can make some suggestions for where to look for discipline, but it's up to the deputy head. The deputy heads at my level are accountable in the public service for discipline and for managing the human resources within a department. The deputy heads, in those cases where wrongdoing is found, do immediately start looking at possible discipline. In some cases they may hire a third party to look at what should be done. When I was reading your committee's testimony, I noted that it's one of the areas where oftentimes the deputy head has to start all over again with a separate investigation and can't use the investigation that's been done by the commissioner into wrongdoing. If that could be made available to the deputy head for the investigation, I think it would certainly help facilitate proper discipline.They have a wide range of mechanisms available to them. If the deputy head, for example, thinks that they could be in some kind of conflict, they can also ask another department or somebody to look into the discipline for them. There are various mechanisms that exist, but it is the deputy head who does the report."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "215939", "name": "Mr. Ramez Ayoub", "contribution": "Mr. Trottier, do you have anything to add?"}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "228427", "name": "Mr. Carl Trottier (Assistant Deputy Minister, Governance, Planning and Policy Sector, Treasury Board Secretariat)", "contribution": "No."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "215939", "name": "Mr. Ramez Ayoub", "contribution": "Let's talk about the current discipline system.

Others, for whatever reason, choose to go to the commissioner. I think that they should have that range of choice.If they're not feeling comfortable within the department or the ministry, I think that having the arm's-length commissioner is a good thing.

This isn't about prevention when the whistle-blower is coming forward. It's about actual, identified wrongdoing of an extremely serious nature. To circle the wagons and protect— we don't want to be too tough on the wrongdoer—boggles the mind of normal Canadians, who think that if this happened in the public sector someone would go to the police, and the police would investigate, and there would be a public hearing, and, rightfully, the people would be named. And they should be shamed because they have specifically endangered the lives and the health of persons or they have grossly mismanaged the public sector funds or they've contravened an Act of Parliament.

It was very difficult.You talked about various ways to proceed when making a disclosure. I started out by going through the internal channels and turned to people who were higher in the organizational structure. It did not work at all, as they did not think it was a problem. They even threatened me. They told me that if I made unfounded allegations again, it would not work. You talked about the possibility of an independent person investigating. That would be much better, as people protect each other when internal channels are used. They are all colleagues and they protect each other. So there is a sort of a cover-up. I was told that there was no problem.I then suffered major reprisal in my workplace. I was ostracized, and no one wanted to talk to me. They also started questioning the way I worked. Nothing I was doing was right. If I took a five-minute break like everyone else, they would say that I had taken 10 minutes. I was really hounded, and all my actions were scrutinized and questioned. It was very difficult.When it comes to using internal channels, anonymity is important because, at the end of the day, those who commit wrongdoings are often in positions of power. They are often high-ranking officials. So if we are under those people, we suffer a great deal. We are put through the ringer, as they say. In any case, that was my experience.I then went to the union representatives, who told me that the only way to proceed was to file grievances.Do you know that it was employment insurance quotas I disclosed?"}, {"turn": 216, "speakerID": "215939", "name": "Mr. Ramez Ayoub", "contribution": "Yes, I do."}, {"turn": 217, "speakerID": "230600", "name": "Ms. Sylvie Therrien", "contribution": "Okay. So I don't need to come back to that.I was told that the only way to proceed was to go through the grievance process. That is what I did. Fortunately, I had Mr. Yazbeck to help me, as the experience was horrible. I went through two years of hearings and so forth. It was very difficult. Hearing horrible things said about me severely affected me on a psychological level. The employer has a lot of resource, doesn't it? It has a lot of our resources. It has many lawyers and a host of people whose goal is to find all sorts of flaws, to destroy us and our reputation. That is what the employer does.The hearing with the grievance arbitrator was terrible. The process lasted two years. He concluded that, as the issue did not fall under his jurisdiction, he could not render a decision.I also turned to the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada. In the beginning, I was told that the organization was there to protect whistleblowers. But the process was very complicated. I had to fill out forms, and everything was so complex.At first, people didn't really know what it was about. I didn't know that there was an integrity commissioner. When I finally filed a complaint, I was told that too many weeks had passed, and the complaint was inadmissible.Fortunately, Mr. Yazbeck was there. Thanks to his knowledge, he resubmitted my complaint to the integrity commissioner, and it was accepted.Finally, they decided that the fact that I had lost my job and my security clearance and was suspended without pay did not constitute reprisal. Yet that was the important point I wanted to make—that the government, in reprisal, had fired me to shut me up. It used my example to deter other whistleblowers who may have wanted to talk. I was a good example of what shouldn't be done.I have said a lot already. I don't know whether I should continue.I am now in limbo, sitting on the fence. On the one hand, the arbitrator does not want to make a decision because the matter supposedly does not come under his jurisdiction; on the other hand, Mr. Friday is waiting for the arbitrator to render his decision. We almost wonder whether they are talking to each other to make my case slip through the cracks and ensure that it will not be resolved. One is waiting for the other to make a decision, and finally nothing happens.On the one hand, I am asking this committee to review the act and the policies in order to properly protect whistleblowers. The statutes must focus on the whistleblower. It is very important to protect whistleblowers, and not to protect those who are already in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, I am wondering whether your committee could, in some way, tell Mr. Friday that he does not have a choice, that he must refer my case to the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal, since the situation is ridiculous and there is no need to wait anymore. Your action would very clearly indicate that you defend whistleblowers. Your committee would show that it is serious about this issue. It would show that your committee does not just talk, receive briefs and produce reports. It would be a move that would say a lot.Then the act should be reviewed. It's not just for me. It's true that it would help me, as personal consequences were huge in my case. I am no longer employable, I have no money and I am in debt.

He would send us report cards to congratulate us on our good work, as we had saved a certain amount of money for the government, and he would tell us that we had to increase the savings achieved in employment insurance to $500,000. Those report cards clearly indicated what was expected of us. Each investigator had to achieve savings of $40,000 a month, or $485,000 a year. It was very clear.As it was the end of the fiscal year and they wanted us to save a great deal of money quickly before the year was out, we received weekly emails reminding us to identify cases involving penalties or violations. We were told that, if we found any such cases, we had to send the information as soon as possible, so that it would be recorded before the end of the fiscal year. It was a race for savings. It no longer had anything to do with a service we provide to Canadians who apply for employment insurance.

But in this particular case, I can tell you that the evidence and the argument before the adjudicator did not rely on an allegation of reprisal at all. There's no dispute about that. So to me, the commissioner could have taken this up, because his original decision was that the reprisal was being dealt with in the adjudication so he didn't have to deal with it now.

I have a good lawyer and it's fantastic, but why should it be like that? Part of it is because you're persecuted as soon as you make an allegation of wrongdoing, so you need a legal representative to defend you, but it shouldn't be so adversarial. They should have been investigating all the money they spent on trying to find who leaked the document to the press, and this and that. They could have investigated if there was quota and if it's true that the claimants didn't receive the EI money that they were supposed to receive. They should maybe investigate if what I was alleging was true or not. That could have been a better place to put taxpayer money, I think."}, {"turn": 289, "speakerID": "219364", "name": "Mr. Erin Weir", "contribution": "Mr. Yazbeck, you have testified before, but I did want to give you another opportunity, if there were some particular reforms or proposals you want to put on the table for us to consider."}, {"turn": 290, "speakerID": "229788", "name": "Mr. David Yazbeck", "contribution": "I don't want to repeat what I've said before and waste the committee's time, but something did come up earlier this evening when there were questions about the definition of wrongdoing.

I don't necessarily think that would always be the case. Sometimes you need to have incentives put in place to motivate workers. It doesn't always necessarily mean that if you have incentives there is going to be malfeasance. However, I think there is a reasonable apprehension here. So rather than focus on the specifics of this case, Mr. Yazbeck, when we're talking about disclosures, do we need to broaden the definition of to whom and to where we disclose the information and lower the good faith burden? It would be just whether the documents on their face might cause a reasonable person to believe that something is going wrong and is worth looking into."}, {"turn": 293, "speakerID": "229788", "name": "Mr. David Yazbeck", "contribution": "I would agree with that.I think there is difficulty in relying on the good faith obligation. I'm not condoning bad faith disclosures, but oftentimes people think of good faith as having, for example, a proper motivation. So if somebody is disclosing something because they want to get back at their supervisor, that's going to be bad faith and we don't want to deal with that disclosure. However, it could very well be that the supervisor was engaged in wrongdoing as well. Simply because there's some animus there on behalf of the discloser, that shouldn't disqualify that complaint. I do think we have to be careful with that. I also think that, historically, in cases where people have gone public and they have been disciplined, the employer has often taken the position that you can't disclose wrongdoing unless you know the allegations to be true, the proof of truth requirement. That's going way too far, because sometimes you don't know and you can't know. Sometimes you just have a suspicion and want somebody to investigate to make sure whether it's true. Frankly, that's the whole role of the commissioner. If somebody has a suspicion, that should be sufficient, as long as it's reasonable and they're not acting in bad faith."}, {"turn": 294, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "Mr. Yazbeck, I saw one of the articles about this particular case.

I'm not sure how a court would approach that. Certainly, it would be the civil burden of proof—right?—the balance of probabilities, etc. If you are proving reprisal, it's the same burden of proof. It's a balance of probabilities. The problem with reprisals is that you start with a proposition that the act in question is legitimate and then you have to prove otherwise, and that puts a heavy burden on the complainant, whereas in the case you're talking about, there's a standard out there that's applicable to the respondent or the defendant. In a way it almost shifts the burden, so to speak, because we're looking at whether they complied with that standard.When I think it through, I guess in that sense it might be easier. I just think that the nature of reprisal as an insidious, difficult thing in the workplace is uniquely suited to an expert investigator, an expert decision-maker, or an expert tribunal to deal with, as opposed to a court dealing with a more general duty on behalf of somebody vis-à-vis a complainant or employee. I think the need for expertise in this area is crucial.
