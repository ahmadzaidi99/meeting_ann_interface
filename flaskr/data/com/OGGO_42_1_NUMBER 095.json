Before we begin, I have just a couple of quick notes. We may be interrupted by bells this morning. I'm not 100% sure on that, but I have a sense that we'll probably hear the bells ringing at about a quarter after 10 or so. Since we're next door to the chamber, if we still have questions of our guests, we have the ability to stick around here a little longer rather than just leave immediately when the bells start ringing. I'll do a little consensus building at that time and see what we need to do.\n              Since this will be in all probability our last meeting before the summer, I want to thank each and every one of you for all the hard work you've performed on behalf of Canadians and your own taxpayers. I particularly want to acknowledge all the hard work you did with our most recent report, which we tabled last week, on the whistle-blower protection act. We hadn't had a report like that for 10 years, as all of you know. I have heard, as I'm sure you have heard from many of your constituents and many public service holders themselves, that an update of that act was desperately needed. We had many, many government employees and public servants who were feeling shut out of the process. They felt that they couldn't really go forward to their supervisors, in some cases, with evidence or suggestions of wrongdoing, for fear of reprisal. I think the work you all did on drafting that report, which we've tabled, will go a long way in comforting a lot of our public servants and in fact encouraging them to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing, should they see it in the workplace.\n              This is, I think, a very memorable—I won't say “historic”, as I'm not prone to hyperbole—and good piece of work that all of you did. I give my thanks to each and every one of you for that. It's going to stand the test of time, I believe. We'll see what happens in five years when we do another review. Congratulations to each and every one of you. You should be proud of the work you did.\n              Colleagues, I also just want to mention to you that our clerk, Philippe, will not be with us come the fall. This is his last meeting. It's been 18 months since this committee began sitting, and I think we will now be going through our fourth clerk, which I take as a direct reflection of my abilities as your chair.\n              \n                Some hon. members: Oh, oh!"}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "224996", "name": "Mrs. Brenda Shanahan (Châteauguay—Lacolle, Lib.)", "contribution": "Is it us?"}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "It kind reminds me of my love life when I was younger, when the woman always used to say, “It's not you, it's me.

I know we all wish him well.\n              Thank you for all of the hard work you've done.\n              \n                Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\n              \n                The Chair: Of course, I will never ignore, and nor should I, our two hard-working analysts. Both Audrey and Raphaëlle have done exemplary work over the course of the last several months. Frankly, without them, we wouldn't be tabling reports in the House of Commons as comprehensively as we have been. \n              Ladies, thank you very, very much for all your work.\n              \n                Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\n              \n                The Chair: With that, Monsieur Fréchette, we will have your opening statement.

Should Bill C-44 be passed in the next few hours, all of the PBO team members are looking forward to working with your committee, which is one of the four committees mentioned in the PBO legislation. We're looking forward to that.\n              \n              Mr. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair, members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation to appear before you to discuss the estimates process and our recent reports on the estimates.\n              Today, I am joined by Mostafa Askari, Assistant Parliamentary Budget Officer, and by Jason Jacques and Alex Smith. I feel that Mr. Jacques and Mr. Smith are members of quite a small group of experts who have been following the evolution of the budget process for many years.\n              \n              Of course, I include in that group Brian Pagan and his colleague Marcia Santiago, who are both not unknown to your committee.\n              \n              As you know, in October 2016, the Treasury Board Secretariat released its vision for estimates reform. It rests on four pillars: aligning the estimates with the budget, scope and accounting, vote structure, and finally, the departmental plans and results reports. \n              \n              We welcome the government's efforts to enhance Parliament's role in financial scrutiny. To help parliamentarians examine the government's proposals, we prepared a document outlining issues to be considered when reforming the business of supply. We have also been monitoring the implementation of the government's reforms through our reports on the estimates. While we have observations on each of the four pillars, I will focus on the government's proposal to improve the alignment of the budget and the main estimates by delaying the main estimates—originally until May 1, and now until April 16 based on a recent motion that would amend Standing Order 81. We will come back to that standing order during the question period, if you want.\n              As the inclusion of budget measures in the spring estimates is an indication of whether delaying the main estimates will lead to alignment with the budget, we tracked the number and value of budget 2017 spending measures in supplementary estimates  2017-18. We found that only 44% of the additional funding allocated in budget 2017 for 2017-18 was included in the supplementary estimates . This is a decrease from the previous year, when 70% of the budget funding was included in supplementary s 2016-17.\n              Given the limited number and value of budget measures that were included in supplementary estimates  2017-18, we are concerned that the government's proposal to delay the main estimates may not result in meaningful improvement in the alignment of the budget and the main estimates.\n              \n              \n              It is worth noting that, in 2008, the government began tabling spring supplementary estimates with the stated intention of facilitating a closer alignment of the estimates to the budget. As the number of budget measures included in the spring supplementary estimates has varied considerably, it could be concluded that delaying the main estimates would result in similar challenges.\n              Our examination suggests that successfully aligning the budget and the estimates will require substantial reforms to Finance Canada's and the Treasury Board Secretariat's budgetary approval processes. Thus, parliamentarians may wish to wait for additional details regarding the government's plans to streamline and align those processes before changing the timing of the main estimates.\n              To help parliamentarians hold the government to account for the implementation of its budget plan, we also decided to track spending and tax measures from announcement in the budget to parliamentary approval through appropriation and budget implementation bills.\n              As a result of that exercise, we found a number of budget 2016 spending measures, 44% of them, line up with items included in the 2016-17 supplementary estimates. However, many spending measures had more funding or less funding than indicated in the budget, or were simply not funded through the supplementary estimates in 2016-17.\n              \n              On that basis, we concluded that there is often no clear line of sight between budget spending announcements and their implementation. The different presentation, wording, and accounting methodology makes it challenging to align budget spending measures with items included in the estimates, and it is not possible to track spending on most budget measures beyond the first year or what was actually spent on specific measures. It is thus very difficult for parliamentarians to follow the money and hold the government to account for implementing its fiscal plan as outlined in the budget. \n              We believe that the government may be able to address some of these challenges by preparing and presenting its budget and estimates concurrently and using a more consistent method of presentation, as was recommended by this committee in 2012.\n              \n              We have provided copies of the documents I have mentioned to the clerk.\n              My colleagues and I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have regarding our analyses, as well as the government's estimates process.\n              \n              Thank you very much, Mr. Chair."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Monsieur Fréchette.\n              We'll start our seven-minute round of questioning with Mr. Peterson."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson (Newmarket—Aurora, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n              Thank you, Monsieur Fréchette, for being with us this morning.\n              Your report here looks at just the one fiscal year, correct?

Is there a problem with getting the proper authority to spend through the supplementary estimates process as opposed to the main estimates?"}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "I don't think it's a problem with the supplementary estimates; it's a problem with the main estimates. The 44% that you mentioned is interesting, because it was the following year: this year. Last year, in the main estimates, you could see 70% of the spending measures included. The reason is simple; it was a big chunk of money under the infrastructure program. It was easier for the government and Treasury Board to include it in supplementary estimates  following the budget. It was not the case the following year, because the infrastructure program was not there anymore, and therefore all these smaller programs and all that were more difficult. \n              The problem is the beginning of the fiscal year following the budget, with the supplementary estimates , where you're supposed to have most of the expenditures that were not in the main estimates."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Okay.\n              The Treasury Board president, Minister Brison, has appeared before this committee on a number of occasions, and he has agreed and admitted that the first step toward improving these processes would be to get the alignment right. I think he referred to it as the “sequencing”. The government has now proposed moving the tabling of the main estimates to April 16 or 18, I think. That will obviously have consequences. The machinery of government will have to change and improve alignment between the budget and the estimates.\n              Do you agree with his assessment?"}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "We said in our report analysis that this move from the President of the Treasury Board was laudable. We still mention that. We welcome that. We welcome that for parliamentarians. We work for parliamentarians. But we have some restrictions, or when we observe and then we make the analysis as we did and follow the money document, we can see that it's going to be very difficult. You're talking about the sequencing. We still have to see this sequencing. \n              It's not by changing the standing order to April 16. Maybe it will help a little bit to give an additional two or three weeks to Treasury Board to make the alignment, but we're not convinced that it will be sufficient. Is it an incentive for Finance Canada and Treasury Board to work more collaboratively, or in better collaboration? We're not convinced of that. \n              I don't know if Jason wants to add something on this."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "221434", "name": "Mr. Jason Jacques (Director, Economic and Fiscal Analysis, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Library of Parliament)", "contribution": "I think the only observation we would make, going back to Jean-Denis' opening statement, is that the government attempted to do precisely this in 2007 and 2008 with the creation of the spring supplementary estimates . Largely it's been a failure over the past 10 years. We've asked where the plan is, how are they actually going to implement things differently in comparison to the past and address those failures, but nothing has been forthcoming at this point.\n              The only other observation I'd make is that if Minister Brison and Minister Morneau cannot currently direct their officials to work together more effectively, I think there's an open question regarding to what extent Parliament is in a good position to place additional pressure on those two government departments."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Do you see as part of the problem, then, that Finance and Treasury Board are not working in alignment, in conjunction?"}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "221434", "name": "Mr. Jason Jacques", "contribution": "That's precisely the observation we made, and have been making over the past eight months, that the problem does not rest within Parliament but rather within the government and within the public service itself.

There is a performance architecture within the government. They are always trying to improve that. What we have observed in the past is that the way that was managed and the information that was provided was not very useful. We did a study a couple of years ago, in which we looked at the performance indicators. We tried to figure out how they are being used, and whether there is any link between those performance indicators and the changes in expenditures for various programs. We couldn't find any link between those two. We saw that programs that were not actually performing well were given more money, and programs that were performing really well saw their budget reduced.\n              So it wasn't really clear how the government was using the indicators. Right now they are trying to improve that, and we have to see if it is a better system. Certainly that would be welcome."}, {"turn": 17, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Okay.\n              How's my time, Mr. Chair?"}, {"turn": 18, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "You have a little less than a minute."}, {"turn": 19, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Okay.\n              I read your report, and in one of the tables was a comparison to other jurisdictions.

It is an honour to meet you and your team. Thank you for joining us this morning.\n              Last fall, in 2016, we debated some reforms of the main estimates a little. We did so without focusing on whether the figures or the accounting methods were exact and without discussing all those questions of a technical nature. Instead, from a more philosophic perspective, we spent time discussing whether the reforms would actually reduce the time allocated to members to scrutinize government spending in depth. \n              In your opinion, if these reforms were adopted, would that actually reduce the time allowed to scrutinize the expenditures?"}, {"turn": 24, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "Thank you for the question. The answer comes in two parts.\n              First, we all know that your time is limited. So, if the documents are clearer and easier to understand, and if the figures in the budget and the main estimates are better aligned and better organized, clearly, your examination of them will be made easier, and consulting the documents from end to end will be quicker. \n              Second, according to the proposed changes—you are referring to those that are the result of the reforms and probably to those regarding the Standing Orders of the House—the amount of time you have is still being increased. Even if you put the tabling of the main estimates back to April 16, parliamentarians still have more time, up to June 10, to examine them. \n              That is certainly enough time if the documents do indeed turn out to be clearer, plainer and easier to understand. As I said, if we, as experts who have been observing the budget process for years, have difficulty in finding figures ourselves, we can understand how difficult it can be. Any reform proposal that clarifies the process is clearly welcome."}, {"turn": 25, "speakerID": "226913", "name": "Mr. Alupa Clarke", "contribution": "Right.\n              On the third page of your document, you say: “the government may be able to address some of these challenges by preparing and presenting its budget and estimates concurrently…”\n              What exactly do you mean? Does concurrently mean on the same day and with the same figures? Is that what you mean?"}, {"turn": 26, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "And with the same accounting, yes.\n              That was a recommendation of the committee in 2012. As I explained, it is what happens in other countries. The difficulty is that I am not convinced that it can be done and I refer specifically to 2012. That is when senior officials said that the main estimates and the budget could never be aligned, for various reasons, such as accounting, financial year and cash flow, but also because of the amounts of the spending. They said that we would always need supplementary estimates in order to align some expenditures, and we agree on that.\n              That is why alignment could be extremely difficult if there is no change of culture inside the public service itself in terms of providing data. We will not achieve that by changing the Standing Orders of the House. I do not see what incentive there would be, especially as that change is for two years. It goes to the end of the current, 42nd Parliament, unlike other regulations that, once changed, stay changed forever—accepting that nothing is really forever. However, in this case, it is a trial run for two years. So it has to be seen as a pilot project."}, {"turn": 27, "speakerID": "226913", "name": "Mr. Alupa Clarke", "contribution": "Yes, in Australia, when changes were made to align the budgets, it seems to me that it was done immediately, was it not? They did not take two or three years to conduct pilot projects."}, {"turn": 28, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "Jason, on Australia...?"}, {"turn": 29, "speakerID": "221434", "name": "Mr. Jason Jacques", "contribution": "Sure.\n              In the specific case of Australia, many years of work were undertaken leading up to that alignment. To highlight the point that the President of the Treasury Board and Mr. Pagan made in the past at this table, and that we've also made, it is a complex undertaking, but again, it's an undertaking that primarily starts within the public service. It's alignment within the public service, government departments, and especially central agencies working very closely together to ensure that the documents that can be furnished to parliamentarians and upon which they're voting are well aligned and very well integrated. It does require a tremendous amount of internal work and machinery changes within the public service."}, {"turn": 30, "speakerID": "226913", "name": "Mr. Alupa Clarke", "contribution": "Mr. Fréchette, I will let you have the floor for the two final minutes, so that you can make any comments."}, {"turn": 31, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "Thank you, but I have no further comments, except to repeat that we find the approach very commendable in trying to harmonize the estimates and providing parliamentarians with clearer documents. I want to be very clear on that. In the budget process, it is your role to approve those sums of money. In order to do that, you need clear documents that are easily understood in a short time. That is my main comment.\n              However, as Mr. Jacques and I mentioned, It is currently difficult to take such an approach in the public service and the two central organizations. We hope that the reform will result in the main estimates being presented a little later, and that it will bring about better alignment.\n              Based on our analyses of the last two years—I am not giving you an opinion of mine—70% of the funding proposed in the budget was accounted for in the 2016-2017 supplementary estimates . That was easier, because it was about overall infrastructure programs. This year, it is more difficult because it is about individual programs. So the performance of the departments has to be a factor."}, {"turn": 32, "speakerID": "226913", "name": "Mr. Alupa Clarke", "contribution": "Right.\n              I have one final question.\n              Is the alignment of the budget and the supplementary estimates designed to improve the management of the public purse or to make the documents easier to study in committee and for the public and MPs to understand? Basically, we have been operating in this way since 1867. I feel that Canada is a fantastic, rich country anyway. We all agree that it is a great democracy. \n              Is the goal of the reform to manage an internal process on Parliament Hill or is it really to improve the management of the public purse?"}, {"turn": 33, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "I would say—"}, {"turn": 34, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Monsieur Fréchette, I know that your answer will be a little more comprehensive than perhaps we have time to allow, so I will ask you to keep your thoughts.

As you mentioned, last week the government put forward a motion in Parliament allowing it to table main estimates as late as April 16 as opposed to March 1. The downside of this proposal is that it reduces the time available to parliamentarians to scrutinize the main estimates. The potential upside is that it allows more time for better alignment between the main estimates and the budget. \n              I'm looking for your assessment of whether this proposal will achieve that goal."}, {"turn": 36, "speakerID": "198569", "name": "Mr. Jean-Denis Fréchette", "contribution": "My assessment is that we won't have the choice; we will see. As I said, it's clearly a pilot project. We will see next year how parliamentarians will react to that. Mostafa might want to add something to that. \n              We have views, but I'm a very positive person. As I said, you will also have more time at the end because the deemed reporting to Parliament will be pushed to later in June. It will give you some time. If the documents are clear and easier to understand, maybe for you it will be preferable.\n              Mostafa."}, {"turn": 37, "speakerID": "210927", "name": "Mr. Mostafa Askari", "contribution": "It gives the government between two and six weeks of extra time, essentially, because the budget date is not fixed, so we don't know when the government will actually table the budget. It could be the beginning of March, it could be the end of March, it could be in April. We don't really know how much extra time the government will get with this proposal.\n              The other part that has already been mentioned is that the problem really is not the date of the main estimates; the problem is the internal processes for the Treasury Board to approve the various budget measures. Based on the report from the government, those could take up to 18 months. If that's the case, then four or five weeks or two weeks of extra time will not help the government to include most of the budget measures into the main estimates.\n              Another problem with this proposal is that you are going to lose the supplementary estimates , which are normally tabled in the month of May. What that means is that you will see most of the budget measures in the estimates only in November, when the first supplementary estimate is tabled. \n              It's not clear this is actually an improvement relative to the current system in terms of the alignment between the budget and the main estimates. What you need, really.... The test is very simple for every kind of measure that is proposed by the government in this regard—namely, is this going to increase the capacity of parliamentarians to hold the government to account and scrutinize their spending? Based on our evaluation, this proposal is not going to do that. Again, the problem is not the date; the problem is the internal processes. The Treasury Board submission process is completely separate from the cabinet process for approval of the budget measures, so when you get the budget approved, then you have to start the Treasury Board process, which will take up to 18 months. That's why we don't see the budget measures included in the main estimates."}, {"turn": 38, "speakerID": "219364", "name": "Mr. Erin Weir", "contribution": "We're all in the position of having to vote on this proposal very soon.

You know, this is their choice, but the problem is that when you fix the main estimates date but not the budget date, then you don't really have much room to play with, because you don't know when the budget is going to be tabled.

I have familiarized myself with the document that was sent to us. It is called “Following the Dollar—Tracking Budget 2016 Spending and Tax Measures”. It is an interesting document.

This document is a good example of something that can help parliamentarians to better grasp the difficulties that they have to resolve when they are looking at the budget process.\n              As Mr. Askari mentioned, it is not just a question of examining the budget process from the figures that you see in the main estimates or the budget. It is also important to clarify all the steps. It starts somewhere, meaning that an amount that appears in the main estimates has first been argued over in cabinet, then in the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board, not to mention in the approval stage.\n              In fact, we can see that amounts mentioned in the federal budget do not necessarily appear in the main estimates. They may only appear in the supplementary estimates. We have given the committee some examples.

That will certainly give you information of another kind, but there is still a large grey area where you will not have all the details of all the programs.\n              The argument is that you are going to go from 300 or 240 votes to 1,200.

It's the exact same debate that the current secretary, Mr. Pagan, mentioned before your committee.

I think we could make a good match with these."}, {"turn": 84, "speakerID": "232627", "name": "Mr. Alex Smith", "contribution": "Well, there's a need to strike a balance between parliamentary control and government flexibility. For the government, they need to be able to make changes throughout the year and not have to come to Parliament every time they want to make a change. When you have a vote for Parliament, they cannot exceed that. It is a limit on how much they can spend. If you break that spending out into further categories and more categories, they have to be more careful about how they spend their money, and they need to have very thorough accounting systems.\n               Right now their accounting systems are not robust enough to make sure that they do not exceed a vote if you give them, say, 10 or 12 categories of their spending within a particular organization. That is why, to some extent, the government prefers the current method, because there are overall categories of expenditure by capital, by operating, or by grants and contributions.\n               The motivation of this committee in 2012 was that when you vote on a grants and contributions, or a capital, or an operating, it really doesn't say a lot to a parliamentarian: “I'm more interested in what you're going to achieve with the funding.” If you have a vote based on the results or objectives that the government is going to achieve, it's more meaningful to parliamentarians. If you want to affect the amount that is spent, are you really interested in reducing the amount that is spent on capital? Or are you interested in the amount that's going to be spent on rail safety as opposed to highway safety, other marine safety, or other things that a department might be interested in, and seeing how the funds are organized in that way?\n              The challenge for the government is that if you have to come forward every time you want to move funds around between these votes to Parliament, it can make it difficult to respond to emerging issues during the year. That's why in some jurisdictions—and as they put in their discussion paper—you could have a system whereby government can move up to a certain percentage of the vote without coming back to Parliament.\n              There are various ways in which you can accommodate these things.

You might see a larger amount for some departments and some organizations, so you could ask questions such as why they are spending more than three-twelfths in these interim estimates."}, {"turn": 164, "speakerID": "219364", "name": "Mr. Erin Weir", "contribution": "Fair enough.\n              You mentioned the advantages of presenting the budget well before the start of the fiscal year, and of course, as we've already discussed, that was one of our committee's recommendations back in 2012.

If you are able to present things and implement them earlier in the fiscal year, it's easier. If you have to wait until December to get parliamentary approval to spend money, you have three months left to spend the money.\n              With respect to provinces, most of the transfers are under statutory authority and don't go through the estimates, so that particular thing might be less affected, but non-governmental organizations and first nations communities get money well into the fiscal year.

But let's imagine that the government succeeded in including 100% of budget measures in the main estimates.

I'm sorry; I was wrong there. \n              The problem is that right now you have more time, but the main estimates don't include anything from the budget, so there isn't really much to discuss. You have to wait for the supplementary estimates to come out to really do your scrutiny and the due diligence.

One solution in 2012 was to move the budget date back, and then you would have most of the measures included in the main estimates from the end of February to early June, and you will have time to look at the main estimates, but that's obviously not part of the plan."}, {"turn": 174, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              Madam Shanahan, you have seven minutes."}, {"turn": 175, "speakerID": "224996", "name": "Mrs. Brenda Shanahan", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, I'd like to give my time to my colleague Mr. Whalen.\n              \n                The Chair: Certainly.\n              Mr. Whalen."}, {"turn": 176, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "Thank you, Ms. Shanahan, and thanks, Mr. Chair.\n              I might disagree with the last statement that obviously it's not part of the plan, because the President of the Treasury Board has been before us.

However, the proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating as to whether Mr. Brison, Treasury Board, and Finance achieve the goals they've set for themselves. Obviously, not all the intricacies of the goals have been laid out before us, but the four-pillar plan, the 2012 recommendations, and Mr. Brison's extensive consultations before this committee have laid out a path that I believe will achieve the goals. \n              There are pitfalls. You've already outlined some of them. I've been concerned about staffing. I asked Treasury Board whether they felt that they were appropriately staffed to implement this change, and they said yes.

How would you know? The way the information is presented, it's very difficult for you. You would just have to take it on faith from the Treasury Board Secretariat that it was achieved.

What was mentioned here is the way that different measures are explained in the main estimates and the budget. Sometimes they're completely different—different titles, different explanations—so it's very hard to line them up to see what was the budget measure. In the budget, there is a table with different measures, and you don't see exactly the same items in the main estimates, so it's very hard to connect them.\n               That's what Alex was mentioning.

It's been very instructive and very helpful.\n               If there's one take-away above any others that I can suggest, it's that all committee members should heed your very sage advice that until such time as there is better integration and communication and a true commitment between Treasury Board and Finance, we may be having this discussion again and again over the years. Hopefully, those two entities can come together in an integrated fashion and benefit all parliamentarians with the results.\n              Thank you so much.\n               Colleagues, we are adjourned."}]}
