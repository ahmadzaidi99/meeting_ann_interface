Today's meeting, once again, is dealing with supplementary estimates  and performance reports from various departments.Today we have the pleasure of Minister Brison being with us once again. Welcome, Mr. Brison.I understand you have a short opening statement. We'll start with that, and then we'll follow the normal routine of questioning.Minister, the floor is yours."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "214315", "name": "Hon. Scott Brison (President of the Treasury Board)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm delighted to be here today before your committee to discuss the supplementary estimates. I have with me today from the Treasury Board Secretariat, Yaprak Baltacioglu, secretary of the Treasury Board Secretariat; Brian Pagan, assistant secretary, expenditure management sector; Marcia Santiago, executive director, expenditure management; and Grace Chennette, executive director, financial management directorate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn supplementary estimates  2016-17, the government is seeking Parliament's approval of funding to address matters of importance to Canadians. These include funds for humanitarian assistance, border security, climate change, and veterans and their families. Specifically, the government is seeking parliamentary approval for $2.5 billion in additional investments in 47 organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncluded in this amount are 11 major items valued at more than $50 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are also nine horizontal initiatives in which departments are seeking funding approval to work in partnership on shared outcomes, for instance, in addressing the crisis in Iraq and Syria. Among these requests, I would note $545 million in Treasury Board vote 30 for the Treasury Board Secretariat to fund adjustments to the terms and conditions of employment to plan for the ratification of collective agreements with the Public Service; $350 million for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for the transfer of 19 federal dams to the Government of Saskatchewan, as announced in budget 2016; $178 million for Employment and Social Development Canada to write off unrecoverable Canada student loans; $174 million for Global Affairs Canada for humanitarian assistance and antimicrobial resistance initiatives; $133 million for Global Affairs Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada to help developing countries address the impact of climate change; $132 million for Veterans Affairs Canada for programs and services to support veterans and their families; and a combined total of $118 million to Canada Border Services Agency to maintain the integrity of Canada's border operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese supplementary estimates represent an increase of 2.8% in voted appropriations over the the main estimates tabled in February 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t As you know, the estimates documents also include updated forecasts of statutory authorities authorized by Parliament through separate legislation. Supplementary estimates  include a $964-million net decrease in the statutory forecast, mainly related to reduced interest charges on public debt. There is also a decrease of $431 million in loans to students and apprentices, because this financial assistance is now being offered as grants. This 50% increase in the Canada student grants program was announced in budget 2016, and it will benefit nearly 100,000 students from middle-income families every year. While the government is asking for $2.5 billion to be voted in these estimates, the supplementary estimates  also include an online annex. This annex details close to $3 billion in frozen allotments that will no longer be available to departments for spending. During the fiscal year, the government can adjust the funds available to departments in accordance with evolving program developments and priorities. In this way, the Treasury Board authorizes that funding be frozen so it is not available to spend on anything else. At the end of the fiscal year, these frozen allotments are included in the lapse shown in public accounts. Last year, we introduced this annex to provide greater transparency and accountability. This was actually noted by the PBO. Without this, the first time that frozen allotments would be shown would be in the public accounts, seven or eight months after the end of the fiscal year. Because of our change, parliamentarians and Canadians are now able to see this information much sooner. Another measure we took to make the government more open and transparent and accountable was the new review process to ensure that advertising is non-partisan. Advertising Standards Canada, a national non-for-profit organization committed to ensuring the integrity of advertising, now conducts independent reviews of our ads. As a result, Canadians know that the information they receive from their government represents a legitimate public service announcement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t We have followed through on our budget 2016 commitment to reduce spending on government advertising, travel, and professional services. I'm pleased to say that we have fulfilled our commitment to reduce these expenditures by over $200 million. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Chair, before concluding I'll provide the committee with a brief overview of the requirements of the Treasury Board Secretariat presented in these supplementary estimates .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The department is seeking Parliament's approval to spend an additional $722.7 million. This includes a combined total of $716.8 million in the central votes managed by the secretariat on behalf of the government for Government of Canada obligations that exist across departments and agencies. Specifically these obligations relate to terms and conditions of employment, compensation adjustments with respect to collective bargaining, and even such things as parental leave, as an example of one of these. While these affect individual departments, ultimately Treasury Board is engaged in this.As you know, our commitment to respecting the public service and bargaining in good faith with them has yielded agreements, as of now, with more than 80% of represented public servants. At the time we were elected, all of the collective bargaining agreements had expired, some of them for three or four years almost, and we committed to restoring a culture of respect for and within our public service. Part of that was negotiating in good faith, and we are making significant progress.The majority of the funding related to collective agreements in supplementary estimates  had been set aside by departments during previous years in which the previous government had been unable to reach agreements. It is now being made available as agreements become ratified. In addition to these central funds, we are seeking $5.9 million in TBS vote 1, program expenditures, for items such as improving access to information, funding the back office transformation initiative, advancing the service agenda, and transferring the office of greening government operations to Treasury Board Secretariat, which is something we are very excited about. I want to also commend the parliamentary secretary to Treasury Board, Joyce Murray, who is with us today. She has demonstrated tremendous leadership in establishing our office of greening government in Treasury Board. This is going to make a real difference. We're targeting a reduction by 40% of greenhouse gas emissions for the Government of Canada. This is a significant commitment, but it's going to make a big difference in terms of our leadership as a government with respect to climate change. Last November, when we set the target of reducing emissions by 40% by 2030, we were serious about it, and that's why we're establishing metrics and measuring results, so that Canadians can actually hold us to account. Putting this centre within the Treasury Board Secretariat is really helpful to driving this across departments and agencies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Chair, this concludes my presentation on the main points in supplementary estimates .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Finally, Mr. Chair, I look forward to continuing our discussions on how to improve the estimates process. We've had discussions in good faith among all parties, and we share the view that the current system is confusing, frustrating, illogical, dysfunctional, and opaque. I remain committed, and I look forward to working with you and parliamentarians as we move forward, to improving the system in order to provide better, more timely, more useful information to parliamentarians and better accountability for our government and future governments to Parliament and to Canadians. At this point my officials and I would be pleased to take your questions.Thank you, Mr. Chair."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "219362", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Minister.We'll go into our seven-minute round of questioning.

Could you further explain how this provides greater transparency to parliamentarians? Even on the website itself it is still quite complicated."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "214315", "name": "Hon. Scott Brison", "contribution": "The change has improved transparency from the perspective that previously you had to wait seven or eight months after the fiscal year to have this information. This is recognized by the PBO.It's one step, one initiative, but you're quite right that there's a lot of work left to be done. InfoBase, which is a tool for citizens and for parliamentarians to get more timely information about government activity and expenditures, is helpful. We want to improve it in terms of its user-friendliness, and we want to expand it in terms of what it actually covers.I have to tell you, there are other countries.... I look at Performance.gov, the website that was established under the Obama administration. You can go through departments and agencies, and they are graded and rated on whether or not they are meeting their objectives. There are clear objectives for each department and agency, and citizens and legislators in the U.S. can easily hold departments and agencies to account. That creates an alignment between people on the political side, the citizenry, and the public service to get it done and to ensure that we meet our objectives.Our results policy, which was launched last July, is something that is already making a difference in terms of departments and agencies defining what they do, why they're doing it, and how well they're doing in terms of the results and metrics. We're in the early stages of this, but we want to do a lot more. This committee can be an important partner as we move forward, and I look forward to returning as we strengthen this reportage."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "215934", "name": "Mr. Nick Whalen", "contribution": "A number of my constituents wrote to me about the Jordan's principle funding announced last year. As a result of the lapsed funding page, they were concerned that the $80 million in lapsed funding or frozen allotments under the department that is now Indigenous and Northern Affairs might have been Jordan's principle money. It's not clear from the page.Is there a move afoot to add project-level or program-level descriptions to some of these allotments so Canadians can rest assured that the Jordan's principle money is going to flow forward into next year?"}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "214315", "name": "Hon.

As we move forward, for individual departments and agencies, including Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, this will be one of the areas in which I think you're going to see greater transparency.On this, I know that in terms of Jordan's principle, both Minister Philpott and Minister Bennett are committed to making sure the results are delivered. There has been progress in partnerships with indigenous communities and indigenous leadership. I think over the last year we've worked hard to.... It's not just a matter of dollars and cents in terms of the $8.4 billion committed in budget 2016 to indigenous peoples in Canada. It's really about rebooting a fundamentally important relationship between our government and first nations and indigenous peoples across Canada.

I think that in itself would go some way to the greater transparency Mr. Whalen is looking for.Specifically with respect to the question of the frozen allotments this year, there has been additional detail provided. On page 7 we note the components, or the elements, of the different programs that have been re-profiled or for which the funds are no longer available. With respect to Indian and Northern Affairs, it's footnote 1.8 on page 7. It references transfer payments related to the federal contaminated sites action plan and the settlement and implementation of claims to support consultation and engagement.

Is it going to be greenhouse gas reductions, or is it going to be greenhouse gas reductions per dollar spent on a program-by-program basis?Maybe you could also squeeze in this in the short time allotted.

There was a line under Treasury Board for compensation adjustments. There was a line that talked about pay list requirements. We see that the RCMP itself is requesting $70 million in the supplementary s. We thought maybe this was finally the raise that RCMP members thought was coming.When we looked into it a little more, we saw that it appears that those items under Treasury Board are not pay raise items for the RCMP. It looks like it may not be the case that the money requested by the RCMP under its own departmental plan is for the pay raise for RCMP members. I congratulate the government on the increase in platitudes when it comes to speaking about RCMP members, but as the minister knows, banks don't let RCMP members pay their mortgages in platitudes. It's important not to substitute increases in platitudes for increases in pay.Is there a line in the supplementary estimates  that we've missed wherein there's a raise for RCMP members?

This investment is to fortify the prudential strength of the plan, to render it stable and solid, so it was important to do so.

We have reduced government advertising in terms of our spend on government advertising. A round figure is that it's around a $200-million reduction in advertising and some other areas as well. We've asked the advertising standards council, which is the non-profit organization that helps govern advertising in Canada, to work with us in terms of defining what is partisan and what is not partisan, and we submit our advertising to them to give an opinion. We're seeking to make sure that government advertising is focused on public interest. There is a clear need for legitimate government advertising. Health promotion is one of those areas as well as public safety and security. Our government comms policy is very clear in terms of what is not partisan or partisan.The other thing is that the advertising council will hold us to account, as will Canadians. It is important as we move forward and it's part of a broader commitment we have to greater openness and transparency. We want to apply these principles across government in terms of what we're doing. I think the advertising changes have been well received. They're in their early stages, but I think they've already had some traction and are making a difference in terms of the kind of advertising we as a government are using."}, {"turn": 104, "speakerID": "229555", "name": "Mr. Kyle Peterson", "contribution": "Thank you for that.An important characteristic of the new approach is this external review process, and I think I join with all members in lauding you for your efforts in that.

It's being rolled out through the Treasury Board. I know you didn't get a chance to answer that when he asked the question, so maybe you could take a couple of minutes."}, {"turn": 105, "speakerID": "214315", "name": "Hon. Scott Brison", "contribution": "There has been a lot of work on greening government operations in the U.S. One of the things we learned in our discussions with the U.S. is that the officials there recommended to us that it made sense to house this in a central agency. Treasury Board reaches across every department and agency, whether it's regulatory changes, regulatory policy, or expenditure approval, and as such.... For instance, there are Treasury Board submissions. We can look at Treasury Board submissions through the lens of the greening of government. Everything that comes in we can consider from that perspective.Looking at other governments it made sense for it to be in.... When I was at Public Works, now Public Services and Procurement Canada, in Paul Martin's government, we established an office of greening government operations at that time. It made a difference because Public Works or Public Services and Procurement Canada plays a really important role and will continue to in terms of procurement. Government procurement is very significant, and when governments buy green they help build markets for green products, which ultimately helps commoditize those products and the prices go down so that the broader market of citizens and consumers can benefit from a lot of that. Plus you create green jobs.The Government of Canada has I think about seven million square metres of office space. Half of it I believe is leased; half of it is owned. A lot of those buildings aren't exactly examples of avant garde energy efficiency, but when we green those buildings we do not just cut greenhouse gas emissions, but we cut the heating and cooling costs. There are some really interesting...in other governments in other places, but also including the Government of Canada. The Department of National Defence has done great work on this in Canada, where if you finance the cost of the renovations, you can actually pay for those costs through the delta between the energy costs before and the energy costs after.I'll make just one last point on greening government operations. Do you know that the U.S. government that made in some ways the most significant progress in recent years in terms of greening government operations was that of George W. Bush, in the DOD? The reason they were doing it was on the basis of operational efficacy of defence in terms of strengthening their missions and the ability to do more with less energy requirements.This is a non-partisan issue.

I understand that you have an opening statement. Following that, we'll go directly into questions. The floor is yours."}, {"turn": 185, "speakerID": "223392", "name": "Ms. Marie Lemay (Deputy Minister, Department of Public Works and Government Services)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.Mr. Chair, and honourable committee members, I'm pleased to be here to discuss Public Services and Procurement Canada's departmental performance report for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, and the 2016-17 supplementary estimates . Given the committee's interest, I would also like to take the opportunity to update the members on the progress that we're making on stabilizing the pay system—if that is okay with you—and to address employee pay problems.Sitting beside me are Marty Muldoon, our chief financial officer; Lisa Campbell, who is the assistant deputy minister for marine and defence procurement; and Kevin Radford, the ADM for real property.Public Service and Procurement Canada has a broad mandate to provide key services that support other departments and agencies, parliamentarians, and Canadians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the government's real property manager, purchasing expert, linguistic authority and pay and pension administrator, PSPC supports and facilitates the operations of departments and agencies. This is in keeping with the overarching goal set out in the minister's mandate letter: to ensure that the services provided in her portfolio are delivered efficiently and in a way that makes citizens feel respected and valued.While many think of PSPC in terms of procurement or pay, the department's role in government operations reaches far beyond that.For instance, through the Receiver General function, it manages over $2.2 trillion in cash flow of federal money in and out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.It provides pension services to more than 850,000 members of Canada's military, RCMP and public service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt issues more than 339 million payments per year, including old age security, Canada pension plan, child benefit payments, and EI payments. It manages about $18 billion's worth of procurement on behalf of departments, of which over one-third goes to small and medium businesses. It manages the crown-owned real estate portfolio, with an estimated value of $7 billion. It also produces the Public Accounts of Canada, including the audited financial statement of the Government of Canada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith regard to the Departmental Performance Report in 2015-16, the department made progress in numerous areas. For example, we significantly advanced the modernization of the Parliamentary Precinct. The Wellington Building rehabilitation was completed and work advanced on the West Block, the Government Conference Centre and the new Visitor Welcome Centre. These projects were and continue to be on time, on scope and on budget.The department continued to invest through the Build in Canada Innovation Program, which matches businesses with innovative products and services with the needs of federal departments. Since last April, contracts valued at over $20 million have been awarded to 42 companies. Approximately 80% of companies in the program commercialize their innovations within one year of their contracts ending.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Through the national shipbuilding strategy and the defence procurement strategy investments were made to equip the Canadian Armed Forces and Canadian Coast Guard, while creating jobs and economic benefits for Canada. The department completed the land acquisition for the new St. Lawrence corridor bridge project and entered into a contractual project agreement.The promised review, as you will know, of Canada Post was completed last year. The government is currently preparing its response to the report prepared by this committee, “The Way Forward for Canada Post”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet me take a moment on Phoenix. Since Minister Foote was here last year before this committee on November 29, our priority has been to move toward prompt processing and short waiting times to get us to a steady state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo do this, we executed a three-part plan to increase capacity, efficiency and transparency.Steady state means that 95% of transactions are processed within 20 working days, which is our established service standard for most transactions. We see that there has been progress in moving toward that objective.First, to increase capacity, we have reassigned most of the compensation advisors working on the backlog to the queue. We are prioritizing specific areas to allow us to reach steady state one transaction category at a time.Working with the unions, we identified parental leave and disability leave as the first two priority areas. And we set targets to reach steady state for parental leave by the end of March, and for disability leave by the end of April.We are on track to meet these targets. In fact, new requests for maternity or parental leave will be processed within 20 days of receipt at the Pay Centre, 95% of the time.The vast majority of parental leave transactions in the Pay Centre that are outside of our service standard have been addressed, and employees will start receiving their top-up payments on March 22.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce we have reached a steady state in these two categories, we will shift our focus to other categories. We're starting to process more transactions than we receive. This is a key milestone. It means that both waiting times and overall numbers of the pay requests awaiting processing will start to decrease. The second element of our plan is efficiency. We're implementing technical enhancements to decrease processing times. For example, we recently introduced a new enhancement to automate calculations for past actings. Requests for acting pay that are entered into the system by departments at the start time of the acting period have been automated since the implementation of Phoenix, but now we have automated the past acting, which required very lengthy manual calculations. This new enhancement will decrease the time needed to process these transactions. Right now there are close to 100,000 of those transactions awaiting pay processing at the pay centre, and they represent about 30% of our current workload. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo ensure we effectively manage this large volume of work, they will be processed in a controlled and focused manner between now and June. The plan is for employees to start receiving payments on March 22.The third part of our plan is increased transparency. To ensure that employees have useful information, we are now posting monthly dashboards, which spell out how we are doing against our service standards and the estimated wait times for various transactions.The wait is interminable for employees whose pay has been affected, and we are well aware of that. I would like to be able to tell them that everything will be settled tomorrow, but it is still going to take several months, even though we are making progress.As summer approaches, we are paying special attention to student pay to make sure last year's issues are not repeated. We want to be able to provide timely and accurate pay to students joining the public service when the required documents are sent by their department to the Pay Centre at least 10 days before their start date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLastly, let me touch on tax implications. In February, we issued over 440,000 tax slips for 2016 for the 300,000 employees. We recognize that tax preparation can be confusing, especially given the pay issues. That's why we've equipped our call centre to make sure that we could have additional help to guide employees who have questions. They can contact the call centre, and we can connect them with specialized support or directly with Canada Revenue Agency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs we have said on several occasions, all employees deserve to be paid. I know this is difficult and has sometimes created intolerable situations. We constantly remind employees that they are entitled to an emergency salary advance and to priority payments if they are in a precarious situation. There is no reason for them not to be paid.In conclusion, under the main estimates, $2.9 billion was sought. Under the supplementary estimates , the department is requesting additional funding of $105.6 million, primarily for federal real property management. Taking transfers from other departments into account, the net amount we are seeking is $99.9 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The major items are $27.9 million to continue remediation work at the federal contaminated sites such as the Alaska Highway in northern British Columbia and the former Sambault garbage dump in Quebec, $19.3 million to reduce risks associated with the rehabilitation of the Esquimalt Graving Dock, $18.7 million to account for the fluctuation in expenses related to real property management, and finally, $18.2 million to modernize the heating infrastructure of federal buildings in the national capital.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMr. Chair, we have more than 12,000 employees located in every part of Canada who all share the collective goal of demonstrating integrity, efficiency, and transparency, and care deeply about delivering high quality services to our client departments and Canadians.Thank you for your attention, Mr. Chair and members of the committee.

As a result of that work last November we announced two procurement processes, as the deputy said. Work is starting now on a full competitive process for permanent replacement of the fleet.

That means not just the prime manufacturers but also the entire supply chain. We ask how we can structure this for the benefit of all of the supply chain, making sure that we're maximizing industrial and technological benefits. What is the best way to procure? One of the things that we look at these days in procurement processes is pre-qualification processes to make sure we're talking to serious bidders who actually want to submit a bid, making sure we focus the requirements and make it easy for them to submit bids. We will consult with them, share drafts, and requests for proposal to make sure we get the maximum number of compliant bids in a reasonable time.

How do you assess risk? How do you manage risk? How do people understand that the data integrity, for example, is solid, because you're producing public accounts as well? How do you ensure they flow up, which is a financial risk, an operational risk, and perhaps a human resource risk, and you have these complicated IT systems? When people think it's political, you guys are not political. You have to do your work. In doing your work, how do you ensure that everything is balanced, when you purchase the jets, for example?

That's the high-level risk, but for each project there's a process to do it.We even look at it at the director general level, at the ADM level. Regarding the corporate risk, one of the things we've been talking about and looking at is adding a component in our process to maybe even start with the management executive committee table in setting the frame of the risk, and then bringing it down and bring it back up.On an ongoing basis, we're perfecting our approach to risk. It is very much right now bottom-up and tested as it goes up. We're in the process of adding that layer at the same time with regard to the top-down and bottom-up to make sure we capture all of it because, as you pointed out, we are a huge organization with a lot of money.

We're responsible for the Public Accounts of Canada. Our track record has been zero errors with the public accounts, and that takes a tremendous amount of control over, say, governance and management to ensure that all of the public accounts arrive with that accuracy of data and information. The 2.2 trillion dollars' worth of payments is just one aspect under the Receiver General.In the Receiver General hat, for instance, there would be the entire cascading of control and management that the deputy just spoke to. In every other program, we would have that similar environment.Two or three years ago, we introduced a modified financial management framework. We were basically seeking a greater integration between the management accountabilities and responsibilities for control and administration, and in my hat, the controllership and stewardship responsibilities, a greater integration, so that it wasn't just about compliance.

There is a lot of governance and oversight. There is also robust industry engagement, which helps us. If the client department comes up with requirements and specifications, we validate those with industry. We make sure that the market can offer solutions. We also look for other solutions that might meet the need, and then we come up with a procurement strategy and solicitation process.We are looking, with industry, at how to better share risks. What we don't want to do is to have the government pay for risks that will never materialize, so we are in continuous discussion with industry to make sure that we are balancing risks appropriately. That applies to both fighter procurements and the shipbuilding strategy, where you gain a lot more information once, for example, the ships are under construction. We now have data about what it costs to build blocks of ships in both of the yards.
