Turn 0, A (Grad): Hey , you 're not supposed to be drinking in here dude .
Turn 1, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 2, A (Grad): Do we have to read them that slowly ? OK . Sounded like a robot . Um , this is t
Turn 3, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 4, A (Grad): When you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry .
Turn 5, D (Grad): I tried to go for the EE Cummings sort of feeling , but {disfmarker}
Turn 6, A (Grad): Three three six zero zero . Four two zero zero one seven . That 's what I think of when I think of beat poetry .
Turn 7, C (Grad): Beat poetry .
Turn 8, A (Grad): You ever seen " So I married an axe murderer " ?
Turn 9, C (Grad): Uh parts of it .
Turn 10, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 11, A (Grad): There 's a part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .
Turn 12, C (Grad): Oh yeah ?
Turn 13, A (Grad): And he talks like that . That 's why I thi That uh probably is why I think of it that way .
Turn 14, D (Grad): Hmm . No , I didn't see that movie . Who did {disfmarker} who made that ?
Turn 15, A (Grad): Mike Meyers is the guy .
Turn 16, D (Grad): Oh . OK .
Turn 17, A (Grad): It - it 's his uh {disfmarker} it 's his cute romantic comedy . That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} That 's his cute romantic comedy , yeah . The other thing that 's real funny , I 'll spoil it for you . is when he 's {disfmarker} he works in a coffee shop , in San Francisco , and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso , and he 's like " excuse me I ordered the large espresso ? "
Turn 18, D (Grad): Uh . We 're having , {vocalsound} a tiramisu tasting contest this weekend .
Turn 19, A (Grad): Wait {disfmarker} do are y So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?
Turn 20, D (Grad): No ? Um . There was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,
Turn 21, A (Grad): Ah .
Turn 22, D (Grad): and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste {disfmarker} do a blind taste {vocalsound} and then vote .
Turn 23, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 24, D (Grad): Should be fun .
Turn 25, A (Grad): Seems like {disfmarker} Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours . Then , if you were to bribe them , you could uh {disfmarker}
Turn 26, D (Grad): Mm - hmm . Well , I was thinking if um {disfmarker} y you guys have plans for Sunday ? We 're {disfmarker} we 're not {disfmarker} it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but um we 're sort of working with the weather here because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what {disfmarker} whoever brings whatever you know , can throw it on there . So only the tiramisu is free , nothing else .
Turn 27, A (Grad): Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend , so , I 'll be out of town .
Turn 28, D (Grad): So you 're going to the west Bay then ? No ,
Turn 29, A (Grad): No , the South Bay ,
Turn 30, D (Grad): south Bay ?
Turn 31, A (Grad): yeah .
Turn 32, D (Grad): South Bay .
Turn 33, C (Grad): Well , I should be free , so .
Turn 34, D (Grad): OK , I 'll let you know .
Turn 35, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 36, A (Grad): We are . Is Nancy s uh gonna show up ? Mmm . Wonder if these things ever emit a very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ?
Turn 37, D (Grad): They are gonna get more comfortable headsets . They already ordered them . OK .
Turn 38, C (Grad): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 39, D (Grad): Let 's get started . The uh {disfmarker} Should I go first , with the uh , um , data . Can I have the remote {vocalsound} control . Thank you . OK . So . On Friday we had our wizard test data test and um {vocalsound} these are some of the results . This was the introduction . I actually uh , even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject , I sort of felt that she knew too much , so I asked uh Litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject .
Turn 40, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 41, D (Grad): So , this is what she saw as part of {disfmarker} as uh for instr introduction , this is what she had to read {pause} aloud . Uh , that was really difficult for her and uh {disfmarker}
Turn 42, C (Grad): Because of l all the names , you mean ?
Turn 43, D (Grad): The names and um this was the uh first three tasks she had to {disfmarker} to master after she called the system , and um then of course the system broke down , and those were the l uh uh I should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human {disfmarker} Um . There are {disfmarker} here are uh the results . Mmm . And I will not {disfmarker} We will skip the reading now . D Um . And um . The reading was five minutes , exactly . And now comes the {disfmarker} This is the phone - in phase of {disfmarker}
Turn 44, C (Grad): Wait , can I {disfmarker} I have a question . So . So there 's no system , right ? Like , there was a wizard for both uh {disfmarker} both parts , is this right ?
Turn 45, D (Grad): Yeah . It was bo it both times the same person .
Turn 46, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 47, D (Grad): One time , pretending to be a system , one time , to {disfmarker} pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending .
Turn 48, C (Grad): OK . And she didn't {disfmarker}
Turn 49, D (Grad): I should {disfmarker}
Turn 50, C (Grad): I mean . Well . Isn't this kind of obvious when it says " OK now you 're talking to a human " and then the human has the same voice ?
Turn 51, D (Grad): No no no . We u Wait . OK , good question , but uh you {disfmarker} you just wait and see .
Turn 52, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 53, D (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} You 're gonna l learn . And um the wizard sometimes will not be audible , Because she was actually {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} there was some uh lapse in the um wireless , we have to move her closer .
Turn 54, A (Grad): Is she mispronouncing " Anlage " ? Is it " Anlaga " or " Anlunga "
Turn 55, D (Grad): They 're mispronouncing everything ,
Turn 56, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 57, D (Grad): but it 's {disfmarker} This is the system breaking down , actually . " Did I call Europe ? " So , this is it . Well , if we {disfmarker} we um
Turn 58, B (Professor): So , are {disfmarker} are you trying to record this meeting ?
Turn 59, D (Grad): There was a strange reflex . I have a headache . I 'm really sort of out of it . OK , the uh lessons learned . The reading needs to be shorter . Five minutes is just too long . Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} subjects are probably not gonna {disfmarker} going to follow the order . And uh she did not .
Turn 60, C (Grad): Really ?
Turn 61, D (Grad): She {disfmarker} No .
Turn 62, C (Grad): Oh , it 's surprising .
Turn 63, D (Grad): She {disfmarker} she jumped around quite a bit .
Turn 64, B (Professor): S so if you just number them " one " , " two " , " three " it 's
Turn 65, D (Grad): Yeah , and make it sort of clear in the uh {disfmarker}
Turn 66, B (Professor): OK . Right .
Turn 67, D (Grad): Um . We need to {disfmarker} So that 's one thing . And we need a better introduction for the wizard . That is something that Fey actually thought of a {disfmarker} in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called .
Turn 68, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . True .
Turn 69, D (Grad): And um , um , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks . So when {disfmarker} when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth .
Turn 70, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 71, D (Grad): So we get nice um data for that . Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , so where , even though w we don't tell the person " ask {pause} blah - blah - blah - blah - blah " they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible .
Turn 72, C (Grad): Say exactly what 's on there ? Yeah .
Turn 73, D (Grad): And uh my suggestion is of course we {disfmarker} we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job ,
Turn 74, B (Professor): Great .
Turn 75, D (Grad): in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for , " How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer " so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure .
Turn 76, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 77, D (Grad): Um . Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard .
Turn 78, A (Grad): Yes .
Turn 79, D (Grad): So um .
Turn 80, A (Grad): I wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for {pause} uh " not a man " .
Turn 81, C (Grad): There 's no female equivalent of {disfmarker}
Turn 82, D (Grad): But uh {disfmarker}
Turn 83, A (Grad): Are you sure ?
Turn 84, C (Grad): No , I don't know .
Turn 85, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 86, C (Grad): Not that I know of .
Turn 87, D (Grad): Well , there is witch and warlock ,
Turn 88, A (Grad): Yeah , that 's so @ @ .
Turn 89, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 90, C (Grad): Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but {disfmarker}
Turn 91, D (Grad): and uh {disfmarker}
Turn 92, B (Professor): Right . Uh .
Turn 93, D (Grad): OK . And um {disfmarker} So , some {disfmarker} some work needs to be done , but I think we can uh {disfmarker} And this , and {disfmarker} in case no {disfmarker} you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh {disfmarker} um while taking the {disfmarker} while partaking in the data collection .
Turn 94, C (Grad): Ah .
Turn 95, B (Professor): OK , great . So {pause} first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her . Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well . Um , do you know exactly how to do that , or is uh Lila {disfmarker} I mean , you know what exactly do we do to {disfmarker} to put her on the payroll in some way ?
Turn 96, D (Grad): I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn .
Turn 97, B (Professor): OK . Well , you 'll have to . Right . So anyway , um
Turn 98, D (Grad): N
Turn 99, B (Professor): So why don't you uh ask Lila and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in th
Turn 100, D (Grad): Student - type worker ,
Turn 101, B (Professor): Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a {disfmarker} a student ,
Turn 102, D (Grad): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 103, B (Professor): she just graduated but anyway .
Turn 104, D (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 105, B (Professor): So i if {disfmarker} Yeah , I agree , she sounded fine , she a actually was {pause} uh , more uh , present and stuff than {disfmarker} than she was in conversation , so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her .
Turn 106, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 107, B (Professor): So I think that 's great .
Turn 108, D (Grad): This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison ,
Turn 109, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 110, D (Grad): and I didn't even spell it out here and in some cases I {disfmarker} I spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly ,
Turn 111, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 112, D (Grad): this is the information on {disfmarker} on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up , and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better .
Turn 113, B (Professor): Oh , yeah , and then of course as she does it she 'll {disfmarker} she 'll learn @ @ .  So that 's great . Um {pause} And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .
Turn 114, D (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 115, B (Professor): And , uh she 's {disfmarker} actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know uh , to do her career .
Turn 116, D (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 117, B (Professor): So , I {disfmarker} my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job . And , so {disfmarker}
Turn 118, D (Grad): Yep . Yeah she {disfmarker} she didn't explicitly state that so .
Turn 119, B (Professor): Great .
Turn 120, D (Grad): And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people . She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so .
Turn 121, B (Professor): Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to
Turn 122, D (Grad): We 're already {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 123, B (Professor): uh {disfmarker}
Turn 124, D (Grad): However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there . And um , we 'll see .
Turn 125, B (Professor): Yeah . We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something ,
Turn 126, D (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 127, B (Professor): but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . And {disfmarker} and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .
Turn 128, D (Grad): Mmm . Yep .
Turn 129, B (Professor): Uh , so that 's good . Um . Now , {pause} I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this .
Turn 130, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 131, B (Professor): So , my idea on that was {pause} uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all {disfmarker} um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , because to the extent that we can get them contributing , that will be good . So this issue about you know re - formulating things ,
Turn 132, D (Grad): Yep .
Turn 133, B (Professor): maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , but in any case ,
Turn 134, D (Grad): Yep .
Turn 135, B (Professor): um , the linguistics students and stuff . So my idea on {disfmarker} on Wednesday is partly to uh {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean , what you did today would {disfmarker} i is just fine . You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the {pause} thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and {disfmarker} and so forth . " But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of {disfmarker} of what 's going on with the system design , and where we think the belief - nets fit in and where the pieces are and stuff like that . Is {disfmarker} is this {pause} make sense to everybody ?
Turn 136, D (Grad): Yep .
Turn 137, B (Professor): Yeah . So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to make a big presentation . I don't think you should {disfmarker} you don't have to make any new {pause} uh PowerPoint or anything . I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about . And , then um just see how a discussion goes .
Turn 138, D (Grad): Mm - hmm . Sounds good . The uh other two things is um we 've {disfmarker} can have Johno tell us a little about this
Turn 139, B (Professor): Great .
Turn 140, D (Grad): and we also have a l little bit on the interface , M - three - L enhancement , and then um that was it , I think .
Turn 141, A (Grad): So , what I did for this {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} uh , a pedagogical belief - net because I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I took {disfmarker} I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out {disfmarker} so what I did was I took {disfmarker} I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .
Turn 142, B (Professor): Yep .
Turn 143, A (Grad): And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .
Turn 144, B (Professor): Yep .
Turn 145, A (Grad): And I separated them out . And then I um did similar things for our {disfmarker} our net to {disfmarker} uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot , um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the {disfmarker} the top layer .
Turn 146, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 147, A (Grad): And then the bottom layer is just the Mode . So .
Turn 148, B (Professor): So , let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't understand it . Let 's go {disfmarker} Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like , or is that it ?
Turn 149, A (Grad): Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says " Mode " which is the decision between the {disfmarker}
Turn 150, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 151, B (Professor): OK , great . Alright .
Turn 152, A (Grad): So basically all I did was I took the last {pause} belief - net
Turn 153, B (Professor): So {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .
Turn 154, A (Grad): and I grouped things according to what {disfmarker} how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .
Turn 155, B (Professor): Yep . Mm - hmm .
Turn 156, A (Grad): And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .
Turn 157, B (Professor): Right , yep .
Turn 158, A (Grad): Um , you know , we have {disfmarker} we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,
Turn 159, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 160, A (Grad): or they were hurried . That 's kind of related to that . And then um in terms of the source , the things {disfmarker} uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether {disfmarker} Oh actually , I kind of , {disfmarker} I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but uh whether the {disfmarker} where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether {disfmarker}
Turn 161, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 162, A (Grad): or the " landmark - iness " of where I 'm currently at . And " usefulness " is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not {disfmarker} something that you 'd visit for tourist 's {disfmarker} tourism 's sake or whatever . " Travel constraints " would be something like you know , maybe they said they can {disfmarker} they only wanna take a bus or something like that , right ? And then those are somewhat related to the path ,
Turn 163, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 164, A (Grad): so that would determine whether we 'd {disfmarker} could take {disfmarker} we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . Um , " Goal " . Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination . Um , and then if you go up , Robert , Yeah , so {disfmarker} um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person . Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .
Turn 165, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 166, A (Grad): Uh , Prosody I don't really {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context , so I just made up you know whether {disfmarker} whether what they say is {disfmarker} or h how they say it is {disfmarker} is that .
Turn 167, B (Professor): Right , OK .
Turn 168, A (Grad): Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose , and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever .
Turn 169, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 170, A (Grad): And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .
Turn 171, D (Grad): What 's " tourbook " ?
Turn 172, A (Grad): Tourbook ? That would be , I don't know , the " landmark - iness " of things ,
Turn 173, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 174, A (Grad): whether it 's in the tourbook or not .
Turn 175, B (Professor): Ch - ch - ch - ch . Now . Alright , so I understand what 's {disfmarker} what you got . I don't yet understand {pause} how you would use it . So let me see if I can ask
Turn 176, A (Grad): Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .
Turn 177, B (Professor): a s Right . No , I understand that , but {disfmarker} but um So , what {disfmarker} Let 's slide back up again and see {disfmarker} start at the {disfmarker} at the bottom and Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . Yeah . So , you could imagine w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something .
Turn 178, A (Grad): Well I {disfmarker} OK , I just {disfmarker} Say what you were gonna say .
Turn 179, B (Professor): Good , do it !
Turn 180, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 181, B (Professor): No no , go do it .
Turn 182, A (Grad): Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} No , I was gonna wait until {disfmarker}
Turn 183, B (Professor): Oh , OK . So , so if you {disfmarker} if we made {disfmarker} if we wanted to make it into a {disfmarker} a real uh Bayes - net , that is , you know , with fill {disfmarker} you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh {disfmarker}
Turn 184, A (Grad): So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode .
Turn 185, B (Professor): Well , I don't {disfmarker} That 's an issue . So , um {disfmarker}
Turn 186, A (Grad): Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .
Turn 187, B (Professor): Well , here 's the problem . And {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today {disfmarker} is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing . And uh {disfmarker}
Turn 188, A (Grad): Well I {disfmarker} oh yeah , I unders I understand that , I just {disfmarker} uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .
Turn 189, B (Professor): Well , i But that 's what we have to do .
Turn 190, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 191, B (Professor): OK , so , so , uh . There {disfmarker} there are a variety of ways of doing it . Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and {disfmarker} about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness .
Turn 192, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 193, B (Professor): Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply .
Turn 194, A (Grad): So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 195, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . And , um So .
Turn 196, A (Grad): So in that case , the sum we 'd have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . We 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were {disfmarker} I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other {disfmarker}
Turn 197, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 198, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 199, B (Professor): So what I was gonna say is {disfmarker} is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally {disfmarker} I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things .
Turn 200, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 201, B (Professor): And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n {pause} each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics . So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , OK ? then you could say " Aha , let 's have these three factors " , OK ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .
Turn 202, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 203, B (Professor): And then the question would be if {disfmarker} if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing
Turn 204, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 205, B (Professor): given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that . Um and
Turn 206, A (Grad): So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?
Turn 207, B (Professor): " Eh - eh - eh . " Yeah .
Turn 208, A (Grad): So that {disfmarker}
Turn 209, B (Professor): Well , mmm , something . I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .
Turn 210, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 211, B (Professor): and , um , I understand where this {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and {disfmarker} and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .
Turn 212, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 213, B (Professor): Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to {disfmarker} Well , maybe they will . Well , let me think about whether {disfmarker} whether I think we can present this to them or not . Um , Uh ,
Turn 214, D (Grad): Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc . This is sort of th the second {vocalsound} version and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} look at this maybe just as a , you know , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John {disfmarker} Johno said .
Turn 215, A (Grad): We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .
Turn 216, D (Grad): Yeah . But the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the nice thing is that you know , it just is a {disfmarker} is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully
Turn 217, B (Professor): Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,
Turn 218, D (Grad): and uh
Turn 219, B (Professor): and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that {disfmarker} that is helpful to them .
Turn 220, D (Grad): I mean , ultimately we {disfmarker} we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in {disfmarker} in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask , that you can give input and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you , uh throw the die for you , because um I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in {disfmarker} in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh {disfmarker} this thing . Close this down . So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us , um {disfmarker} And a very simple thing . We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .
Turn 221, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 222, D (Grad): And this {disfmarker} these uh {disfmarker} this changed now only um , um {disfmarker} It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once . Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways .
Turn 223, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . Good .
Turn 224, D (Grad): Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " . So this is just based on this one {disfmarker} um , on this one feature , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's about all you can do . And so in the f if this pla if the object type um here is {disfmarker} is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be um " Vista " . And um this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify " OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case " , and so forth , it just gets really really messy .
Turn 225, B (Professor): OK , I 'm sorry . You 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker}
Turn 226, D (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 227, B (Professor): It was much too quick for me . OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying . So , I {disfmarker} I do understand that uh you can take the M - three - L and add not {disfmarker} and it w and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say " If it 's of type " Landmark " , then you take {disfmarker} you 're gonna take a picture of it . "
Turn 228, D (Grad): Exactly .
Turn 229, B (Professor): F full stop , I mean , that 's what you do . Ev - every landmark you take a picture of ,
Turn 230, D (Grad): Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .
Turn 231, B (Professor): you enter {disfmarker} You approach . OK . Uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing SmartKom system . And you just did , right ? OK .
Turn 232, D (Grad): Yeah . And it {disfmarker} it would do us no good .
Turn 233, B (Professor): Ah .
Turn 234, D (Grad): That {disfmarker} Ultimately .
Turn 235, B (Professor): Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this .
Turn 236, D (Grad): W
Turn 237, B (Professor): Um , that 's a {disfmarker} that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing " OK , here 's a {disfmarker} another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this " . Add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , " pppt ! " You do that . Um , then the question would be Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , OK ? because that 's all {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} all you 're using is this type {disfmarker} the types in the ontology and you 're done .
Turn 238, D (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 239, B (Professor): Right ? So we don't {disfmarker} we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things .
Turn 240, D (Grad): No .
Turn 241, B (Professor): Alright , but that 's {disfmarker} but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things . And that 's something the uh SmartKom people themselves would {disfmarker} they 'd say " Sure , that 's no problem {disfmarker} you know , no problem to add types to the ont " Right ?
Turn 242, D (Grad): Yeah . No . And this is {disfmarker} just in order to exemplify what {disfmarker} what we can do very , very easily is , um we have this {disfmarker} this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .
Turn 243, B (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 244, D (Grad): Now , the content {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} whi which is sort of what {disfmarker} what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever .
Turn 245, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 246, D (Grad): This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some {disfmarker} some form , and have this be in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in the content , loosely called " Constructicon " . And the rules we want to throw away completely . And um {disfmarker} and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . This decides whether it 's an whether action {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Enter , the Vista , or the whatever
Turn 247, B (Professor): Uh , " approach " , you called it , I think this time .
Turn 248, D (Grad): uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .
Turn 249, B (Professor): That 's what you said {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's fine . Yeah , but {disfmarker} Right . But it 's not construction there , it 's action . Construction is a d is a different story .
Turn 250, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 251, A (Grad): Right . This is uh {disfmarker} so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the {disfmarker} for the X - schema ?
Turn 252, B (Professor): For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} Yes .
Turn 253, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 254, B (Professor): Yeah . So that {disfmarker} that uh i if you had the generalized " Go " X - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .
Turn 255, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 256, B (Professor): And then uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the GIS and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning . So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that .
Turn 257, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 258, B (Professor): But that 's not {disfmarker} It 's not the immediate problem .
Turn 259, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 260, B (Professor): But , presumably that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that functionality 's there when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker}
Turn 261, A (Grad): So the immediate problem is just deciding w which {disfmarker}
Turn 262, D (Grad): Aspects of the X - schema to add .
Turn 263, B (Professor): Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is {disfmarker} is back t t to what you were {disfmarker} what you are doing with the belief - net .
Turn 264, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 265, B (Professor): You know , uh what are we going to use to make this decision {disfmarker}
Turn 266, A (Grad): Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?
Turn 267, B (Professor): Yeah . Right . Right . Well , that {disfmarker} that actually is relatively easy in this case .
Turn 268, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 269, B (Professor): The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ? And that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the hardest problem . So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the {disfmarker} what the person says and the context and the ontology . The h So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is {disfmarker} is
Turn 270, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 271, B (Professor): where are you gonna {disfmarker} how are you gonna g get this information . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} so , getting back to here , uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we {disfmarker} we don't want all the com
Turn 272, A (Grad): There 's just too many factors right now .
Turn 273, B (Professor): too many factors if we {disfmarker} if we allow them to just go combinatorially .
Turn 274, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 275, B (Professor): So we wanna think about which ones we really care about and what they really most depend on , and can we c you know , clean this {disfmarker} this up to the point where it {disfmarker}
Turn 276, A (Grad): So what we really wanna do i cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it {disfmarker} expand it out into more layers basically ?
Turn 277, B (Professor): Right . We might . Uh , I mean that {disfmarker} that 's certainly one thing we can do . Uh , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have {disfmarker} what you 're having is the values rather than the variable . So uh {disfmarker}
Turn 278, A (Grad): Right . So instead of in instead it should really be {disfmarker} just be " intention " as a node instead of " intention business " or " intention tour " .
Turn 279, B (Professor): OK ? So you {disfmarker} Yeah , right , and then it would have values , uh , " Tour " , " Business " , or uh " Hurried " .
Turn 280, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 281, B (Professor): But then {disfmarker} but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .
Turn 282, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 283, B (Professor): I mean , it 's fine . You know , we have to {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's iterative . We 're gonna have to work with it some .
Turn 284, A (Grad): I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention and the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time {disfmarker}
Turn 285, B (Professor): Well , you {disfmarker} you could do that . And it 's perfectly OK {pause} to uh insist that {disfmarker} that , you know , th um , they add up to one , but that there 's uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .
Turn 286, A (Grad): Mmm . OK .
Turn 287, B (Professor): OK . So you could have the conditional p So the {disfmarker} each of these things is gonna be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a probability . So whenever there 's a choice , uh {disfmarker} so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,
Turn 288, A (Grad): Well , see I don't think those would be mutually {disfmarker}
Turn 289, B (Professor): OK {disfmarker}
Turn 290, A (Grad): it seems like something could both be {disfmarker}
Turn 291, B (Professor): Absolutely right .
Turn 292, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 293, B (Professor): And so that you might want to then have those b Th - Then they may have to be separate . They may not be able to be values of the same variable .
Turn 294, D (Grad): Object type , mm - hmm .
Turn 295, B (Professor): So that 's {disfmarker} but again , this is {disfmarker} this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through . Right . It 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's great {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is , you know , as one step toward uh {disfmarker} toward where we wanna go .
Turn 296, D (Grad): Also it strikes me that we {disfmarker} we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a {disfmarker} uh , a specification for some interface , here that um takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it . Then we discussed in our pre - edu {disfmarker} EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one , and so um we {disfmarker} we may wanna decide we can do this from here , but we also could do it um you know if we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a belief - net interface . So the belief - net takes as input , a vector , right ? of stuff . And it {disfmarker} Yeah . And um it Output is whatever , as well . But this information is just M - three - L , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff in the {disfmarker} maybe we want to ask the real world , maybe you want to look something up in the GRS , but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . Based on we {disfmarker} we have uh {disfmarker} I was just made some examples from the ontology and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a building and it has doors and stuff like this , but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , " were any of these things that {disfmarker} that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? " ,
Turn 297, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 298, D (Grad): " were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? " ,
Turn 299, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 300, D (Grad): and so forth , and maybe draw some inferences on that . So this may be a {disfmarker} a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net ,
Turn 301, B (Professor): Yeah . I think that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's exactly right .
Turn 302, D (Grad): and then {disfmarker}
Turn 303, B (Professor): There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . Yeah ,
Turn 304, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 305, B (Professor): no I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's just fine . Uh , yeah . So they 'll {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that " Agent " , yeah , " Agent " , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah , that uh is rule - driven , and can {disfmarker} can uh {disfmarker} can do things like that . And um there 's an issue about whether there will be {disfmarker} that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision , so it probably will . My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a {disfmarker} a c this belief - net that {disfmarker} turn a crank in the belief - net , that 'll come out with s uh more {disfmarker} another vector , OK , which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end . So you now know what you 're gonna do and that may actually involve getting more information . So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says " Ah ! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . " OK ? Now that we know that it 's a bus trip , OK ? we didn't {disfmarker} We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but {disfmarker} but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more .
Turn 306, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 307, B (Professor): So I think that 's OK .
Turn 308, D (Grad): Mm - hmm . So this is actually , s if {disfmarker} if we were to build something that is um , and , uh , I had one more thing , the {disfmarker} it needs to do {disfmarker} Yeah . I think we {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can come up with a {disfmarker} a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing ,
Turn 309, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 310, D (Grad): but it looks of complect object trees and decides how {disfmarker} are there parts missing that need to be filled out , there 's {disfmarker} this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together . So maybe this is actually some {disfmarker} some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part ,
Turn 311, B (Professor): Oh , OK . Uh .
Turn 312, D (Grad): then . Yeah .
Turn 313, B (Professor): I confess , I 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story . Um . I i This {disfmarker} this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work . So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more . Um . In particular {disfmarker} see what we 'd like to do , and {disfmarker} and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use . So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source {disfmarker} source , paths and goals , and nnn {comment} all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . And that {disfmarker} uh there 's {disfmarker} there 's some {disfmarker} some important generalities that you 're getting , so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it . And I don't yet see how that goes . Alright .
Turn 314, D (Grad): There 're no primitives upon which {pause} uh
Turn 315, B (Professor): u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this {disfmarker}
Turn 316, D (Grad): yeah .
Turn 317, B (Professor): So I y I 'm just {disfmarker} just there saying eee {comment} well you {disfmarker} I know how to do any individual case , right ? but I don't yet {disfmarker} see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to {pause} get powerful generalizations . And
Turn 318, D (Grad): Yep .
Turn 319, B (Professor): um
Turn 320, D (Grad): Maybe we sho should we a add then the " what 's this ? " domain ? N I mean , we have to " how do I get to X " . Then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different {disfmarker}
Turn 321, B (Professor): Could . Uh .
Turn 322, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 323, D (Grad): Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore .
Turn 324, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 325, D (Grad): So he {disfmarker} he dislikes the term .
Turn 326, B (Professor): Well , I {disfmarker} I don't like the term either , so I have n i uh i i y w i i It uh {disfmarker}
Turn 327, D (Grad): But um , I 'm sure the " what 's this ? " questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects .
Turn 328, B (Professor): Could be . I 'm not a {disfmarker} I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,
Turn 329, D (Grad): So .
Turn 330, B (Professor): I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them .
Turn 331, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 332, B (Professor): Uh ,
Turn 333, C (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 334, B (Professor): I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this . I just at the moment don't know .
Turn 335, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 336, B (Professor): H No . Well , no the Bayes {disfmarker} the Bayes - nets {disfmarker} The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the {disfmarker} uh general . So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , you shouldn't have to do that differently for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , for uh telling someone else how to go there ,
Turn 337, D (Grad): Getting out of {disfmarker}
Turn 338, B (Professor): whatever it is . So that {disfmarker} that , the {disfmarker} the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . So all sorts of different tasks {pause} and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . And that 's {disfmarker} that would be the really pretty result . And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , i that {disfmarker} that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent {disfmarker} you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it {disfmarker} about {disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way . So that 's the {disfmarker} You might . You might . You might be able to {disfmarker} to uh say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} Let 's say there 's a uh cont there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . OK . So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . And that may effect the way you process everything else . So if you say " how do I get into the castle " OK , then um {disfmarker} Or , you know , " what is there in the castle " or {disfmarker} so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is .
Turn 339, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 340, B (Professor): Alright , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the thesis level
Turn 341, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 342, B (Professor): uh {disfmarker}
Turn 343, D (Grad): It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs because they 're really fancy then , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for these kinds of analysis . But uh .
Turn 344, B (Professor): Well , you have prepositional phrases that {disfmarker}
Turn 345, D (Grad): Yeah , but they 're {disfmarker} they 're easier for parsers .
Turn 346, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 347, D (Grad): Parsers can pick those up but {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker} with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . Because the {disfmarker} mean the semantics are very complex in that .
Turn 348, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 349, D (Grad): OK , yeah ? I had one more {pause} thing . I don't remember . I just forgot it again . No . Oh yeah , b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to {disfmarker} to throw this away and {disfmarker} and replace it with something else , or whatever , so that we have {disfmarker} so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately . Should be decoupled , yeah . OK .
Turn 350, B (Professor): Right . So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ? I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm happy to do that . We {disfmarker} we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine .
Turn 351, D (Grad): Yeah , um , Liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time . I don't think we will need to do that but it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 352, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 353, D (Grad): so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 354, B (Professor): Oh yeah . No I {disfmarker} I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at .
Turn 355, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 356, B (Professor): I mean . Why not .
Turn 357, D (Grad): And um . Yeah , that was my {disfmarker}
Turn 358, B (Professor): She was good . Litonya was good .
Turn 359, D (Grad): Yeah ? The uh {disfmarker} um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she {disfmarker} she showed us some of the weaknesses
Turn 360, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 361, D (Grad): and um also the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the fact that she was a real subject you know , is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Turn 362, B (Professor): Right . Yeah , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} yeah and {disfmarker} and she took it seriously and stuff l No , it was great .
Turn 363, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 364, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 365, D (Grad): So I think that um {disfmarker} I mean , w Looking {disfmarker} just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem , for example , is , you know , she actually m said {disfmarker} you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff . Nuh ? So this is definitely interesting , and {disfmarker}
Turn 366, C (Grad): Yeah , right .
Turn 367, D (Grad): Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti , also , of course , not in the sentence " How do you get there ? " was pretty standard . Nuh ? except that there was a nice anaphora , you know , for pointing at what she talked about before , and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls , so
Turn 368, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 369, D (Grad): Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge . This would have been a classical um uh " Tango " , actually . Um , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside ,
Turn 370, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 371, D (Grad): but OK . So the mistake {comment} would have make a mistake {disfmarker} the system would have made a mistake here .
Turn 372, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 373, B (Professor): Click ? Alright .
