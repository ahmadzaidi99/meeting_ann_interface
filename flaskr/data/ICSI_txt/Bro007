Turn 0, B (Professor): OK So uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual but um got tables in front of us . Um what is {disfmarker} what does combo mean ?
Turn 1, C (PhD): So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh {disfmarker} another MLP and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . Um the output is used as uh features as well .
Turn 2, B (Professor): Um so let me try to restate this and see if I have it right . There is uh {disfmarker} there is the features uh there 's the OGI features and then um those features um go through a contextual {disfmarker} uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . Um those features go through a contextualized KLT . Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered
Turn 3, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah so yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard
Turn 4, B (Professor): Sure . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 5, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 6, D (PhD): The graph , yeah another one .
Turn 7, B (Professor): Yeah , that 's good .
Turn 8, C (PhD): 
Turn 9, B (Professor): So
Turn 10, C (PhD): So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths .
Turn 11, B (Professor): Yeah . Three , OK .
Turn 12, C (PhD): The first is a KLT using several frames of the features .
Turn 13, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 14, C (PhD): The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames {disfmarker} several frames of features
Turn 15, B (Professor): Yeah . Uh - huh .
Turn 16, C (PhD): The third path is this low - pass filter .
Turn 17, B (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 18, C (PhD): Uh , MLP
Turn 19, B (Professor): Aha ! aha !
Turn 20, C (PhD): Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the {disfmarker} the proposal from {disfmarker} for the first evaluation .
Turn 21, B (Professor): Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 22, C (PhD): And then the KLT and then the two together again .
Turn 23, B (Professor): No , the KLT . And those two together . That 's it .
Turn 24, D (PhD): Two HTK .
Turn 25, B (Professor): OK so that 's {disfmarker} that 's this bottom one .
Turn 26, C (PhD): Um . So this is {disfmarker} yeah
Turn 27, B (Professor): And so uh and then the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the one at the top {disfmarker} and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?
Turn 28, C (PhD): Yeah that 's the reason , yeah .
Turn 29, B (Professor): Oh let 's focus on them then so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?
Turn 30, C (PhD): For the f the f first yellow line you mean ?
Turn 31, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 32, C (PhD): Yeah so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .
Turn 33, D (PhD): Step .
Turn 34, C (PhD): Well . There 's {disfmarker} there 's no low {disfmarker} low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .
Turn 35, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 36, C (PhD): Um
Turn 37, B (Professor): Do you e um they mentioned {disfmarker} made some {disfmarker} uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they {disfmarker} they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .
Turn 38, C (PhD): Yeah . Uh actually the way things seems to um well it 's uh forty percent for TI - digit , sixty for all the SpeechDat - Cars , well all these languages . Ehm the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . Yeah .
Turn 39, B (Professor): Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ?
Turn 40, C (PhD): Uh , no .
Turn 41, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 42, C (PhD): But yeah . Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close whatever the {disfmarker} the system .
Turn 43, B (Professor): OK . And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?
Turn 44, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 45, B (Professor): I mean not {disfmarker}
Turn 46, C (PhD): Uh not yet .
Turn 47, B (Professor): OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good {disfmarker}
Turn 48, C (PhD): No . Mmm yeah , yeah .
Turn 49, B (Professor): then we could compare the two and say what was better .
Turn 50, C (PhD): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 51, B (Professor): Um and how does this compare to the numbers {disfmarker} oh so OGI two is just the top {disfmarker} top row ?
Turn 52, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 53, C (PhD): So yeah to {disfmarker} actually OGI two is the {disfmarker} the baseline with the OGI features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've {disfmarker} they 're still made some changes in the features
Turn 54, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 55, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} well but uh actually our results are better than their results . Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results
Turn 56, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 57, C (PhD): Uh
Turn 58, B (Professor): Uh OK so the one {disfmarker} one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .
Turn 59, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 60, B (Professor): An
Turn 61, C (PhD): Yeah there is something funny happening here because {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 62, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 63, C (PhD): But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are {disfmarker} we are {disfmarker} we are around forty - two and
Turn 64, B (Professor): Now up
Turn 65, C (PhD): but
Turn 66, B (Professor): Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a {disfmarker} a second um silence detection .
Turn 67, C (PhD): Yeah . So there are some results here
Turn 68, D (PhD): For the Italian .
Turn 69, C (PhD): uh so the third and the fifth line of the table
Turn 70, D (PhD): For this one .
Turn 71, B (Professor): So filt is what that is ?
Turn 72, C (PhD): Filt , yeah
Turn 73, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 74, C (PhD): Um yeah so it seems f for the {disfmarker} the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . Uh but uh actually apparently there are {disfmarker} there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . Uh well
Turn 75, B (Professor): Oh we can't do it . Oh OK .
Turn 76, C (PhD): No .
Turn 77, D (PhD): For that {disfmarker} for that we {disfmarker}
Turn 78, B (Professor): Oh .
Turn 79, C (PhD): Uh
Turn 80, B (Professor): Too bad . Good idea , but can't do it .
Turn 81, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 82, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 83, C (PhD): Except I don't know because they {disfmarker} I think they are still working well .
Turn 84, B (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 85, C (PhD): Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and {disfmarker} but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the {disfmarker} the feature computation and so we don't
Turn 86, B (Professor): OK . So Alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum doesn't have a huge effect but it {disfmarker} but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .
Turn 87, C (PhD): I th
Turn 88, B (Professor): Uh little bit .
Turn 89, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 90, B (Professor): Um and um um Yeah and uh let 's see What else did we have in there ? Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is I {disfmarker} I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you {disfmarker} you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that {disfmarker} that one you can't use because of the delay . Those look pretty good . Um let 's see that one Well even the {disfmarker} just the {disfmarker} the second row doesn't look that bad right ? That 's just uh yeah ?
Turn 91, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 92, B (Professor): And {disfmarker} and that looks like an interesting one too .
Turn 93, D (PhD): Mmm yeah .
Turn 94, B (Professor): Uh
Turn 95, C (PhD): Actually the {disfmarker} yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we don't have this KLT on the first {disfmarker} on the left part of the diagram . We just have the features as they are .
Turn 96, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 97, C (PhD): Um
Turn 98, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . And it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little {disfmarker} slightly simpler .
Turn 99, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 100, B (Professor): So {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I would put that one also as a {disfmarker} as a maybe . Uh and it {disfmarker} yeah and it 's actually {vocalsound} does {disfmarker} does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian , so s and little worse on the mis on the MM case , but uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things
Turn 101, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 102, B (Professor): so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their {disfmarker} their measure and {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are we running this uh for TI - digits or uh
Turn 103, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 104, B (Professor): Now is TI di {disfmarker} is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development {disfmarker} th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of {disfmarker} end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?
Turn 105, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . It 's included , yeah .
Turn 106, B (Professor): Oh OK . OK . And see what else there is here . Um Oh I see {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker} I was looking down here at the {disfmarker} the o the row below the lower yellowed one . Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size {disfmarker} reduced dimensionality .
Turn 107, C (PhD): Mm - hmm ? Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 108, B (Professor): What happens there is it 's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .
Turn 109, C (PhD): Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's significantly worse well but {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .
Turn 110, B (Professor): It 's significantly worse {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh it 's {disfmarker} it 's mostly worse .
Turn 111, C (PhD): Exc - except for the HM
Turn 112, D (PhD): For many a mismatch it 's worse .
Turn 113, C (PhD): but
Turn 114, B (Professor): Yeah . But it is little . I mean not {disfmarker} not by a huge amount , I don't know . What are {disfmarker} what are the sizes of any of these sets , I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . So {disfmarker} you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?
Turn 115, C (PhD): Uh
Turn 116, D (PhD): I don't remember .
Turn 117, B (Professor): About ?
Turn 118, C (PhD): Um it 's {disfmarker} it depends {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least .
Turn 119, D (PhD): Ye But words {disfmarker} well word {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 120, C (PhD): Hmm ? The words , yeah . S sentences .
Turn 121, D (PhD): Sentences .
Turn 122, C (PhD): Some sets have five hundred sentences , so .
Turn 123, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 124, B (Professor): So the {disfmarker} so the sets {disfmarker} so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say
Turn 125, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 126, B (Professor): and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it {disfmarker} most of them longer or
Turn 127, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 128, D (PhD): Yeah for the Italian even seven digits y more or less
Turn 129, C (PhD): It {disfmarker} it d Seven digits .
Turn 130, D (PhD): but sometime the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that .
Turn 131, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . Right , so between one and sixteen . See the {disfmarker} I mean the reason I 'm asking is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?
Turn 132, C (PhD): Mm - hmm ?
Turn 133, B (Professor): So uh i if {disfmarker} if you had uh just you know {disfmarker} to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a {disfmarker} a tenth of a percent would just be one word ,
Turn 134, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 135, B (Professor): right ? So {disfmarker} so it wouldn't mean anything .
Turn 136, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 137, B (Professor): Oh
Turn 138, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 139, B (Professor): um so um yeah it be kind of {disfmarker} I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually .
Turn 140, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 141, D (PhD): The size that we have ?
Turn 142, C (PhD): We could {disfmarker} we could run {disfmarker} run some kind of significance tests
Turn 143, B (Professor): Yeah since these {disfmarker} well also just to know the numbers ,
Turn 144, C (PhD): or
Turn 145, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 146, B (Professor): right . So these {disfmarker} these are word error rates
Turn 147, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 148, B (Professor): so this is on how many words .
Turn 149, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 150, D (PhD): Yeah we have the result that the output of the HTK
Turn 151, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 152, D (PhD): The number of {disfmarker} of sentences , no it 's the number isn't .
Turn 153, C (PhD): Yeah sure {disfmarker} sure . Yeah sure .
Turn 154, B (Professor): Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that be great .
Turn 155, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 156, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 157, B (Professor): Um {vocalsound} what else is there here ? Um see the second {disfmarker} second from the bottom it says SIL , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or {disfmarker} what was that ?
Turn 158, C (PhD): Uh
Turn 159, D (PhD): It the {disfmarker} the output silence of the MLP .
Turn 160, C (PhD): Oh yeah I see .
Turn 161, D (PhD): It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . To apply also to in include also the {disfmarker} the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those .
Turn 162, B (Professor): Yes . Uh - huh , uh - huh . The silence plus the KLT output ? Oh so you 're only using the silence .
Turn 163, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 164, D (PhD): Yeah , because when we apply the KLT
Turn 165, C (PhD): No they 're {disfmarker} I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs
Turn 166, B (Professor): No .
Turn 167, D (PhD): in addition , yes .
Turn 168, C (PhD): it is because we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT
Turn 169, D (PhD): In addition t
Turn 170, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 171, D (PhD): and we not s we are not sure if we pick {disfmarker} we have the silence .
Turn 172, C (PhD): So we try to add the silence also in addition to the {disfmarker} these twenty - eight dimensions .
Turn 173, B (Professor): I see . OK . And what {disfmarker} and what 's OGI forty - five ? The bottom one there ?
Turn 174, C (PhD): Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th it 's the features from the first line
Turn 175, D (PhD): It 's in fact OGI two .
Turn 176, B (Professor): S
Turn 177, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 178, B (Professor): Right , but I mean what 's the {disfmarker} what does the last row mean ?
Turn 179, C (PhD): So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT on the {disfmarker} from the left path .
Turn 180, B (Professor): I thought that was the one {disfmarker} I thought that was the second row . So what 's the difference between the second
Turn 181, C (PhD): Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just
Turn 182, B (Professor): Oh .
Turn 183, C (PhD): uh
Turn 184, B (Professor): So this is like the second line but with {disfmarker} with the combo stuff .
Turn 185, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 186, D (PhD): And with the {disfmarker} all the output of the combo .
Turn 187, B (Professor): OK . Yeah .
Turn 188, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 189, D (PhD): Uh
Turn 190, B (Professor): OK , so {disfmarker} alright so it looks to me {disfmarker} I guess the same {disfmarker} given that we have to take the filt ones out of the {disfmarker} the running because of this delay problem {disfmarker} so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are {disfmarker} are the ones to look at
Turn 191, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 192, B (Professor): but I just would add the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the second row one
Turn 193, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 194, B (Professor): and then um if we can um
Turn 195, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 196, B (Professor): oh yeah also when {disfmarker} when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?
Turn 197, C (PhD): Uh {vocalsound} I guess , yeah .
Turn 198, B (Professor): Yeah OK .
Turn 199, C (PhD): I guess , yeah . Mmm .
Turn 200, B (Professor): Alright .
Turn 201, C (PhD): It 's not clear here .
Turn 202, B (Professor): OK . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe they 'll argue about it . Um OK so if we can know what {disfmarker} how many words are in each and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten {vocalsound} Friday
Turn 203, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 204, B (Professor): and then we 'll operate with that
Turn 205, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 206, B (Professor): and uh how long did it I guess if we 're not doing all these things {disfmarker} if we 're only doing um um I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one , right ? I mean ordinarily if {disfmarker} in final test data you don't want to do several and {disfmarker} and take the best
Turn 207, C (PhD): Yeah . Mmm .
Turn 208, B (Professor): that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's not proper but if this is development data we could still look at a couple .
Turn 209, C (PhD): Yeah . We can {disfmarker} yeah . Sure . But we have to decide {disfmarker} I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best
Turn 210, B (Professor): Yeah . I Right .
Turn 211, C (PhD): and these
Turn 212, B (Professor): But the question is when {disfmarker} when do we fix the system ,
Turn 213, C (PhD): But we could
Turn 214, B (Professor): do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ?
Turn 215, C (PhD): it d
Turn 216, B (Professor): I {disfmarker} Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up .
Turn 217, C (PhD): I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 218, B (Professor): Also , so
Turn 219, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 220, B (Professor): Um
Turn 221, C (PhD): Uh yeah well . Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some {disfmarker} some other @ @ .
Turn 222, B (Professor): Right so maybe what we do is we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth
Turn 223, C (PhD): Yeah but Mm - hmm .
Turn 224, B (Professor): but we start the write - up right away because as you say there {disfmarker} there 's only minor differences between these .
Turn 225, C (PhD): I think you {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} we could start soon , yeah .
Turn 226, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 227, C (PhD): Write up something .
Turn 228, B (Professor): Yeah , and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} you know , I would {disfmarker} I 'd kind of like to see it
Turn 229, C (PhD): Um yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 230, B (Professor): maybe I can {disfmarker} I can edit it a bit uh sure . The {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English .
Turn 231, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 232, B (Professor): Uh so
Turn 233, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 234, B (Professor): uh H yeah . Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?
Turn 235, C (PhD): Uh not really .
Turn 236, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 237, C (PhD): Um There is the format of the table which is {vocalsound} quite impressive .
Turn 238, B (Professor): Yeah ? Uh I see . Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . It 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . Uh No mitigation . Wow . Do you know what no {disfmarker} what no mitigation means here ?
Turn 239, C (PhD): Um it should be the the problem with the error {disfmarker} channel error
Turn 240, B (Professor): Oh that 's probably the {disfmarker}
Turn 241, C (PhD): or
Turn 242, B (Professor): this is probably channel error stuff
Turn 243, C (PhD): well , you {disfmarker}
Turn 244, B (Professor): huh ? Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel {disfmarker} channel error resilience ,
Turn 245, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 246, B (Professor): yeah . So recognition performance is just the top part , actually . Uh and they have {disfmarker} yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and {disfmarker} and evaluation .
Turn 247, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 248, B (Professor): And {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen . Multi - condition {disfmarker} multi - condition . So they have {disfmarker} looks like they have uh uh
Turn 249, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 250, B (Professor): so they splitting up between the TI - digits and everything else , I see . So the everything else is the SpeechDat - Car , that 's the multi multilingual
Turn 251, C (PhD): Yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or {disfmarker}
Turn 252, B (Professor): Well , it is .
Turn 253, C (PhD): it just
Turn 254, B (Professor): It is , but there 's also {disfmarker} there 's these tables over here for the {disfmarker} for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data which is {disfmarker} which is I guess all the multilingual stuff
Turn 255, C (PhD): Oh yeah .
Turn 256, B (Professor): and then uh there 's {disfmarker} they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .
Turn 257, C (PhD): Yeah . For TI - digits .
Turn 258, B (Professor): Yes .
Turn 259, C (PhD): Yeah , actually yeah . For the TI - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy
Turn 260, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 261, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 262, B (Professor): So we 're doing that also , I guess .
Turn 263, C (PhD): Uh yeah . But uh we actually {disfmarker} do we have the features ? Yeah . For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . Uh the clean training stuff .
Turn 264, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 265, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 266, B (Professor): Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to {vocalsound} work with our partners to fill out the tables {vocalsound} over the next uh next few days
Turn 267, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 268, D (PhD): Yes .
Turn 269, B (Professor): I guess they have to send it out {disfmarker} let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh Wednesday and I think the {disfmarker} it has to be there by some hour uh European time on Wednesday
Turn 270, C (PhD): Hmm - hmm .
Turn 271, B (Professor): so {vocalsound} I think basically
Turn 272, D (PhD): We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because {vocalsound} that the difference in the time may be {disfmarker} is a long different of the time .
Turn 273, B (Professor): E excuse me ?
Turn 274, D (PhD): Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one is {disfmarker} is not valid in Europe .
Turn 275, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 276, D (PhD): We don't know is happening .
Turn 277, B (Professor): Yes , so I mean {disfmarker} I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday
Turn 278, D (PhD): Tuesday .
Turn 279, B (Professor): right because I {disfmarker} I think
Turn 280, C (PhD): Yeah , well .
Turn 281, B (Professor): uh Uh
Turn 282, C (PhD): Except if {disfmarker} if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or I don't know {disfmarker} we can {vocalsound} still do some work on Wednesday morning .
Turn 283, B (Professor): yeah well . W i is but is {disfmarker} is it midni I thought it was actually something like five PM on {disfmarker}
Turn 284, C (PhD): Yeah , well . Yeah .
Turn 285, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 286, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 287, B (Professor): was like {disfmarker} I thought it was five PM or something , I didn't think it was midnight . I thought they said they wanted everything by
Turn 288, D (PhD): Yeah , five PM .
Turn 289, B (Professor): well , so five PM their time is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} if
Turn 290, D (PhD): Not five PM , three PM .
Turn 291, B (Professor): three PM .
Turn 292, D (PhD): Three PM .
Turn 293, B (Professor): Alright , that 's six in the morning here .
Turn 294, C (PhD): It 's d no .
Turn 295, D (PhD): Uh no three {disfmarker} three A - three PM ?
Turn 296, C (PhD): No , we are wondering about the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the hour that we have to eh I don't know if it 's three PM {disfmarker} it 's
Turn 297, D (PhD): Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Three PM here is in Europe midnight .
Turn 298, C (PhD): Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's midnight but
Turn 299, B (Professor): Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due , I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something .
Turn 300, D (PhD): Oh OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , 
Turn 301, B (Professor): In which case
Turn 302, D (PhD): maybe .
Turn 303, B (Professor): so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday . Um so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath
Turn 304, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 305, B (Professor): but then {disfmarker} then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish
Turn 306, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 307, B (Professor): but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed
Turn 308, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 309, B (Professor): so all we 'll do is take whatever {vocalsound} they have and {disfmarker} and uh and run it through the process .
Turn 310, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 311, B (Professor): Uh we won't be changing the training on anything
Turn 312, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 313, B (Professor): so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs , so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after {disfmarker} after Tuesday and {disfmarker} and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research .
Turn 314, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 315, B (Professor): Um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on uh uh so
Turn 316, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 317, B (Professor): What ?
Turn 318, A (Grad): Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas and {disfmarker} oh , but uh we don't have time .
Turn 319, C (PhD): Sure .
Turn 320, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 321, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 322, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 323, C (PhD): I 'm not sure these are great ideas .
Turn 324, B (Professor): But they 're ideas . Yeah ? Oh , that was good .
Turn 325, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 326, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 327, B (Professor): And {disfmarker} and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features
Turn 328, C (PhD): But
Turn 329, B (Professor): rather than uh in sequence which was {disfmarker} was your suggestion and that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems to have been borne out .
Turn 330, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 331, B (Professor): The fact that none of these are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} you know , enormous is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is not too surprising {disfmarker} most improvements aren't enormous and {vocalsound} uh
Turn 332, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 333, B (Professor): some of them are but uh I mean you have something really really wrong {vocalsound} and you fix it {vocalsound} you can get big and really enormous improvements
Turn 334, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 335, B (Professor): but {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} um Cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but Anyway OK well I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there {disfmarker} is there anything else we should talk about or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} are we done ?
Turn 336, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . I think it 's OK um . We so basically we will {disfmarker} I think we 'll try to {disfmarker} to focus on these three architectures and {disfmarker} and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just {disfmarker} just a single KLT because we did not really test that {disfmarker}
Turn 337, B (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 338, C (PhD): removing all these KLT 's and putting one single KLT at the end .
Turn 339, B (Professor): Yeah , I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .
Turn 340, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 341, B (Professor): Uh if you can fit it in .
Turn 342, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 343, B (Professor): Oh I have {disfmarker} yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands
Turn 344, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 345, B (Professor): and {disfmarker} and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or {disfmarker} I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if {disfmarker} you know he 's got a lot of processing power and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna {disfmarker} wanna {disfmarker} wanna run them he 's {disfmarker} he 's offering it .
Turn 346, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 347, B (Professor): So . It 's uh when he was here eh uh he {disfmarker} he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell , so {disfmarker} so in some ways he just got his payback , but uh again I {disfmarker} I don't know if we 'll end up with {disfmarker} if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group
Turn 348, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 349, B (Professor): but {disfmarker} but if {disfmarker} if we are that 's an offer . OK well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's really neat and uh we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get {disfmarker} are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's {disfmarker} that 's another source of data . Um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can {disfmarker} we can make measurements of the room the {disfmarker} uh that {disfmarker} you know if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago so uh that 's another {disfmarker} another possibility for this {disfmarker} this kind of work .
Turn 350, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 351, B (Professor): K , uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do {disfmarker} do our digits {disfmarker} do our digits duty . OK . OK I 'll start . Uh , let me say that again . OK . I guess we 're done .
