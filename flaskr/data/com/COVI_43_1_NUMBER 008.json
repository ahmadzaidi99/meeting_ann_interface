They must speak slowly and clearly at all times in order to help the interpreters. I cannot emphasize that enough. The interpreters work hard: they have to listen to what members are saying and then interpret their words. That is not always easy, especially when members reply to a question quickly or ask a question quickly.\n              Finally, we strongly recommend that those who are going to speak use a headset. We would be grateful for that. Yesterday, I noticed that almost everyone was wearing a headset and that everyone who spoke was wearing one. Hon. members and the interpreters are grateful to them for that.\n              \n              We'll now proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand there are no ministerial announcements today. We'll proceed then to the presentation of petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.

One of them also is for motion M-1. Mr. Julian will be glad to hear that people from Guelph are also signing on to that petition.

His wife suffers from a serious illness and needs the supply of medications to be uninterrupted. They are concerned. There is some unrest in the United States and some Americans have said that they should perhaps come to buy their medications in Canada.

With so much corporate and investor ownership of licences, we want to make sure that government, in that funding, makes sure that it goes to those who need it. and not those who don't.\n              The petition is with regard to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, which provided 20 recommendations to government last May. The consultations with independent fish harvesters, community organizations and industry identified the need for transparent fishing licensing and quota ownership. It is currently not known where the benefits are, or if fishery resources are truly flowing. Some of them are foreign owned, and we don't even know who owns the fish licences.\n               Right now this is certainly more important than ever. Many of the fish harvesters are locked into agreements based on last year's prices, and they're going to be bankrupt before they even leave the dock. We're disappointed that this wasn't addressed. They're calling on the government to commit to a timeline and a plan that respects and addresses the 20 recommendations laid out in the House of Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans report entitled “West Coast Fisheries: Sharing Risks and Benefits”.

Our health networks are under stress. For example, to understand the virulence of this contagion, when Quebec declared a state of health emergency, on March 13—it was the first to do so—there were 17 cases in Quebec and no deaths. In Canada, there were 176 cases and one death. Today, two months later, Quebec will exceed 40,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. In Canada, there are more than 72,000 cases and more than 5,000 deaths.\n              All the experts who have testified before the Standing Committee on Health have told us that, going forward, one of the great lessons that we must learn from the pandemic against which we are fighting, is that the chronic underfunding of health networks leads to weak links and makes dealing with pandemics of this kind difficult. \n              When will the Minister announce that health transfers have been put back to 6%, as was the case before Mr. Harper's Conservatives reduced them to 3%?"}, {"turn": 33, "speakerID": "261638", "name": "Hon.

We are working in close collaboration with others.\n              At the same time as we are holding a virtual sitting of Parliament, the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are providing their assistance to seniors in Quebec and Ontario. Let me take this opportunity to thank them.\n              As for health funding, we have increased the funds for the provinces and territories by $500 million in order to help them prepare to fight COVID-19.

Meanwhile, $500 million out of the $150 billion represents only $0.33 per $100 invested in all the other programs.\n              It is not right that the government is not injecting funds now, so that people working on the front lines can fight the pandemic appropriately.

That amount is not to be laughed at. It does not include the 75% wage subsidy that the company is receiving.\n              I would like to know why the minister did not take that opportunity to require that, in return, the company reimburse the thousands of Quebeckers who are being held hostage by those travel credits."}, {"turn": 250, "speakerID": "261641", "name": "Hon.

It is a very complex situation and we must help our airlines.\n               At the same time, as I mentioned, I understand that people are frustrated, but they know that they will be able to use the credit for a flight over the next two years."}, {"turn": 255, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "The next question goes to Mr. Mazier."}, {"turn": 256, "speakerID": "261728", "name": "Mr. Dan Mazier (Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n              Mr. Chair, many people in my rural Manitoba riding are feeling unfairly impacted by the Liberal government's firearms ban. These citizens are law-abiding firearms owners who safely, responsibly and legally use firearms. Not only was this order in council signed behind closed doors without any democratic debate, it also does not address the criminal use of firearms.

They were designed for soldiers to use while engaged in combat. Nothing we have done in any way impacts the legitimate, law-abiding activity of hunters and farmers and sport shooters across this country.

There are standards for the ammunition and armaments.
