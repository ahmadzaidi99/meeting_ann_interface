Turn 0, G (Grad): Time .
Turn 1, C (Grad): Thanks .
Turn 2, G (Grad): Are you Fey ?
Turn 3, D (Undergrad): I am Fey , yeah .
Turn 4, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 5, B (Grad): What day is today ?
Turn 6, D (Undergrad): Hi .
Turn 7, G (Grad): Hi . I think we 've met before , like , I remember talking to you about Aspect or something like that at some point or other .
Turn 8, D (Undergrad): A couple times yeah .
Turn 9, F (Grad): It 's the uh twenty {disfmarker} nineteenth .
Turn 10, B (Grad): Nineteenth ?
Turn 11, D (Undergrad): That 's right , yeah .
Turn 12, G (Grad): So .
Turn 13, D (Undergrad): And you were my GSI briefly , until I dropped the class .
Turn 14, F (Grad): 
Turn 15, B (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 16, G (Grad): Oh that 's right .
Turn 17, D (Undergrad): But .
Turn 18, G (Grad): Well .
Turn 19, C (Grad): OK , wh wh
Turn 20, G (Grad): No offense .
Turn 21, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 22, G (Grad): Like .
Turn 23, C (Grad): OK . Some in some introductions are in order .
Turn 24, G (Grad): Oh , OK sorry .
Turn 25, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 26, G (Grad): Getting ahead of myself .
Turn 27, C (Grad): So . Um . For those who don't know {disfmarker} Everyone knows me , this is great . Um , apart from that , sort of the old gang , Johno and Bhaskara have been with us from {disfmarker} from day one
Turn 28, G (Grad): Yay !
Turn 29, E (Grad): Hi .
Turn 30, C (Grad): and um they 're engaged in {disfmarker} in various activities , some of which you will hear about today . Ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type ,
Turn 31, A (PhD): Well .
Turn 32, E (Grad): Oh wow .
Turn 33, C (Grad): and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper . Is that a good characterization ?
Turn 34, A (PhD): u That 's pretty good , I think .
Turn 35, C (Grad): I don't know .
Turn 36, A (PhD): Yeah . Thanks .
Turn 37, C (Grad): OK . Keith is not technically one of us yet ,
Turn 38, E (Grad): Not yet .
Turn 39, C (Grad): ha - ha . but um it 's too late for him now .
Turn 40, G (Grad): " One of us . "
Turn 41, C (Grad): So .
Turn 42, E (Grad): Yeah right . I 've got the headset on after all .
Turn 43, C (Grad): Um . Officially I guess he will be joining us in the summer .
Turn 44, E (Grad): yes .
Turn 45, C (Grad): And um hopefully it is by {disfmarker} by means of Keith that we will be able to get a b a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is and um how we can make it work for us . Additionally his interest um surpasses um English because it also entails German , an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language . And um , is there anyone who doesn't know Nancy ? Do you {disfmarker} do you know Nancy ?
Turn 46, G (Grad): Me ?
Turn 47, E (Grad): I know Nancy .
Turn 48, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 49, B (Grad): I made that joke already , Nancy , sadly .
Turn 50, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 51, G (Grad): What ?
Turn 52, B (Grad): The " I don't know myself " joke .
Turn 53, G (Grad): You did ? When ?
Turn 54, B (Grad): Uh before you came in .
Turn 55, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 56, E (Grad): Man !
Turn 57, G (Grad): About me or you ?
Turn 58, B (Grad): About me .
Turn 59, G (Grad): OK . {vocalsound} OK .
Turn 60, A (PhD): You could do it about you .
Turn 61, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 62, G (Grad): Well I didn't know . I didn't mean to be humor copying , but OK , sorry . Yes , I know myself . It 's OK .
Turn 63, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 64, G (Grad): It 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 65, C (Grad): And um Fey is with us as of six days ago officially ?
Turn 66, D (Undergrad): Officially ,
Turn 67, C (Grad): Officially ,
Turn 68, D (Undergrad): yeah .
Turn 69, C (Grad): but in reality already um much much longer and um um next to some {disfmarker} some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the {disfmarker} the data collection she 's also the wizard in the data collection Um ,
Turn 70, G (Grad): Of Oz .
Turn 71, D (Undergrad): It 's very exciting .
Turn 72, C (Grad): we 're sticking with the term " wizard " ,
Turn 73, D (Undergrad): Yes .
Turn 74, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 75, D (Undergrad): Yes .
Turn 76, C (Grad): and um
Turn 77, G (Grad): Not witch - like .
Turn 78, B (Grad): Wizardette .
Turn 79, E (Grad): Wizard .
Turn 80, F (Grad): Wizardess .
Turn 81, C (Grad): Sorceress , I think .
Turn 82, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 83, D (Undergrad): Wizard .
Turn 84, C (Grad): wizard uh by by popular vote
Turn 85, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 86, C (Grad): um
Turn 87, G (Grad): Didn't take a vote ? OK .
Turn 88, C (Grad): OK , um , why don't we get started on that subject anyways . Um , so we 're about to collect data and um the uh s the following things have happened since we last met . When will we three meet again ? And um
Turn 89, G (Grad): More than three of us .
Turn 90, C (Grad): what happened is that um , " A " , {comment} there was some confusion between you and Jerry with the {disfmarker} that leading to your talking to Catherine Snow , and he was uh he {disfmarker} he agreed completely that some something confusing happened . Um his idea was to get sort of the l the lists of mayors of the department , the students . It {disfmarker} it 's exactly how you interpreted it , sort of s
Turn 91, E (Grad): The list of majors in the department ?
Turn 92, D (Undergrad): M m Majors ?
Turn 93, C (Grad): Ma - majors , majors .
Turn 94, D (Undergrad): Majors ?
Turn 95, C (Grad): " Mayors " .
Turn 96, D (Undergrad): OK , mayor {disfmarker}
Turn 97, C (Grad): Majors .
Turn 98, D (Undergrad): Something I don't know about these
Turn 99, G (Grad): The department has many mayors .
Turn 100, C (Grad): Majors and um just sending the {disfmarker} the little write - up that we did on to those email lists
Turn 101, D (Undergrad): OK . OK . Yeah , yeah , yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 102, C (Grad): uh {disfmarker}
Turn 103, D (Undergrad): So it was really Carol Snow who was confused , not me and not Jerry .
Turn 104, C (Grad): Yep , yep , yep . OK . So . So , that is uh {disfmarker}
Turn 105, D (Undergrad): That 's good . So I should still do that .
Turn 106, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 107, D (Undergrad): OK .
Turn 108, C (Grad): And {disfmarker}
Turn 109, D (Undergrad): And using the thing that you wrote up .
Turn 110, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 111, D (Undergrad): OK .
Turn 112, C (Grad): Wonderful . And um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact Fey for you know recruiting them for our thing and um there was some confusion as to the consent form , which is basically that {disfmarker} that what what you just signed
Turn 113, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 114, C (Grad): and since we have one already um {disfmarker}
Turn 115, G (Grad): Did Jerry talk to you about maybe using our class ? the students in the undergrad class that he 's teaching ?
Turn 116, C (Grad): Um well he said um we {disfmarker} definitely " yes " ,
Turn 117, G (Grad): e
Turn 118, C (Grad): however there is always more people in a {disfmarker} in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment
Turn 119, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 120, C (Grad): and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all .
Turn 121, G (Grad): OK , but th I guess it 's that um people in his class cover a different set so {disfmarker} than the c is the CogSci department that you were talking about ?
Turn 122, D (Undergrad): I guess . See
Turn 123, G (Grad): uh reaching out to ?
Turn 124, D (Undergrad): that 's what I suggested to him , that people like {disfmarker} like Jerry and George and et cetera just {disfmarker}
Turn 125, G (Grad): Cuz we have you know people from other areas
Turn 126, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 127, G (Grad): advertise in their classes as well .
Turn 128, D (Undergrad): Yeah or even I could {disfmarker} you know I could do the actual {disfmarker}
Turn 129, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 130, G (Grad): Cuz I mean I {disfmarker} I know how to contact our students ,
Turn 131, D (Undergrad): That 's generally the way it 's done .
Turn 132, G (Grad): so if there 's something that you 're sending out you can also s um send me a copy ,
Turn 133, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 134, G (Grad): me or Bhaskara could {disfmarker} either of us could post it to uh is it {disfmarker}
Turn 135, D (Undergrad): A mailing list .
Turn 136, G (Grad): if it 's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro post it to the news group
Turn 137, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 138, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 139, G (Grad): so .
Turn 140, C (Grad): Do it . Yeah .
Turn 141, D (Undergrad): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 142, G (Grad): OK , so you 'll send it or something so .
Turn 143, C (Grad): As a matter of fact , if you {disfmarker}
Turn 144, D (Undergrad): I can send it .
Turn 145, C (Grad): if {disfmarker}
Turn 146, D (Undergrad): I 'll send it ,
Turn 147, G (Grad): You can send it to me .
Turn 148, C (Grad): Now , i
Turn 149, D (Undergrad): yeah .
Turn 150, G (Grad): OK . Don't worry , we {disfmarker} this doesn't concern you anymore , Robert .
Turn 151, C (Grad): How {disfmarker} however I suggest that if you {disfmarker} if you look at your email carefully you may think {disfmarker} you may find that you already have it .
Turn 152, G (Grad): It 's fine . Oops . Already ? Really ?
Turn 153, C (Grad): Maybe .
Turn 154, D (Undergrad): Probab
Turn 155, G (Grad): Oops .
Turn 156, C (Grad): OK . W we 'll see .
Turn 157, G (Grad): I don't remember getting anything .
Turn 158, C (Grad): Anyhow , um the uh Yeah , not only Also we will talk about Linguistics and of course Computer Science .
Turn 159, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 160, C (Grad): Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,
Turn 161, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 162, C (Grad): and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid that , and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the {disfmarker} the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those , and um there the idea is now that next actually we {disfmarker} we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it {disfmarker} it 's getting more complicated . So if you know anyone interested in {disfmarker} in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to {disfmarker} to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast . Um {vocalsound} the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks " go shopping " um " take in uh a batch of art " um " visit {disfmarker} do some sightseeing " blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what Fey has started in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in compiling {disfmarker} compiling here and already {disfmarker} she has already gone to the trouble of {disfmarker} of anchoring it with specific um o {comment} um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . And um . So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if {disfmarker} if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide " OK , I wanna do that at this place " , sort of make up their own itinerary a and {disfmarker} and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with {disfmarker} with symbols for the objects . And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that " ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here " and " I wanted to maybe take a picture of that " and " maybe um eat here " and then goes in and solves the task with the system , IE {comment} Fey , and um and we 're gonna try out that {disfmarker} Any questions ?
Turn 163, G (Grad): so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was {disfmarker} so you still have the {disfmarker} the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ?
Turn 164, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 165, G (Grad): But they will um {disfmarker} There 's nothing that says you know " these are the things you want to do " so they 'll say " well these are the things I want to do " and {disfmarker} Right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?
Turn 166, C (Grad): Hopefully .
Turn 167, G (Grad): OK . Mm - hmm .
Turn 168, F (Grad): So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ?
Turn 169, C (Grad): Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the {disfmarker} that information and An
Turn 170, G (Grad): It w it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way {disfmarker}
Turn 171, C (Grad): N not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not really the street network . Nuh .
Turn 172, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 173, E (Grad): So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?
Turn 174, C (Grad): Yeah a and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their names
Turn 175, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 176, C (Grad): and we want to maybe ask them , if you have {disfmarker} get it sort of isolated street the {disfmarker} the , whatever , " River Street " , and they know that {disfmarker} they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange German names . And then we 're going to have another {disfmarker} we 're gonna have w another trial run IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay for who {disfmarker} those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI . So he 'll {disfmarker} he 's around seven seventy years old , or something .
Turn 177, G (Grad): I didn't know he was the founder . That 's {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 178, C (Grad): And he also approached me and he offered to help {vocalsound} um our project and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks and {vocalsound} I said " sure we need help you can come in as a subject " and he said " OK " . So that 's what 's gonna happen , tomorrow , data .
Turn 179, G (Grad): Using this new {disfmarker} new um plan ,
Turn 180, C (Grad): New {disfmarker} new set up .
Turn 181, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 182, C (Grad): Yeah . Which I 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t But , thanks to Fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that . Questions ? Comments on that ? If not , we can move on . No ? No more questions ?
Turn 183, E (Grad): I 'm not sure I totally understand this
Turn 184, G (Grad): So what 's the s this is what you made , Fey ?
Turn 185, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 186, E (Grad): but {disfmarker} I 'm not sure I totally understand everything that 's being talked about
Turn 187, G (Grad): Like so {disfmarker} So it 's just based on like the materials you had about Heidelberg .
Turn 188, C (Grad): Um are you familiar with {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the very rough setup of the data ?
Turn 189, E (Grad): but I {disfmarker} I imagine I 'll c just catch on .
Turn 190, D (Undergrad): Based on the web site , yeah , at the {disfmarker}
Turn 191, G (Grad): Oh OK there 's a web site
Turn 192, C (Grad): experiment ?
Turn 193, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 194, G (Grad): and then you could like um figure out what the cate
Turn 195, D (Undergrad): It 's a tourist information web site ,
Turn 196, E (Grad): Uh , this is where they 're supposed to {disfmarker}
Turn 197, D (Undergrad): so .
Turn 198, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 199, C (Grad): Talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on .
Turn 200, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 201, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 202, C (Grad): The question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task .
Turn 203, E (Grad): OK . OK . OK .
Turn 204, C (Grad): Because what will happen then is that people repeat {disfmarker} repeat , {comment} or as much as they can , of that phrasing .
Turn 205, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 206, G (Grad): Hmm . Um , are you worried about being able to identify {disfmarker}
Turn 207, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 208, G (Grad): Um . The {disfmarker} The goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this {disfmarker} these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns .
Turn 209, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 210, G (Grad): So it 's like the Enter versus View {disfmarker}
Turn 211, C (Grad): Yeah , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction ,
Turn 212, G (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 213, C (Grad): right ? That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things
Turn 214, G (Grad): Uh - huh . Mm - hmm .
Turn 215, C (Grad): and so th the q first question for the subject is , " so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . Is there anything that interests you ? "
Turn 216, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 217, C (Grad): And the person can say " yeah , sure sh this is something I would do . I would go shopping " . Yeah ? and then we can sort of {disfmarker} this s instructor can say " well , uh then you {disfmarker} you may want to find out how to get over here
Turn 218, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 219, C (Grad): because this is where the shopping district is " .
Turn 220, G (Grad): So the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ?
Turn 221, C (Grad): No . Just sort of {disfmarker} OK , what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what would you like to buy and then um OK there you wanna buy a whatever cuckoos clocks
Turn 222, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 223, C (Grad): OK and the there is a store there .
Turn 224, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 225, C (Grad): So the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there , right ?
Turn 226, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 227, C (Grad): That 's sort of what 's left .
Turn 228, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 229, C (Grad): And we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock .
Turn 230, G (Grad): OK , that 's what I mean so like those tasks are all gonna be um unambiguous about which of the three modes .
Turn 231, C (Grad): Hopefully .
Turn 232, G (Grad): Right . OK . So .
Turn 233, A (PhD): Well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words .
Turn 234, C (Grad): Hopefully .
Turn 235, G (Grad): t {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That they 'll be here ?
Turn 236, C (Grad): Yes . In a sense that 's exactly the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the idea ,
Turn 237, A (PhD): uh uh
Turn 238, C (Grad): which is never possible in a {disfmarker} in a s in a lab situation ,
Turn 239, A (PhD): Well , u u the one experiment th that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that I 've read somewhere , it was {disfmarker} they u used pictures .
Turn 240, C (Grad): nuh ?
Turn 241, A (PhD): So to {disfmarker} to uh actually um uh specify the {disfmarker} the tasks .
Turn 242, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 243, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 244, A (PhD): Uh , but you know i i
Turn 245, C (Grad): Yeah . We had exactly that on our list of possible way things so we {disfmarker} uh I even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here you {disfmarker} you want to know how to get someplace , and this is the place and it 's a museum and you want to do some and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and there 's a person looking at pictures . So , you know , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures .
Turn 246, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 247, C (Grad): However , not only was {disfmarker} the common census were {disfmarker} among all participants of Friday 's meeting was it 's gonna be very laborious to {disfmarker} to make these drawings for each different things ,
Turn 248, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 249, C (Grad): all the different actions , if at all possible , and also people will get caught up in the pictures . So all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .
Turn 250, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 251, C (Grad): And people talking about pictures and pictorial representations
Turn 252, E (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 253, C (Grad): and {disfmarker} um
Turn 254, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 255, C (Grad): I would s I would still be willing to try it .
Turn 256, A (PhD): I mean , I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not saying it 's necessary but {disfmarker} but uh i uh uh i {vocalsound} you might be able to combine you know text uh and {disfmarker} and some sort of picture and also uh I think it {disfmarker} it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the text away
Turn 257, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 258, A (PhD): so that they are not uh guided by {disfmarker} by by what you wrote ,
Turn 259, C (Grad): We will {disfmarker}
Turn 260, A (PhD): but can come up with their {disfmarker} with their own {disfmarker}
Turn 261, C (Grad): Yeah , they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room .
Turn 262, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 263, C (Grad): OK . Then I suggest we move on to the {disfmarker} to we have um uh the EDU Project , let me make one more general remark , has sort of two {disfmarker} two side uh um actions , its um action items that we 're do dealing with , one is modifying the SmartKom parser and the other one is modifying the SmartKom natural language generation module . And um this is not too complicated but I 'm just mentioning it {disfmarker} put it in the framework because this is something we will talk about now . Um , I have some news from the generation , do you have news from the parser ?
Turn 264, F (Grad): Um , not {disfmarker}
Turn 265, C (Grad): By that look I {disfmarker}
Turn 266, F (Grad): Yes , uh , I would really p It would be better if I talked about it on Friday .
Turn 267, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 268, F (Grad): If that 's OK .
Turn 269, C (Grad): Yeah , wonderful . Um , did you run into problems or did you run into not h having time ?
Turn 270, F (Grad): Yeah . But not {disfmarker} not any time part .
Turn 271, C (Grad): OK , so that 's good . That 's better than running into problems .
Turn 272, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 273, C (Grad): And um I {disfmarker} I do have some good news for the natural language generation however . And the good news is I guess it 's done . Uh , meaning that Tilman Becker , who does the German one , actually took out some time and already did it in English for us . And so the version he 's sending us is already producing the English that 's needed to get by in version one point one .
Turn 274, F (Grad): So I take it that was similar to the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what we did for the parsing ?
Turn 275, C (Grad): Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words ,
Turn 276, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 277, C (Grad): but it would have been
Turn 278, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 279, C (Grad): but this {disfmarker} this is I guess good news , and the uh {disfmarker} the time and especially Bhaskara and uh {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} Oh do I have it here ? No . The time is now pretty much fixed . It 's the last week of April until the fourth of May so it 's twenty - sixth through fourth . That they 'll be here . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time .
Turn 280, B (Grad): Wait , what {disfmarker} what are the days ? April twenty - sixth to the {disfmarker} May fourth ?
Turn 281, C (Grad): Yeah , something like that .
Turn 282, B (Grad): I 'll probably be here .
Turn 283, C (Grad): It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 284, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 285, E (Grad): You will be here .
Turn 286, C (Grad): There is a d Isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that ?
Turn 287, F (Grad): Finals was that .
Turn 288, G (Grad): Yeah w it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students but final projects might .
Turn 289, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 290, F (Grad): Yeah actually , that 's true .
Turn 291, G (Grad): That {disfmarker}
Turn 292, C (Grad): Anyway , so this is {disfmarker}
Turn 293, B (Grad): Well I 'll be here working on something . Guaranteed , it 's just uh will I be here , you know , in uh {disfmarker} I 'll be here too actually but {disfmarker}
Turn 294, A (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 295, C (Grad): No it 's just um you know they 're coming for us so that we can bug them
Turn 296, G (Grad): Ye
Turn 297, C (Grad): and ask them more questions and sit down together and write sensible code and they can give some nice talks and stuff . But uh
Turn 298, B (Grad): But it 's not like we need to be with them twenty - four hours a day s for the seven days that they 're here .
Turn 299, C (Grad): just make a {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} not unless you really really want to .
Turn 300, E (Grad): They 're very dependent
Turn 301, C (Grad): Not unless you really want to . And they 're both nice guys so you may {disfmarker} may want to . OK , that much from the parser and generator side , unless there are more questions on that .
Turn 302, G (Grad): So , no sample generator output yet ?
Turn 303, C (Grad): No . It {disfmarker} Just a mail that , you know , he 's sending me the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the stuff soon
Turn 304, G (Grad): OK . This is being sent , mm - hmm . OK .
Turn 305, C (Grad): and I was completely flabbergasted here
Turn 306, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 307, C (Grad): and I {disfmarker} and that 's also it 's {disfmarker} it 's going to produce the concept - to - speech uh blah - blah - blah information for {disfmarker} necessary for one point one in English {disfmarker} based on the English , you know , in English . So . I was like " OK ,
Turn 308, E (Grad): We 're done .
Turn 309, C (Grad): we 're done ! "
Turn 310, G (Grad): So that was like one of the first l You know , the first task was getting it working for English . So that 's basically over now . Is that right ?
Turn 311, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 312, G (Grad): So the basic requirement fulfilled .
Turn 313, C (Grad): Um , the basic requirement is fulfilled almost . When Andreas Stolcke and {disfmarker} and his gang ,
Turn 314, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 315, C (Grad): when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary , then we can actually a put it all together
Turn 316, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . So the speech recognizer also works . Uh - huh . Mm - hmm .
Turn 317, C (Grad): and you can speak into it and ask for TV and movie information
Turn 318, E (Grad): Toll .
Turn 319, C (Grad): and then when if {disfmarker} if something actually happens and some answers come out , then we 're done .
Turn 320, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . If {disfmarker} and they 're kind of correct .
Turn 321, E (Grad): So it 's not done basically .
Turn 322, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 323, G (Grad): And they kind of are {disfmarker} are correct .
Turn 324, E (Grad): Right . Perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example .
Turn 325, G (Grad): It 's not just like anything . And they 're mostly in English . So .
Turn 326, C (Grad): Then um {disfmarker}
Turn 327, G (Grad): Are they {disfmarker} is it using the database ? the German TV movie .
Turn 328, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 329, G (Grad): OK . So {vocalsound} all the actual data might be German names ?
Turn 330, C (Grad): Um well actually th um
Turn 331, G (Grad): Or are they all like American TV programs ?
Turn 332, C (Grad): um well {disfmarker}
Turn 333, E (Grad): I want to see " Die Dukes Von Hazard "
Turn 334, C (Grad): The {disfmarker} OK , so you don't know how the German dialogue {disfmarker} uh the German {disfmarker} the demo dialogue actually works . It works {disfmarker} the first thing is what 's , you know , showing on TV , and then the person is presented with what 's running on TV in Germany on that day , on that evening
Turn 335, G (Grad): Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 336, C (Grad): and so you take one look at it and then you say " well that 's really nothing {disfmarker} there 's nothing for me there " " what 's running in the cinemas ? " So maybe there 's something better happening there .
Turn 337, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 338, C (Grad): And then you get {disfmarker} you 're shown what movies play which films , and it 's gonna be of course all the Heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing .
Turn 339, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 340, C (Grad): And most of them are going to be Hollywood movies . So , " American Beauty " is " American Beauty " ,
Turn 341, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 342, C (Grad): right ? Yeah .
Turn 343, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 344, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 345, C (Grad): And um .
Turn 346, G (Grad): But they 're shown like on a screen .
Turn 347, C (Grad): N
Turn 348, G (Grad): It 's a {disfmarker} I mean so would the generator , like the English language sentence of it is {disfmarker} " these are the follow you know the following films are being shown " or something like that ?
Turn 349, C (Grad): Yeah , but it in that sense it doesn't make {disfmarker} In that case uh it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud .
Turn 350, G (Grad): S Right .
Turn 351, C (Grad): if you 're displaying them .
Turn 352, G (Grad): So it 'll just display {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 353, C (Grad): But uh it 'll tell you that this is what 's showing in Heidelberg and there you go .
Turn 354, G (Grad): So we don't have to worry about um {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 355, C (Grad): And the presentation agent will go " Hhh ! " {comment} Nuh ?
Turn 356, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 357, C (Grad): Like that {disfmarker} the avatar .
Turn 358, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 359, C (Grad): And um . And then you pick {disfmarker} pick a movie and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it show shows you the times and you pick a time and you pick seats and all of this . So .
Turn 360, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 361, C (Grad): Pretty straightforward .
Turn 362, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 363, C (Grad): But it 's {disfmarker} so this time we {disfmarker} we are at an advantage because it was a problem for the German system to incorporate all these English movie titles .
Turn 364, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 365, C (Grad): Nuh ? But in English , that 's not really a problem ,
Turn 366, G (Grad): Right . Mm - hmm .
Turn 367, C (Grad): unless we get some {disfmarker} some topical German movies that have just come out and that are in their database . So the person may select " Huehner Rennen " or whatever .
Turn 368, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 369, E (Grad): " Chicken Run " .
Turn 370, C (Grad): OK . Then uh on to the modeling . Right ?
Turn 371, B (Grad): Yeah , yeah , I guess .
Turn 372, C (Grad): Um then modeling , there it is .
Turn 373, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 374, E (Grad): OK . What 's the next thing ?
Turn 375, B (Grad): e
Turn 376, C (Grad): This is very rough but this is sort of what um Johno and I managed to come up with . The idea here is that {disfmarker}
Turn 377, B (Grad): This is the uh s the schema of the XML here , not an example or something like that .
Turn 378, C (Grad): Yeah this is not an XML this is sort of towards an {disfmarker} a schema ,
Turn 379, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 380, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 381, C (Grad): nuh ? definition . The idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema such as the Source - Path - Goal and then we have forced uh motion , we have cost action ,
Turn 382, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 383, C (Grad): we have a whole library of schemas .
Turn 384, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 385, C (Grad): And they 're gonna be , you know , fleshed out in {disfmarker} in their real ugly detail , Source - Path - Goal , and there 's gonna be s a lot of stuff on the Goal and blah - blah - blah , that a goal can be and so forth . What we think is {disfmarker} And all the names could {disfmarker} should be taken " cum grano salis " . So . This is a {disfmarker} the fact that we 're calling this " action schema " right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this " action schema " . But what that means {vocalsound} is we have here first of all on the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the first iteration a stupid list of Source - Path - Goal actions
Turn 386, B (Grad): Actions that can be categorized with {disfmarker} or that are related to Source - Path - Goal .
Turn 387, C (Grad): wi to that schema
Turn 388, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 389, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 390, C (Grad): and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions .
Turn 391, B (Grad): And then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary .
Turn 392, C (Grad): So a push may be in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in both you know push uh in this or this uh {disfmarker}
Turn 393, G (Grad): Forced motion and caused action for instance ,
Turn 394, C (Grad): Exactly . Yeah .
Turn 395, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 396, C (Grad): Also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future . So this is something that , you know , may also be a res As a result of your work in the future , we may find out that , you know , there 're really s these subtle differences between um even within the domain of entering in the light of a Source - Path - Goal schema , that we need to put in {disfmarker} fill in additional structure up there . But it gives us a nice handle . So with this we can basically um you know s slaughter the cow any anyway we want . Uh . It {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} It was sort of a {disfmarker} it gave us some headache , how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the Enter Source - Path - Goal that this {disfmarker} But this sort of gets the job done in that respect and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we 're talking about two different things . We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there , and more on the {disfmarker} this is the {disfmarker} your basic bone um schema , down there .
Turn 397, B (Grad): Uh one question , Robert . When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ?
Turn 398, G (Grad): Yeah . It 's the shadow .
Turn 399, B (Grad): OK . Whereas I keep looking where your hand is , and it doesn't {disfmarker}
Turn 400, C (Grad): Well , that wouldn't have helped you at all .
Turn 401, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 402, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 403, B (Grad): Basically , what this is {disfmarker} is that there 's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner
Turn 404, E (Grad): Spit right here .
Turn 405, B (Grad): and right now the way the interface is " action go " and then they have the {disfmarker} what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on .
Turn 406, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 407, B (Grad): And the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type " going into " , goes of type " want to go to a place where I can take a picture of " , et cetera .
Turn 408, C (Grad): So this is sort of what it looks like now , some simple " Go " action from it {disfmarker} from an object named " Peter 's Kirche " of the type " Church " to an object named " Powder - Tower " of the type " Tower " . Right ?
Turn 409, G (Grad): This is the uh {disfmarker} what the action planner uses ?
Turn 410, B (Grad): Right . Currently .
Turn 411, G (Grad): This is {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 412, C (Grad): Currently .
Turn 413, G (Grad): And is that {disfmarker} and tha that 's changeable ? or not ?
Turn 414, C (Grad): Yeah , well {disfmarker}
Turn 415, G (Grad): Like are we adapting to it ?
Turn 416, C (Grad): No .
Turn 417, G (Grad): Or {disfmarker}
Turn 418, C (Grad): We {disfmarker} This is the output , sort of , of the natural language understanding ,
Turn 419, G (Grad): Oh , yeah .
Turn 420, C (Grad): right ?
Turn 421, G (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 422, C (Grad): the input into the action planning , as it is now .
Turn 423, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 424, C (Grad): And what we are going to do , we going to {disfmarker} and you can see here , and again for Johno please {disfmarker} please focus the shadow ,
Turn 425, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 426, C (Grad): um we 're gon uh uh here you have the action and the domain object and w and on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker}
Turn 427, G (Grad): What did you think he was doing ?
Turn 428, B (Grad): I just {disfmarker}
Turn 429, G (Grad): OK , sorry .
Turn 430, E (Grad): A laser pointer would be most appropriate here I think .
Turn 431, C (Grad): Yeah I {disfmarker} I um have {disfmarker} I have no {disfmarker}
Turn 432, D (Undergrad): Eee .
Turn 433, B (Grad): Robert likes to be abstract and that 's what I just thought he was doing .
Turn 434, G (Grad): You look up here .
Turn 435, C (Grad): Sort of between here and here ,
Turn 436, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 437, C (Grad): so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um " Struct " , if you want , IE a rich action description on that level .
Turn 438, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 439, C (Grad): So in the future {disfmarker}
Turn 440, G (Grad): So it 's just an additional information {disfmarker}
Turn 441, C (Grad): Exactly . In the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an {disfmarker} an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,
Turn 442, G (Grad): Right ? that doesn't hurt the current way . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 443, B (Grad): Which {disfmarker} which we 're abbreviating as " RAD " .
Turn 444, C (Grad): which is {disfmarker}
Turn 445, G (Grad): Good .
Turn 446, E (Grad): Rad !
Turn 447, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 448, F (Grad): So um you had like an action schema and a Source - Path - Goal schema ,
Turn 449, G (Grad): Hmm . Hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 450, F (Grad): right ? So how does this Source - Path - Goal schema fit into the uh action schema ? Like is it one of the tags there ?
Turn 451, G (Grad): Yeah can you go back to that one ?
Turn 452, B (Grad): So the Source - Path - Goal schema in this case , I 've {disfmarker} if I understand how we described {disfmarker} we set this up , um cuz we 've been arguing about it all week , but uh we 'll hold the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} Well in this case it will hold the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean the {disfmarker} the features I guess . I 'm not {disfmarker} it 's hard for me to exactly s So basically that will store the {disfmarker} the object that is w the Source will store the object that we 're going from , the Goal will store the {disfmarker} the f
Turn 453, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 454, G (Grad): So the fillers of the role source .
Turn 455, B (Grad): we 'll fill those in fill those roles in , right ?
Turn 456, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 457, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 458, B (Grad): The S Action - schemas basically have extra {disfmarker} See we {disfmarker} so those are {disfmarker} schemas exist because in case we need extra information instead of just making it an attribute and which {disfmarker} which is just one thing we {disfmarker} we decided to make it 's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that {disfmarker} that we need to exploit .
Turn 459, G (Grad): OK , so th sorry I just don't kn um um um {disfmarker} This is just uh XML mo notational but um the fact that it 's action schema and then sort of slash action schema that 's a whole entit
Turn 460, B (Grad): That 's a block , yeah .
Turn 461, G (Grad): That 's a block , whereas source is just an attribute ?
Turn 462, C (Grad): No , no , no .
Turn 463, G (Grad): Is that {disfmarker}
Turn 464, C (Grad): Source is just not spelled out here . Source meaning {disfmarker} Source will be uh will have a name , a type , maybe a dimensionality ,
Turn 465, G (Grad): Oh , OK , OK .
Turn 466, C (Grad): maybe canonical uh orientation {disfmarker}
Turn 467, G (Grad): Uh - huh , uh - huh . OK could it {disfmarker} it could also be blocked out then as {disfmarker}
Turn 468, B (Grad): Yeah , the {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}
Turn 469, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 470, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 471, C (Grad): s Source it will be , you know we 'll f we know a lot about sources so we 'll put all of that in Source .
Turn 472, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 473, C (Grad): But it 's independent whether we are using the SPG schema in an Enter , View , or Approach mode , right ?
Turn 474, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 475, C (Grad): This is just properties of the SPG {comment} schema . We can talk about Paths being the fastest , the quickest , the nicest and so forth , uh or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and the Trajector should be coming in there as well .
Turn 476, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 477, C (Grad): And then G the same about Goals .
Turn 478, G (Grad): OK . So I guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out , it 'll be under action schema ? Those are {disfmarker} It 's gonna be one {disfmarker} y you 'll pick one of those for {disfmarker}
Turn 479, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 480, G (Grad): OK these are {disfmarker} this is just a layout of the possible that could go {disfmarker} play that role .
Turn 481, B (Grad): Right , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the roles will be filled in with the schema
Turn 482, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 483, G (Grad): OK , go it . Uh - huh .
Turn 484, B (Grad): and then what actual a action is chosen is {disfmarker} will be in the {disfmarker} in the action schema section .
Turn 485, G (Grad): OK . OK . S S OK , so one question . This was {disfmarker} in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious , but you can think of the Enter , View and Approach as each having their roles , right ? the {disfmarker} I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching , but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of {disfmarker} they 're sort of like action specific roles and the more general Source - Path - Goal specific roles . So are we worrying about that or not for now ?
Turn 486, C (Grad): Yes , yes . Since you bring it up now , we will worry about it .
Turn 487, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 488, C (Grad): Tell us more about it .
Turn 489, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 490, C (Grad): What do you {disfmarker} what do you {disfmarker}
Turn 491, G (Grad): What 's that ? Oh I guess it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that I 've always viewed things
Turn 492, C (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 493, E (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 494, G (Grad): and {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} that may or may not be what you guys intended . But if it is , then the top block is sort of like um , you know , you have to list exactly what X - schema or in this action schema , there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching , but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're
Turn 495, E (Grad): So very specific role names are " viewed thing " , " entered thing " {disfmarker}
Turn 496, G (Grad): whatever , you know , that {disfmarker} which are {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} think of enter , view and approach as frames
Turn 497, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 498, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 499, G (Grad): and they have frame - specific parameters and {disfmarker} and roles
Turn 500, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 501, G (Grad): and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema and maybe there 's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know , how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics
Turn 502, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , Mm - hmm , Mm - hmm .
Turn 503, G (Grad): or how do they work in f terms of other things . So all of those have um basically f either specific {disfmarker} frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding . So the question is are um {disfmarker} how to represent when things are linked in a certain way . So we know for Enter that there 's Container potentially involved
Turn 504, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 505, G (Grad): and it 's not {disfmarker} uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema SPG schema it {disfmarker} it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal {disfmarker} uh goal I guess in this case .
Turn 506, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 507, G (Grad): So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things
Turn 508, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 509, G (Grad): and I di don't know if that 's something we need to invent or you know just {disfmarker}
Turn 510, B (Grad): The {disfmarker} wa wasn't there supposed to be a link in the
Turn 511, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 512, B (Grad): I don't know if this answers your question , I was just staring at this while you were talking , sorry .
Turn 513, G (Grad): It 's OK .
Turn 514, B (Grad): Uh a link between the action schema , a field in the s in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use so we could {disfmarker}
Turn 515, C (Grad): Yeah . Um , well that 's {disfmarker} that 's one {disfmarker} one thing is that we can link up , think also that um we can have one or m as many as we want links from {disfmarker} from the schema up to the s action um description of it .
Turn 516, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 517, C (Grad): But the notion I got from Nancy 's idea was that we may f find sort of concepts floating around i in the a action description of the action f " Enter " frame up there that are , e when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the {disfmarker} the S Source - Path - Goal schema ,
Turn 518, G (Grad): Exactly . Right , right .
Turn 519, C (Grad): and do we have means of {disfmarker} of telling it within that a and the answer is absolutely .
Turn 520, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 521, C (Grad): The way {disfmarker} we absolutely have those means that are even part of the M - three - L A API ,
Turn 522, G (Grad): Yeah . Oh great . s Uh - huh .
Turn 523, C (Grad): meaning we can reference . So meaning {disfmarker}
Turn 524, G (Grad): Great . That 's exactly what is necessary .
Turn 525, B (Grad): Yeah . St
Turn 526, C (Grad): And um . This referencing thing however is of temporary nature because sooner or later the W - three - C will be finished with their X - path , uh , um , specification and then it 's going to be even much nicer . Then we have real means of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our elements here
Turn 527, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 528, C (Grad): and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents ,
Turn 529, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 530, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 531, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 532, C (Grad): and {disfmarker} and all in a v very easy e homogenous framework .
Turn 533, G (Grad): So you know {disfmarker} happen to know how {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what " sooner or later " means like in practice ?
Turn 534, C (Grad): That 's but it 's soon .
Turn 535, G (Grad): Or estimated . OK , OK .
Turn 536, C (Grad): So it 's g it 's {disfmarker} the spec is there and it 's gonna part of the M - three - L AP {disfmarker} API filed by the end of this year so that this means we can start using it basically now . But this is a technical detail .
Turn 537, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . So a pointer {disfmarker} a way to really say pointers .
Turn 538, B (Grad): Basically references from the roles in the schema {disfmarker} the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha uh I 'm assuming .
Turn 539, G (Grad): Yeah . OK , yeah .
Turn 540, C (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , I mean personally , I 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have X forms , which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the SPG action up there is Enter , then the goal type can never be a statue .
Turn 541, G (Grad): OK . Uh - huh . Right .
Turn 542, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 543, G (Grad): So you have constraints that are dependent on the c actual s specific filler , uh , of some attribute .
Turn 544, C (Grad): Mm - hmm , yeah . W Yeah e exactly . Um , you know this , of course , does not make sense in light of the Statue of Liberty ,
Turn 545, G (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 546, C (Grad): however {vocalsound} it is uh you know sort of {disfmarker} these sort of things are imaginable .
Turn 547, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 548, G (Grad): Tsk . Yeah .
Turn 549, C (Grad): Yeah ?
Turn 550, F (Grad): S So um , like are you gonna have similar schemas for FM
Turn 551, G (Grad): Or the Gateway Arch in St .
Turn 552, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 553, G (Grad): Louis . So .
Turn 554, F (Grad): like forced motion and caused action and stuff like you have for SPG ?
Turn 555, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 556, F (Grad): And if so like can {disfmarker} are you able to enforce that you know if {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's SPG action then you have that schema , if it 's a forced motion then you have the other schema present in the {disfmarker}
Turn 557, C (Grad): Um we have absolute {disfmarker} No . We have absolutely no means of enforcing that , so it would be considered valid if we have an SPG action " Enter " and no SPG schema , but a forced action schema . Could happen .
Turn 558, G (Grad): Whi - which is not bad , because I mean , that there 's multiple sens I mean that particular case , there 's mult there {disfmarker} there 's a forced side of {disfmarker} of that verb as well .
Turn 559, C (Grad): Hmm . It {disfmarker} maybe it means we had nothing to say about the Source - Path - Goal .
Turn 560, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 561, C (Grad): What 's also nice , and for a i for me in my mind it 's {disfmarker} it 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .
Turn 562, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 563, C (Grad): And um we started thinking about going through our bakery questions , so when I say " is there a bakery here ? " you know I do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all f tell the rest of the system " hey this person actually wants to go there " and " B " , {comment} that person actually wants to buy something to eat there . Nuh ? And if these are two different schemas , IE the Source - Path - Goal schema of getting there and then the buying snacks schema , nuh ? {disfmarker}
Turn 564, G (Grad): Would they both be listed here in {disfmarker}
Turn 565, C (Grad): Yes .
Turn 566, G (Grad): OK . Under so o under action schema there 's a list that can include both {disfmarker} both things .
Turn 567, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 568, C (Grad): ye Yeah , they they would {disfmarker} both schemas would appear , so what is the uh is {disfmarker} is there a " buying s snacks " schema ?
Turn 569, E (Grad): Snack action .
Turn 570, G (Grad): That 's interesting .
Turn 571, C (Grad): What is the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} have
Turn 572, G (Grad): What ?
Turn 573, C (Grad): the buying snack schema ?
Turn 574, E (Grad): See .
Turn 575, D (Undergrad): Buying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} buying his food {disfmarker}
Turn 576, E (Grad): I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere .
Turn 577, G (Grad): Oop . I {vocalsound} d f
Turn 578, C (Grad): Yeah , a " commercial event " or something .
Turn 579, G (Grad): Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 580, C (Grad): Yeah ? So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we would {disfmarker} we would instantiate the SPG schema with a Source - Path - Goal blah - blah - blah
Turn 581, G (Grad): I see .
Turn 582, C (Grad): and the buying event you know at which {disfmarker} however that looks like , the place f thing to buy .
Turn 583, G (Grad): Uh - huh . Uh - huh . Interesting . Would you say that the {disfmarker} like {disfmarker} I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , but there 's also this sort of like causal , well , so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of a compound action of some kind , which has structure .
Turn 584, C (Grad): Yeah . Now it 's technically possible that you can fit schema within schema , and schema within schemata {disfmarker}
Turn 585, G (Grad): uh I {disfmarker} I think that 's nicer for a lot of reasons but might be a pain so uh {disfmarker}
Turn 586, C (Grad): um Well , for me it seems that uh {disfmarker} r Yes .
Turn 587, G (Grad): I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once , but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose .
Turn 588, C (Grad): Well , if I 'm {disfmarker} if I 'm recipient of such a message and I get a Source - Path - Goal where the goal is a bakery and then I get a commercial action which takes place in a bakery , right ? and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and they {disfmarker} they are obviously , via identifiers , identified to be the same thing here .
Turn 589, G (Grad): Uh - huh . Yeah . See that {disfmarker} that bothers me that they 're the same thing .
Turn 590, C (Grad): No , no , just the {disfmarker} Yeah ?
Turn 591, G (Grad): Yeah because they 're two different things one of which is l you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second .
Turn 592, C (Grad): Yeah , yeah !
Turn 593, G (Grad): Right . Yeah , yeah . So . So . OK . So there 's like levels of granularity . So uh there 's {disfmarker} there 's um a single event of which they are both a part . And they 're {disfmarker} independently they {disfmarker} they are events which have very different characters as far as Source - Path - Goal whatever .
Turn 594, C (Grad): Mm - hmm , yeah .
Turn 595, G (Grad): So when you identify Source - Path - Goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be a desire , whatever , eating , hunger , whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in {disfmarker} in nice ways . So it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas
Turn 596, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 597, G (Grad): you know from the other {disfmarker} But you know that 's just {disfmarker} That 's just me .
Turn 598, C (Grad): Well , I think we 're gonna hit a lot of interesting problems
Turn 599, G (Grad): Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 600, C (Grad): and as I prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing {vocalsound} about it
Turn 601, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . Between you guys
Turn 602, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 603, G (Grad): uh
Turn 604, C (Grad): and um {disfmarker} and so {disfmarker}
Turn 605, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 606, E (Grad): Yeah I mean I {disfmarker} I still am not entirely sure that I really fully grasp the syntax of this .
Turn 607, B (Grad): Well it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not actually a very {disfmarker} actually , it doesn't actually {disfmarker}
Turn 608, C (Grad): Um it occur {disfmarker} it occurs to me that I mean ne
Turn 609, E (Grad): You know , like what {disfmarker} Right . Or the intended interpretation of this .
Turn 610, C (Grad): um well I should have {disfmarker} we should have added an ano an XML example ,
Turn 611, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 612, C (Grad): or some XML examples
Turn 613, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 614, G (Grad): yeah that would be {disfmarker} that would be nice .
Turn 615, C (Grad): and {disfmarker} and this is on {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on my list of things until next {disfmarker} next week .
Turn 616, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 617, C (Grad): It 's also a question of the recursiveness and {disfmarker} and a hier hierarchy um in there .
Turn 618, G (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 619, C (Grad): Do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump ? I mean it 's {disfmarker} if we can actually you know get it so that we can , out of one utterance , activate more than one schema , I mean , then we 're already pretty good ,
Turn 620, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 621, C (Grad): right ?
Turn 622, A (PhD): Well {disfmarker} well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing because uh {vocalsound} I mean many actions presuppose some {disfmarker} um almost {vocalsound} infinitely many other actions . So if you go to a bakery {pause} you have a general intention of uh not being hungry .
Turn 623, G (Grad): Yeah . Mayb - yeah .
Turn 624, A (PhD): You have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there .
Turn 625, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 626, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 627, A (PhD): You have a further specific intentions to left {disfmarker} to lift your right foot
Turn 628, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 629, A (PhD): and so uh uh I mean y you really have to focus on on {disfmarker} on
Turn 630, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 631, A (PhD): and decide the level of {disfmarker} of abstraction that {disfmarker} that you aim at it kind of zero in on that ,
Turn 632, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 633, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 634, A (PhD): and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that {disfmarker} that you want to constant draw from {disfmarker} from sub - tasks um that are relevant uh I mean but very difficult .
Turn 635, G (Grad): M Th The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som
Turn 636, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 637, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 638, G (Grad): you know so you {disfmarker} like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right .
Turn 639, B (Grad): Well the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the utterance was " is there a bakery around here ? " ,
Turn 640, G (Grad): But having them separate {disfmarker}
Turn 641, B (Grad): not " I want to go to a bakery . "
Turn 642, G (Grad): Well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area .
Turn 643, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 644, G (Grad): And I 'm , yeah {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely ,
Turn 645, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 646, B (Grad): Sure it {disfmarker} OK . Yeah .
Turn 647, G (Grad): but yeah I mean like {disfmarker} but it 's still the case that um you could {disfmarker} you could override that default by giving extra information
Turn 648, C (Grad): Mm - hmm , yeah .
Turn 649, G (Grad): which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of " OK they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here " ,
Turn 650, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 651, G (Grad): which is direct .
Turn 652, C (Grad): Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there should never be a hard coded uh {vocalsound} shortcut from {pause} the bakery question to the uh double schema thing ,
Turn 653, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 654, C (Grad): how uh {disfmarker} And , as a matter of fact , when I have traveled with my friends we make these {disfmarker} exactly these kinds of appointments .
Turn 655, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 656, C (Grad): We o o
Turn 657, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 658, G (Grad): Yeah . Exactly . It 's {disfmarker} I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know {vocalsound} train station London before ,
Turn 659, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 660, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yep .
Turn 661, A (PhD): Well . I have a question about the slot of the SPG action .
Turn 662, G (Grad): yeah . It 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 663, A (PhD): So {vocalsound} the Enter - View - Approach the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the EVA um , those are fixed slots in this particular action . Every action of this kind will have a choice . Or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or will it just um uh {disfmarker} is it change {disfmarker}
Turn 664, E (Grad): Every SPG {disfmarker} every SPG action either is an Enter or a View or an Approach ,
Turn 665, A (PhD): Right , right .
Turn 666, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 667, E (Grad): right ?
Turn 668, A (PhD): So {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I mean for {disfmarker} for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about .
Turn 669, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 670, A (PhD): It can be either A , B or C . Um . So is it a fixed number or {disfmarker} or do you leave it open {disfmarker} it could be between one and fifteen uh {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's flexible .
Turn 671, C (Grad): Um , the uh {disfmarker} Well , it sort of depends on {disfmarker} on if you actually write down the {disfmarker} the schema then you have to say it 's either one of them or it can be none , or it can be any of them . However the uh {disfmarker} it seems to be sensible to me to r to view them as mutually exclusive um maybe even not .
Turn 672, G (Grad): J Do you mean within the Source - Path - Goal actions ?
Turn 673, A (PhD): uh {vocalsound} ye uh uh b I uh I {disfmarker} u I understand
Turn 674, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 675, G (Grad): Those three ?
Turn 676, A (PhD): uh but {disfmarker}
Turn 677, C (Grad): And um how {disfmarker} how where is the end ? So that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 678, A (PhD): No , no . There {disfmarker} a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that , um {vocalsound} is {disfmarker} OK , so you have an SPG action and {disfmarker} and it has three different um uh aspects um because you can either enter a building or view it or {disfmarker} or approach it and touch it or something . Um now you define uh another action , it 's {disfmarker} it 's called um uh s S P G - one
Turn 679, C (Grad): Forced action or forced motion . Yeah .
Turn 680, A (PhD): action  a different action . Um and this {disfmarker} uh action - two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do . And {disfmarker} i in {disfmarker} in a way similar to either Enter - View - Approach you may want to send a letter , read a letter , or dictate a letter , let 's say . So , h
Turn 681, B (Grad): Oh the {disfmarker} OK uh maybe I 'd {disfmarker} The uh {disfmarker} These actions {disfmarker} I don't know if I 'm gonna answer your question or not with this , but the categories inside of action schemas , so , SPG action is a category . Real although I think what we 're specifying here is this is a category where the actions " enter , view and approach " would fall into because they have a related Source - Path - Goal schema in our tourist domain . Cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and {disfmarker} or actually going from one place to another to take a picture , in this {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker}
Turn 682, A (PhD): Right . Oh , s so it 's sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that {disfmarker} that is built elsewhere .
Turn 683, B (Grad): derived I don't know if I u
Turn 684, E (Grad): This is a cate this a category structure here ,
Turn 685, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 686, E (Grad): right ? Action schema . What are some types of action schemas ? Well one of the types of action schemas is Source - Path - Goal action . And what are some types of that ? And an Enter , a View , an Approach .
Turn 687, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 688, C (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 689, E (Grad): Those are all Source - Path - Goal actions .
Turn 690, B (Grad): Inside of Enter there will be roles that can be filled basically . So if I want to go from outside to inside {vocalsound} then you 'd have the roles that need to filled , where you 'd have a Source - Path - Goal set of roles . So you 'd the Source would be outside and Path is to the door or whatever , right ?
Turn 691, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 692, B (Grad): So if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category . Then this category would {disfmarker} we would put it {disfmarker} or not necessarily {disfmarker} We would put a new action in the m uh in the categories that {disfmarker} in which it has the um {disfmarker} Well , every action has a set of related schemas like Source - Path - Goal or force , whatever , right ?
Turn 693, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 694, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 695, B (Grad): So we would put " write a letter " in the categories uh that {disfmarker} in which it had {disfmarker} it w had uh schemas u
Turn 696, E (Grad): There could be a communication event action or something like that
Turn 697, B (Grad): Exactly .
Turn 698, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 699, B (Grad): Schemas uh that of that type .
Turn 700, E (Grad): and you could write it .
Turn 701, B (Grad): And then later , you know , there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} we have a communication event action where we 'd define it down there as {disfmarker}
Turn 702, G (Grad): Hmm . So there 's a bit a redundancy , right ? in {disfmarker} in which the things that go into a particular {disfmarker} You have categories at the top under action schema and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type . So I guess what 's the function of having it up there too ? I mean I guess I 'm wondering whether {disfmarker} You could just have under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it 's gonna be Enter , View or Approach or whatever number of things
Turn 703, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 704, G (Grad): and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories . And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy
Turn 705, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 706, G (Grad): um but if it has {disfmarker} if it 's supposed to be categorized in category X then the corresponding schema X will be among the structures that {disfmarker} that follow .
Turn 707, B (Grad): Right . Well , this is one of things we were arguing about .
Turn 708, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 709, G (Grad): That 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 710, C (Grad): th this is {disfmarker} this r
Turn 711, G (Grad): OK , sorry .
Turn 712, C (Grad): this is {disfmarker} this is more {disfmarker} this is probably the way that th that 's the way that seemed more intuitive to Johno I guess
Turn 713, G (Grad): You didn't tell me to {disfmarker}
Turn 714, C (Grad): also for a while {disfmarker} for
Turn 715, G (Grad): Uh - huh . But now you guys have seen the light .
Turn 716, C (Grad): No , no , no . Uh we have not {disfmarker} we have not seen the light .
Turn 717, B (Grad): No .
Turn 718, G (Grad): So .
Turn 719, B (Grad): The {disfmarker} the reason {disfmarker} One reason we 're doing it this way is in case there 's extra structure that 's in the Enter action that 's not captured by the schemas ,
Turn 720, G (Grad): I it 's easy to go back and forth isn't it ? Uh - huh . I agree . Right . Right .
Turn 721, B (Grad): right ?
Turn 722, G (Grad): Which is why I would think you would say Enter and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to Enter . And then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well . And that 's why the bindings become useful .
Turn 723, B (Grad): Right , but {disfmarker}
Turn 724, E (Grad): Ri - You 'd like {disfmarker} so you 're saying you could practically turn this structure inside out ? or something , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 725, G (Grad): Um Ye - I see what you mean by that ,
Turn 726, C (Grad): No basically w
Turn 727, G (Grad): but I {disfmarker} I don't if I would {disfmarker} I would need to have t have that .
Turn 728, C (Grad): Get {disfmarker} get rid of the sort of SPG slash something uh or the sub - actions category ,
Turn 729, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 730, C (Grad): because what does that tell us ?
Turn 731, G (Grad): Uh - huh . Yeah .
Turn 732, C (Grad): Um and I agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,
Turn 733, G (Grad): I in fact what you could say is for Enter ,
Turn 734, C (Grad): yeah .
Turn 735, G (Grad): you could say " here , list all the kinds of schemas that {disfmarker} on the category that {disfmarker}
Turn 736, E (Grad): List all the parent categories .
Turn 737, G (Grad): you know i list all the parent categories " . It 's just like a frame hierarchy ,
Turn 738, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 739, G (Grad): right ?
Turn 740, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 741, G (Grad): like you have these blended frames . So you would say enter and you 'd say my parent frames are such - and - such , h and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your specific roles which will probably be f richer and fuller and have other stuff in there .
Turn 742, E (Grad): Yeah . This sounds like a paper I 've read around here recently in terms of {disfmarker}
Turn 743, G (Grad): Yeah it could {vocalsound} be not a coincidence . Like I said , I 'm sure I 'm just hitting everything with a hammer that I developed ,
Turn 744, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 745, G (Grad): but I mean you know uh it 's {disfmarker} I 'm just telling you what I think , you just hit the button and it 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 746, C (Grad): And , I guess fr uh
Turn 747, E (Grad): Yeah I mean but there 's a good question here . Like , I mean uh do you {disfmarker} When do you need {disfmarker} Damn this headset ! When you this uh , eh {disfmarker}
Turn 748, G (Grad): Metacomment .
Turn 749, E (Grad): Yeah . {comment} That 's all recorded . Um . Why do you {disfmarker}
Turn 750, G (Grad): " Damn this project . " No just kidding .
Turn 751, E (Grad): I don't know . Like {disfmarker} How do I {disfmarker} how do I come at this question ? Um . I just don't see why you would {disfmarker} I mean does th Who uses this uh {disfmarker} this data structure ? You know ? Like , do you say " alright I 'm going to uh {disfmarker} {pause} do an SPG action " . And then you know somebody ne either the computer or the user says " alright , well , I know I want to do a Source - Path - Goal action so what are my choices among that ? " And " oh , OK , so I can do an Enter - View - Approach " . It 's not like that , right ? It 's more like you say " I want to , uh {disfmarker} {pause} I want to do an Enter . "
Turn 752, B (Grad): Well only one of {disfmarker}
Turn 753, E (Grad): And then you 're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that . Right ? So that the um {disfmarker} the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do ?
Turn 754, B (Grad): I 'd {disfmarker} I
Turn 755, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 756, B (Grad): I think I 'd {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if I understand your question . Only one of those things are gonna be lit up when we pass this on . So only Enter will be {disfmarker}
Turn 757, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 758, B (Grad): if we {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our module decided that Enter is the case , View and Approach will not be there .
Turn 759, E (Grad): OK . OK .
Turn 760, C (Grad): Well {vocalsound} uh it 's {disfmarker} it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on , and would be interesting .
Turn 761, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 762, C (Grad): um nevertheless um
Turn 763, E (Grad): Mayb - Well maybe I 'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to .
Turn 764, B (Grad): Well in that case , we can't {disfmarker} we can't w if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Turn 765, C (Grad): l let 's {disfmarker} let 's not {disfmarker}
Turn 766, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 767, B (Grad): well the thing is if that 's the case we {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} I don't think our system can handle that currently .
Turn 768, E (Grad): What are we doing with this ?
Turn 769, C (Grad): No , not at all . But {disfmarker} U s {vocalsound} t So {disfmarker}
Turn 770, E (Grad): In principle .
Turn 771, G (Grad): " Approach and then enter . "
Turn 772, C (Grad): the {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} in some sense we {disfmarker} we ex get the task done extremely well
Turn 773, G (Grad): Run like this uh {disfmarker}
Turn 774, C (Grad): because this is exactly the discussion we need {disfmarker} need .
Turn 775, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 776, C (Grad): Period . No more qualifiers than that . So .
Turn 777, G (Grad): No , this is the useful ,
Turn 778, C (Grad): and um and {disfmarker} and I th I hope
Turn 779, G (Grad): you know , don don't worry .
Turn 780, C (Grad): um uh let 's make a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sharper claim . We will not end this discussion anytime soon .
Turn 781, G (Grad): Yeah , I can guarantee that .
Turn 782, C (Grad): And it 's gonna get more and more complex the {disfmarker} the l complexer and larger our domains get .
Turn 783, E (Grad): Sigh .
Turn 784, C (Grad): And I think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon . So this is nice about being being recorded also . The um {disfmarker}
Turn 785, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 786, D (Undergrad): That 's true .
Turn 787, B (Grad): The r uh the {disfmarker} in terms of why is {disfmarker} it 's laid out like this versus some other {disfmarker}
Turn 788, C (Grad): the people {disfmarker}
Turn 789, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 790, B (Grad): um that 's kind of a contentious point between the two of us but {vocalsound} this is one wa so this is a way to link uh the way these roles are filled out to the action .
Turn 791, E (Grad): In my view .
Turn 792, B (Grad): Because if we know that Enter is a t is an SPG action ,
Turn 793, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 794, B (Grad): right ?
Turn 795, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 796, B (Grad): we know to look for an SPG schema and put the appropriate {disfmarker} fill in the appropriate roles later on .
Turn 797, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 798, G (Grad): And you could have also indicated that by saying " Enter , what are the kinds of action I am ? "
Turn 799, C (Grad): Mm - hmm , yeah .
Turn 800, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 801, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 802, G (Grad): Right ? So there 's just like sort of reverse organization , right ? So like unless @ @ {disfmarker} Are there reasons why one is better than the other I mean that come from other sources ?
Turn 803, E (Grad): Again {disfmarker}
Turn 804, C (Grad): Yes because nobod no the modules don't {disfmarker}
Turn 805, G (Grad): Yeah . uh
Turn 806, C (Grad): This is {disfmarker} this is a schema that defines XML messages that are passed from one module to another ,
Turn 807, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 808, C (Grad): mainly meaning from the natural language understanding , or from the deep language understanding to the action planner .
Turn 809, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 810, C (Grad): Now the {disfmarker} the reason for {disfmarker} for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back , each module will try {disfmarker} have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents , and then {disfmarker} So you always need the whole body of {disfmarker} of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what . Or you always send it along with it ,
Turn 811, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 812, C (Grad): nuh ? So you always send up " here I am {disfmarker} I am this person , and I can have these parents " in every message .
Turn 813, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 814, C (Grad): which e
Turn 815, G (Grad): OK , so it 's just like a pain to have to send it .
Turn 816, C (Grad): It may or may not be a just a pain it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I 'm completely willing to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to throw all of this away
Turn 817, G (Grad): OK , I understand .
Turn 818, C (Grad): and completely redo it ,
Turn 819, E (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 820, C (Grad): you know and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it after some iterations we may just do that .
Turn 821, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 822, E (Grad): I {disfmarker} I would just like to ask um like , if it could happen for next time , I mean , just beca cuz I 'm new
Turn 823, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 824, E (Grad): and I don't really just {disfmarker} I just don't know what to make of this and what this is for , and stuff like that , you know , so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it ,
Turn 825, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 826, E (Grad): like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this ,
Turn 827, C (Grad): Yeah , we {disfmarker} I will promise for the next time to have fleshed out N {comment} XML examples for a {disfmarker} a run through and {disfmarker} and see how this {disfmarker} this then translates ,
Turn 828, E (Grad): right ? And {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 829, C (Grad): and how this can come about ,
Turn 830, G (Grad): Be great .
Turn 831, C (Grad): nuh ? including the sort of " miracle occurs here " um part .
Turn 832, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 833, C (Grad): And um is there more to be said ? I think um {disfmarker} In principle what I {disfmarker} I think that this approach does , and e e whether or not we take the Enter - View and we all throw up {disfmarker} up the ladder um wha how do how does Professor Peter call that ?
Turn 834, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 835, C (Grad): The uh hhh , {comment} silence su sublimination ? Throwing somebody up the stairs ? Have you never read the Peter 's Principle anyone here ?
Turn 836, E (Grad): Nope .
Turn 837, A (PhD): Oh , uh
Turn 838, F (Grad): People reach their level of uh max their level of {disfmarker} at which they 're incompetent or whatever .
Turn 839, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 840, C (Grad): Maximum incompetence
Turn 841, A (PhD): Yeah . Right , right .
Turn 842, C (Grad): and then you can throw them up the stairs
Turn 843, E (Grad): Alright .
Turn 844, G (Grad): Oh !
Turn 845, C (Grad): um . Yeah .
Turn 846, A (PhD): Promote them , yeah .
Turn 847, C (Grad): OK , so we can promote Enter - View all {disfmarker} all up a bit and and get rid of the uh blah - blah - X - blah uh asterisk sub - action item altogether . No {disfmarker} no problem with that
Turn 848, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 849, C (Grad): and we {disfmarker} w we {disfmarker} we will play around with all of them but the principal distinction between having the {disfmarker} the pure schema and their instantiations on the one hand , and adding some whatever , more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} this approach seems to be uh workable to me . I don't know . If you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier .
Turn 850, B (Grad): This is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions .
Turn 851, G (Grad): Uh yeah wait {disfmarker} R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine .
Turn 852, B (Grad): That 's the {disfmarker} that was the intent of {disfmarker} of it , basically .
Turn 853, E (Grad): Sure . Sure .
Turn 854, G (Grad): Uh that 's true .
Turn 855, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 856, G (Grad): Although um roles {disfmarker}
Turn 857, B (Grad): So I {disfmarker} I do I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker}
Turn 858, C (Grad): I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm never happy when he uses the word " roles " ,
Turn 859, G (Grad): Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 860, C (Grad): I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 861, G (Grad): Yeah . I was going to {disfmarker}
Turn 862, B (Grad): I b I mean ROLLS so
Turn 863, G (Grad): Bread rolls ?
Turn 864, E (Grad): Oh you meant pastries , then ?
Turn 865, B (Grad): Yeah , pastries is what I 'm talking about .
Turn 866, G (Grad): Pastry oh ba oh the bak bakery example .
Turn 867, D (Undergrad): Bakery . Bakery .
Turn 868, E (Grad): This is the bakery example . Got it . Alright .
Turn 869, G (Grad): I see . Right . OK .
Turn 870, E (Grad): Help !
Turn 871, G (Grad): I guess I 'll agree to that , then .
Turn 872, C (Grad): OK . That 's all I have for today . Oh no , there 's one more issue . Bhaskara brought that one up . Meeting time rescheduling .
Turn 873, G (Grad): I n Didn't you say something about Friday ,
Turn 874, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 875, G (Grad): or {disfmarker} ? Hmm .
Turn 876, C (Grad): So it looks like you have not been partaking , the Monday at three o ' clock time has turned out to be not good anymore . So people have been thinking about an alternative time and the one we came up with is Friday two - thirty ? three ? What was it ?
Turn 877, B (Grad): You have class until two , right ? so if we don't want him {disfmarker} if we don't want him to run over here
Turn 878, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 879, C (Grad): Two - th Two - thirty - ish or three or Friday at three or something around that time .
Turn 880, G (Grad): So do I . Yeah .
Turn 881, B (Grad): two thirty - ish or three is {disfmarker}
Turn 882, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 883, F (Grad): Yeah . Yeah . e
Turn 884, C (Grad): Um how {disfmarker} how are your {disfmarker}
Turn 885, G (Grad): That would be good .
Turn 886, A (PhD): uh Friday uh Yeah , that 's fine .
Turn 887, C (Grad): And I know that you have until three {disfmarker} You 're busy ?
Turn 888, E (Grad): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 889, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 890, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 891, G (Grad): So three is {disfmarker} sounds good ?
Turn 892, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 893, G (Grad): I 'll be free by then .
Turn 894, E (Grad): I could do that . Yeah I mean earlier on Friday is better but three {disfmarker} you know I mean {disfmarker} if it were a three or a three thirty time then I would take the three or whatever ,
Turn 895, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 896, E (Grad): but yeah sure three is fine .
Turn 897, C (Grad): Yeah , and you can always make it shortly after three probably .
Turn 898, E (Grad): I mean .
Turn 899, D (Undergrad): Yeah , and I don't need to be here particularly deeply .
Turn 900, C (Grad): Often , no , but uh ,
Turn 901, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 902, C (Grad): whenever .
Turn 903, D (Undergrad): But yeah .
Turn 904, C (Grad): You are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion gets you anywhere in {disfmarker} in your life then uh you 're free to c
Turn 905, D (Undergrad): It 's fascinating .
Turn 906, G (Grad): " That 's the right answer . "
Turn 907, D (Undergrad): I 'm just glad that I don't have to work it out
Turn 908, C (Grad): 
Turn 909, D (Undergrad): because .
Turn 910, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 911, C (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 912, D (Undergrad): I 'm just glad that don't have to work it out myself , that I 'm not involved at all in the working out of it because .
Turn 913, C (Grad): Uh but you 're a linguist .
Turn 914, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 915, C (Grad): You should {disfmarker}
Turn 916, D (Undergrad): Oh yeah . That 's why I 'm glad that I 'm not involved in working it out .
Turn 917, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 918, A (PhD): So it 's at Friday at three ? there that 's
Turn 919, C (Grad): And um
Turn 920, E (Grad): So already again this week ,
Turn 921, C (Grad): How diligent do we feel ?
Turn 922, E (Grad): huh ?
Turn 923, C (Grad): Yeah . Do feel that we have done our chores for this week or {disfmarker}
Turn 924, F (Grad): Yeah . So I mean clearly there 's {disfmarker} I can talk about the um the parser changes on Friday at least ,
Turn 925, C (Grad): OK , Bhaskara will do the big show on Friday .
Turn 926, F (Grad): so .
Turn 927, G (Grad): And you guys will argue some more ?
Turn 928, B (Grad): And between now and then yeah .
Turn 929, E (Grad): Yeah . Between now and then .
Turn 930, G (Grad): and have some ?
Turn 931, C (Grad): We will {disfmarker} r
Turn 932, E (Grad): Promise ?
Turn 933, G (Grad): probably .
Turn 934, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 935, B (Grad): We will . Don't worry .
Turn 936, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 937, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 938, G (Grad): And we 'll get the summary like , this {disfmarker} the c you know , short version , like {disfmarker}
Turn 939, A (PhD): An - and I would like to second Keith 's request .
Turn 940, G (Grad): S
Turn 941, A (PhD): An example wo would be nice t to have kind of a detailed example .
Turn 942, C (Grad): Yes .
Turn 943, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 944, C (Grad): Yes . I 've {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I guess I 'm on record for promising that now .
Turn 945, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 946, C (Grad): So um {disfmarker}
Turn 947, G (Grad): Like have it {disfmarker} we 'll have it in writing . So . or , better , speech . So .
Turn 948, C (Grad): This is it and um
Turn 949, B (Grad): The other good thing about it is Jerry can be on here on Friday and he can weigh in as well .
Turn 950, C (Grad): Yeah . and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for Johno and me .
Turn 951, G (Grad): Oh yeah uh OK . let 's uh yeah they 're {disfmarker}
Turn 952, C (Grad): Give us {disfmarker}
Turn 953, D (Undergrad): No problem ,
Turn 954, E (Grad): I think you 've got one on hand ,
Turn 955, D (Undergrad): yeah .
Turn 956, E (Grad): huh ?
Turn 957, G (Grad): I have several in my head , yeah . Always thinking about binding .
Turn 958, C (Grad): Well the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the binding is technically no problem but it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s if {disfmarker} if there {disfmarker} if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature , we should distill them out and put them where the schemas are .
Turn 959, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 960, C (Grad): If there are things that you know are intention - specific , then we should put them up somewhere , a
Turn 961, G (Grad): So , in general they 'll be bindings across both intentions and the actions .
Turn 962, C (Grad): Yep . That 's wonderful .
Turn 963, G (Grad): So {disfmarker} Yeah . So it 's gen it 's general across all of these things
Turn 964, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 965, G (Grad): it 's like {disfmarker} I mean Shastri would say you know binding is like {vocalsound} an essential cognitive uh process . So . {vocalsound} Um .
Turn 966, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 967, G (Grad): So I don't think it will be isolated to one or the two , but you can definitely figure out where {disfmarker} Yeah , sometimes things belong and {disfmarker} So actually I 'm not sure {disfmarker} I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . Like I know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that ,
Turn 968, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 969, G (Grad): right ? So is the ri right now are the ideas the rich {disfmarker} rich the RAD or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention . It 's still {disfmarker} it 's still mainly intention hypothesis
Turn 970, C (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 971, G (Grad): and then that 's just one way to describe the {disfmarker} the action part of it .
Turn 972, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 973, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 974, B (Grad): It 's an a attempt to refine it basically .
Turn 975, C (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} And yeah ,
Turn 976, G (Grad): OK , great uh - huh .
Turn 977, C (Grad): it 's an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 978, G (Grad): Not just that you want to go from here to here , it 's that the action is what you intend
Turn 979, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 980, G (Grad): and this action consists of all com complicated modules and image schemas and whatever .
Turn 981, C (Grad): Yeah . And {disfmarker} and there will be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a relatively high level of redundancy
Turn 982, G (Grad): So .
Turn 983, C (Grad): in the sense that um ultimately one {disfmarker}
Turn 984, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . which is , yeah , It 's fine
Turn 985, C (Grad): so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say " well if you really look at it , you just need our RAD . " You can throw the rest away , right ?
Turn 986, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 987, C (Grad): Because you 're not gonna get anymore information out of the action a as you find it there in the domain object .
Turn 988, G (Grad): Right . Right . Mm - hmm .
Turn 989, C (Grad): But then again um in this case , the domain object may contain information that we don't really care about either . So .
Turn 990, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 991, C (Grad): H But w we 'll see that then , and how {disfmarker} how it sort of evolves .
Turn 992, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 993, C (Grad): I mean if {disfmarker} if people really like our {disfmarker} our RAD , I mean w what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely , you know , and leave it up for us to get the parser input um
Turn 994, G (Grad): Mmm . We know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of RAD .
Turn 995, C (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 996, D (Undergrad): You don't have to use the acronym .
Turn 997, G (Grad): I can't believe we 're using this term . So I 'm like RAD ! Like every time I say it , it 's horrible . OK .
Turn 998, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 999, G (Grad): I see what you mean .
Turn 1000, B (Grad): RAD 's a great term .
Turn 1001, G (Grad): Is the {disfmarker} But what is the " why " ?
Turn 1002, E (Grad): It 's rad , even !
Turn 1003, B (Grad): Why ?
Turn 1004, G (Grad): Why ?
Turn 1005, E (Grad): It happened to c be what it stands for .
Turn 1006, B (Grad): It just happened to be the acronym .
Turn 1007, C (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1008, G (Grad): Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} doesn't make it a great term . It 's just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels .
Turn 1009, C (Grad): ye no but i
Turn 1010, D (Undergrad): Just think of it as {disfmarker} as " wheel " in German .
Turn 1011, C (Grad): but if you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you work in th in that XML community it is a great acronym
Turn 1012, G (Grad): Do you see what I mean ? Like
Turn 1013, C (Grad): because it e evokes whatever RDF {disfmarker}
Turn 1014, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1015, C (Grad): RDF is the biggest thing right ? That 's the rich {disfmarker} sort of " Resource Description Framework "
Turn 1016, E (Grad): Oh " rich de "
Turn 1017, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1018, C (Grad): and um {disfmarker} and also {disfmarker} So , description , having the word d term " description " in there is wonderful ,
Turn 1019, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1020, C (Grad): uh " rich " is also great , rwww .
Turn 1021, F (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 1022, B (Grad): Who doesn't like to be a
Turn 1023, E (Grad): Everybody likes action .
Turn 1024, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1025, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1026, G (Grad): Yeah . OK .
Turn 1027, E (Grad): Plus it 's hip . The kids 'll like it .
Turn 1028, G (Grad): But what if it 's not an action ?
Turn 1029, C (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} it 's rad ,
Turn 1030, D (Undergrad): Yeah all the kids 'll love it .
Turn 1031, F (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 1032, C (Grad): yeah .
Turn 1033, G (Grad): And intentions will be " RID " ? Like , " OK " . Um are the {disfmarker} are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago {disfmarker} like the things {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} maybe you 're gonna run a trial tomorrow . I mean , I 'm just wondering whether the ac some the actual sentences from this domain will be available . Cuz it 'd be nice for me to like look if I 'm thinking about examples I 'm mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting . So you showed some in this {disfmarker} here before
Turn 1034, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1035, G (Grad): and maybe you 've posted it before but where would I look if I want to see ?
Turn 1036, C (Grad): Oh I {disfmarker} You want audio ?
Turn 1037, G (Grad): You know .
Turn 1038, C (Grad): or do you want transcript ?
Turn 1039, G (Grad): No just {disfmarker} just transcript .
Turn 1040, C (Grad): Yeah , well just transcript is just not available because nobody has transcribed it yet .
Turn 1041, G (Grad): Sorry .
Turn 1042, C (Grad): Um I can e I can uh I 'll transcribe it though .
Turn 1043, G (Grad): Oh , OK . I take that back then .
Turn 1044, C (Grad): It 's no problem .
Turn 1045, G (Grad): OK , well don't {disfmarker} don't make it a high priority {disfmarker}
Turn 1046, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1047, G (Grad): I {disfmarker} In fact if you just tell me like you know like two examples
Turn 1048, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1049, G (Grad): I mean , y The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the representational problems are {disfmarker} I 'm sure , will be there ,
Turn 1050, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 1051, G (Grad): like enough for me to think about . So .
Turn 1052, C (Grad): OK , so Friday , whoever wants and comes , and can .
Turn 1053, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1054, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 1055, C (Grad): This Friday .
Turn 1056, G (Grad): Here . OK .
Turn 1057, C (Grad): The big parser show . Now you can all turn off your {disfmarker}
