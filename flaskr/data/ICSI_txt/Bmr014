Turn 0, E (Professor): Alright .
Turn 1, C (Grad): So are you {disfmarker}
Turn 2, E (Professor): So .
Turn 3, C (Grad): Are we going ?
Turn 4, E (Professor): It is uh , must be February fifteenth .
Turn 5, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 6, C (Grad): Yu I think the date 's written in there , yep . And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to " Session " , and write MR eleven .
Turn 7, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today .
Turn 8, C (Grad): And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused .
Turn 9, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 10, A (PhD): MR eleven .
Turn 11, C (Grad): MR eleven .
Turn 12, F (Postdoc): That sounds like a spy code .
Turn 13, E (Professor): Mmm . OK . So .
Turn 14, C (Grad): There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly .
Turn 15, E (Professor): Agenda . Any agenda items today ?
Turn 16, C (Grad): I wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up .
Turn 17, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 18, F (Postdoc): I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . In particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask .
Turn 19, E (Professor): OK audio monitoring , Jane .
Turn 20, F (Postdoc): Ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i In listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings ,
Turn 21, C (Grad): Oh really .
Turn 22, F (Postdoc): so I {disfmarker}
Turn 23, B (PhD): " Spikes " , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 24, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 25, A (PhD): Spikes ?
Turn 26, C (Grad): Clicks .
Turn 27, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 28, E (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 29, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 30, B (PhD): Huh .
Turn 31, F (Postdoc): And I don't know what the e electronics is but .
Turn 32, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 33, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 34, C (Grad): Well , I think it 's
Turn 35, A (PhD): Touching .
Turn 36, C (Grad): uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things .
Turn 37, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 38, C (Grad): It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector .
Turn 39, F (Postdoc): Oh , OK . Well maybe {disfmarker} Then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker}
Turn 40, B (PhD): You could try an experiment and say " OK , I 'm about to test for spikes " ,
Turn 41, F (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I take that off the agenda .
Turn 42, B (PhD): and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you .
Turn 43, C (Grad): Yeah . Right .
Turn 44, B (PhD): " Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . "
Turn 45, F (Postdoc): Oh that {disfmarker}
Turn 46, E (Professor): Um .
Turn 47, F (Postdoc): Well , OK .
Turn 48, B (PhD): No I 'm just {disfmarker} 
Turn 49, E (Professor): I mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . And if they are , then they can't be used .
Turn 50, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 51, E (Professor): So . Um . Let 's see . I guess {pause} I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .
Turn 52, F (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 53, E (Professor): And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll start with that actually . Uh , um . {vocalsound} Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} And I think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker}
Turn 54, C (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 55, E (Professor): and {disfmarker} and I 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} So , uh in order {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think that this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 56, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 57, E (Professor): But um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before .
Turn 58, C (Grad): Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items .
Turn 59, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 60, E (Professor): OK . You {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ?
Turn 61, C (Grad): Sure .
Turn 62, E (Professor): OK . Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .
Turn 63, C (Grad): Let me
Turn 64, E (Professor): Uh .
Turn 65, B (PhD): That 'll be {disfmarker} I think that 'll help {disfmarker}
Turn 66, C (Grad): I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done .
Turn 67, B (PhD): That 'll help a lot , actually .
Turn 68, E (Professor): Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} But . Uh . {comment} But we can try . Maybe it 'll work .
Turn 69, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 70, C (Grad): Yeah . Maybe . Weirder things have happened .
Turn 71, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 72, F (Postdoc): I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean . Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .
Turn 73, B (PhD): I would {disfmarker} I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .
Turn 74, C (Grad): Well then {disfmarker}
Turn 75, E (Professor): Yeah . Actually it {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} So we 're done with that topic . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .
Turn 76, C (Grad): Yeah , actually I {disfmarker} I was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too .
Turn 77, E (Professor): Yeah . Why {disfmarker} why don't we do that .
Turn 78, C (Grad): OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . Um . {pause} And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,
Turn 79, A (PhD): 
Turn 80, C (Grad): and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired .
Turn 81, E (Professor): So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?
Turn 82, C (Grad): Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
Turn 83, E (Professor): So , um .
Turn 84, C (Grad): And {disfmarker} So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .
Turn 85, E (Professor): So let 's see we {disfmarker}
Turn 86, C (Grad): Right ? So we could have up to nine .
Turn 87, E (Professor): And right now we can have up to six .
Turn 88, C (Grad): Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more .
Turn 89, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 90, C (Grad): And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel .
Turn 91, E (Professor): Oh . So yeah so the only {disfmarker} Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .
Turn 92, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 93, E (Professor): Oh , we should do it .
Turn 94, C (Grad): OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them .
Turn 95, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 96, B (PhD): I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . If {disfmarker} So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK .
Turn 97, C (Grad): No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working ,
Turn 98, B (PhD): OK . I see .
Turn 99, C (Grad): along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .
Turn 100, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 101, B (PhD): Three wireds work ,
Turn 102, E (Professor): Basically we found {disfmarker}
Turn 103, B (PhD): right ?
Turn 104, C (Grad): I {disfmarker} I guess three wireds work , yeah .
Turn 105, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 106, E (Professor): Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that .
Turn 107, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 108, E (Professor): And that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole Jimbox thing and all that .
Turn 109, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 110, E (Professor): And so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .
Turn 111, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 112, E (Professor): That seems to be the key issue .
Turn 113, C (Grad): Everyone 's battery OK ?
Turn 114, B (PhD): I checked them this morning , they should be .
Turn 115, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 116, E (Professor): Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} That 's the only thing with them . But the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} Um I heard from UW that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .
Turn 117, C (Grad): Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that .
Turn 118, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 119, B (PhD): SRI , really ?
Turn 120, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 121, B (PhD): Oh .
Turn 122, C (Grad): They got sa apparent Well , Maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue .
Turn 123, E (Professor): Uh , I don't know .
Turn 124, C (Grad): I don't know how much of it 's public .
Turn 125, E (Professor): Probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .
Turn 126, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 127, E (Professor): Yeah . But anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and NIST and UW . So . Um . But {disfmarker} but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the Sony ,
Turn 128, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 129, E (Professor): uh , radio - mikes . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?
Turn 130, C (Grad): Uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it .
Turn 131, E (Professor): No ?
Turn 132, C (Grad): So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it .
Turn 133, E (Professor): Oh .
Turn 134, C (Grad): So , they {disfmarker} they charge
Turn 135, E (Professor): OK . Nothing against you and your hand - soldering
Turn 136, C (Grad): right .
Turn 137, E (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 138, C (Grad): You 've never seen my hand - soldering . But uh , a as I said they 're coming in .
Turn 139, E (Professor): Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker}
Turn 140, C (Grad): I {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 141, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 142, C (Grad): Yeah . I mean .
Turn 143, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 144, C (Grad): As professionally as I guess you can get it done .
Turn 145, E (Professor): Well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 146, C (Grad): I mean i it 's just their repair shop . Right ? Their maintenance people .
Turn 147, E (Professor): Well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like .
Turn 148, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 149, E (Professor): That {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . Th - this {disfmarker} Yeah , OK . Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that .
Turn 150, C (Grad): And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like .
Turn 151, E (Professor): Uh , Yeah . So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess {disfmarker} Was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ?
Turn 152, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah . Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that .
Turn 153, C (Grad): Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the {disfmarker} all that last week . So all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those .
Turn 154, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . So he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that .
Turn 155, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 156, C (Grad): I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll take too long .
Turn 157, E (Professor): So anyway {disfmarker}
Turn 158, C (Grad): So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .
Turn 159, E (Professor): So anyway I think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .
Turn 160, C (Grad): Right . I 've already done five or six {pause} sets .
Turn 161, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 162, C (Grad): So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .
Turn 163, E (Professor): Yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} Right . OK . Uh , is Dave {disfmarker} I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows .
Turn 164, F (Postdoc): I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .
Turn 165, A (PhD): No , no .
Turn 166, C (Grad): Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list .
Turn 167, F (Postdoc): Yeah . Should we call him ? I mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ?
Turn 168, E (Professor): I don't know .
Turn 169, F (Postdoc): Should I call his office and see ?
Turn 170, A (PhD): He was in .
Turn 171, C (Grad): I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts .
Turn 172, E (Professor): Uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker}
Turn 173, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 174, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 175, A (PhD): Yeah , he was in {pause} s
Turn 176, F (Postdoc): He wasn't there at cof
Turn 177, E (Professor): Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him .
Turn 178, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 179, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 180, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 181, E (Professor): OK . Uh , so .
Turn 182, C (Grad): Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} Tuesdays and Thursdays ?
Turn 183, A (PhD): I think he has a class . Yeah .
Turn 184, B (PhD): Yeah . He might have .
Turn 185, C (Grad): Oh well , whatever .
Turn 186, D (Grad): You talking about David Gelbart ?
Turn 187, E (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 188, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 189, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 190, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 191, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 192, F (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 193, D (Grad): Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now .
Turn 194, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 195, D (Grad): So .
Turn 196, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 197, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 198, E (Professor): OK . So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . OK . Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on .
Turn 199, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 200, E (Professor): And the {disfmarker} and the recordings also ,
Turn 201, F (Postdoc): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 202, E (Professor): just where we are . Yeah .
Turn 203, F (Postdoc): Well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 204, C (Grad): Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .
Turn 205, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} How much of that is digits ? It 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits ,
Turn 206, C (Grad): That 's including digits .
Turn 207, E (Professor): right ?
Turn 208, C (Grad): I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .
Turn 209, E (Professor): So {disfmarker} Yeah . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} There 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker}
Turn 210, A (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 211, C (Grad): Of {disfmarker} of non - digits ?
Turn 212, E (Professor): i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} Of non - digits .
Turn 213, C (Grad): Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time .
Turn 214, E (Professor): Yeah , yeah . OK .
Turn 215, F (Postdoc): OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to {disfmarker} that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " . And you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker}
Turn 216, C (Grad): Nine two ,
Turn 217, F (Postdoc): e Exactly .
Turn 218, C (Grad): right .
Turn 219, F (Postdoc): So if you just say " nine two " , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things .
Turn 220, B (PhD): You know , Jane ?
Turn 221, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 222, B (PhD): Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in {disfmarker} in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , {comment} a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of {pause} inconsistencies and mis
Turn 223, C (Grad): Misspelled .
Turn 224, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 225, F (Postdoc): You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh {pause} on each {disfmarker} on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the {disfmarker} from the corpus .
Turn 226, B (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 227, F (Postdoc): Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I {disfmarker} I agree that 's a very good use of it .
Turn 228, B (PhD): Oh so you already have that , OK .
Turn 229, F (Postdoc): Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a way {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} You know , the spell - check basically does that but {disfmarker} but in addition {disfmarker} yes , that 's {disfmarker} that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .
Turn 230, B (PhD): Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh ,
Turn 231, F (Postdoc): Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s
Turn 232, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 233, B (PhD): i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and {disfmarker} and so it makes it easier .
Turn 234, F (Postdoc): Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good {disfmarker} that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was {disfmarker} that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but {disfmarker} So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a {disfmarker} he she wants the uh , actually a {disfmarker} an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either " VOC " for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , " NONVOC " for door - slam , and " GLOSS " for things that have to do with {disfmarker} if they said a s a spoken form with this {disfmarker} m this pronunciation error .
Turn 235, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 236, F (Postdoc): I already had that convention
Turn 237, B (PhD): Oh that 's great .
Turn 238, F (Postdoc): but I {disfmarker} I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most {disfmarker} ha most efficiently handled by uh {disfmarker} by a {disfmarker} a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list {disfmarker} exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say " curly bracket laugh curly bracket " ,
Turn 239, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 240, F (Postdoc): then y you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,
Turn 241, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 242, F (Postdoc): so man So many ways that error prone .
Turn 243, B (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 244, F (Postdoc): So , um , {vocalsound} um I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying ,
Turn 245, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 246, F (Postdoc): you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens
Turn 247, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 248, F (Postdoc): and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus
Turn 249, C (Grad): You don't know what they could be .
Turn 250, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 251, F (Postdoc): Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um {pause} and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or have variant {disfmarker} u u uses like the numbers you can say " nine two " or you can say " ninety - two " ,
Turn 252, C (Grad): So how are you doing the {disfmarker}
Turn 253, F (Postdoc): and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually .
Turn 254, C (Grad): How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ?
Turn 255, F (Postdoc): It would be separate {disfmarker} The letters would be separated in space
Turn 256, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 257, F (Postdoc): and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,
Turn 258, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 259, F (Postdoc): so gloss of {pause} whatever .
Turn 260, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 261, F (Postdoc): I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh {vocalsound} the you know , {comment} uh enumerated , or i
Turn 262, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 263, F (Postdoc): it 's not a good way of saying {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {vocalsound} specific uh way of stating these {disfmarker} these letters .
Turn 264, C (Grad): Right . So it sounds good .
Turn 265, F (Postdoc): And so anyway , the clean {disfmarker} those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . But that 's been my top priority {disfmarker} beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .
Turn 266, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 267, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 268, F (Postdoc): And uh , Thilo had a {disfmarker} e e a breakthrough with this {disfmarker} this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority {disfmarker} get the data clean , and channelized .
Turn 269, A (PhD): I actually gave
Turn 270, C (Grad): Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?
Turn 271, F (Postdoc): Oh yes .
Turn 272, C (Grad): Okay , good .
Turn 273, F (Postdoc): Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,
Turn 274, C (Grad): Oh good . Good .
Turn 275, F (Postdoc): and I went through it last night , it 's {disfmarker} it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I {disfmarker} I left them discretion at commas .
Turn 276, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 277, F (Postdoc): Uh {disfmarker} and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .
Turn 278, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 279, F (Postdoc): And um , and {disfmarker} so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in {disfmarker} in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can {disfmarker} where I can show that . And {disfmarker} and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " .
Turn 280, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 281, F (Postdoc): And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .
Turn 282, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 283, B (PhD): When {disfmarker} for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ?
Turn 284, F (Postdoc): It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses .
Turn 285, B (PhD): Oh .
Turn 286, F (Postdoc): So they tried to approximate it , but it was {disfmarker}
Turn 287, B (PhD): Oh good .
Turn 288, F (Postdoc): it was spelled GABBL {disfmarker}
Turn 289, B (PhD): Sort of how it sounds . Yeah .
Turn 290, F (Postdoc): Yes . More of an attempt to {disfmarker} I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these {disfmarker} the a this {disfmarker} this was a sound {disfmarker} these are the sounds ,
Turn 291, C (Grad): It was a technical term that she didn't recognize ,
Turn 292, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 293, F (Postdoc): but {disfmarker} Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she {disfmarker} even though her technical perception is just really {disfmarker} uh you know I 've {disfmarker} I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses
Turn 294, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 295, F (Postdoc): then cuz " neural nets " and {disfmarker} oh she has some things that are {disfmarker} oh " downsampled " , she got that right .
Turn 296, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 297, F (Postdoc): And some of these are rather {pause} uh unexpected .
Turn 298, C (Grad): Obscure , yeah .
Turn 299, F (Postdoc): But ch ten solid uh {disfmarker} m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .
Turn 300, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ?
Turn 301, F (Postdoc): And um {disfmarker}
Turn 302, E (Professor): Is that right ?
Turn 303, F (Postdoc): Yes exactly .
Turn 304, E (Professor): Yeah , OK .
Turn 305, F (Postdoc): And that 's part of this {disfmarker} Eleven hours .
Turn 306, E (Professor): Is that {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} that including digits ? Yeah .
Turn 307, F (Postdoc): Yes it is .
Turn 308, E (Professor): So let 's say roughly {pause} ten hours or so of {disfmarker}
Turn 309, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 310, E (Professor): I mean it 's probably more than that but {disfmarker} but with {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits .
Turn 311, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 312, F (Postdoc): It 'd be more than that because I {disfmarker} my recollection is the minutes {disfmarker} that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person .
Turn 313, E (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 314, F (Postdoc): But um {pause} the {disfmarker} the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,
Turn 315, E (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 316, F (Postdoc): But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .
Turn 317, E (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 318, F (Postdoc): So they 're still working {disfmarker} some of them are {disfmarker} Two of them are still working on completing that . Yeah .
Turn 319, B (PhD): Boy , they 're moving right along .
Turn 320, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 321, F (Postdoc): Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .
Turn 322, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 323, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 324, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 325, E (Professor): So what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what 's the deal with {disfmarker} with your {disfmarker}
Turn 326, A (PhD): The channel u thing ?
Turn 327, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 328, A (PhD): Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} {comment} speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in uh {disfmarker} in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one {disfmarker} one meeting to {disfmarker} to Liz who wanted to {disfmarker} to try it for {disfmarker} for the recognizer
Turn 329, E (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 330, A (PhD): as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever ,
Turn 331, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 332, A (PhD): and so {pause} she {disfmarker} she will try that I think
Turn 333, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 334, A (PhD): and {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm working on it . So , I hope {disfmarker}
Turn 335, C (Grad): Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ?
Turn 336, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 337, A (PhD): No . Uh , I {pause} mmm , use some {disfmarker} some different features but not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker}
Turn 338, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 339, A (PhD): The basic thing is this HMM base .
Turn 340, C (Grad): So there 's still no {disfmarker} no knowledge using different channels at the same time .
Turn 341, A (PhD): There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels
Turn 342, C (Grad): You know what I mean ? Across all of them .
Turn 343, A (PhD): yeah .
Turn 344, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 345, A (PhD): So . But basically that 's one of the main changes .
Turn 346, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 347, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something .
Turn 348, A (PhD): Oh I just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things now as they {disfmarker} before there were {disfmarker} they were some in {disfmarker} in the log domain and I {disfmarker} I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker}
Turn 349, E (Professor): Cu - Cube root ?
Turn 350, A (PhD): Yeah . To {disfmarker} No , I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} to the loudness thingy with the {disfmarker} with the
Turn 351, C (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 352, E (Professor): Ah .
Turn 353, A (PhD): how do you call it ? I 'm not sure . With the , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 354, E (Professor): Fletcher Munson ? No .
Turn 355, A (PhD): I 'm not sure about the term .
Turn 356, E (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 357, A (PhD): Uh , I 'll look it up . And say it to you .
Turn 358, E (Professor): Yeah , alright .
Turn 359, A (PhD): Uh , OK , and {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} that 's basically the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing . Yeah , and I {disfmarker} and I tried t to normalize uh {disfmarker} uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel ,
Turn 360, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 361, A (PhD): because they 're , {vocalsound} yeah to {disfmarker} to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . And it works quite well . But , not always .
Turn 362, E (Professor): Uh - huh . Uh - huh .
Turn 363, A (PhD): So .
Turn 364, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 365, C (Grad): Good .
Turn 366, E (Professor): Um , let 's see . I think the uh {disfmarker} Were {disfmarker} were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh {disfmarker} bleep editing .
Turn 367, C (Grad): Right . So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker} We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece {disfmarker} pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,
Turn 368, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 369, C (Grad): a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password .
Turn 370, E (Professor): I {disfmarker} I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then {pause} um {pause} if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " .
Turn 371, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 372, E (Professor): And , I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .
Turn 373, C (Grad): Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for {pause} other reasons .
Turn 374, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 375, C (Grad): And so that {disfmarker} that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people {disfmarker} you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um {pause} I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , " here 's the web page " , um , " you need a password " . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .
Turn 376, E (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say {vocalsound} " here is a {disfmarker} here is {disfmarker} " I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but {disfmarker} but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " .
Turn 377, C (Grad): I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .
Turn 378, E (Professor): And then they 'd hand it back to you .
Turn 379, C (Grad): But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . These are big , and I would much rather be {pause} ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .
Turn 380, E (Professor): You find it easier to go through a large {disfmarker} I mean how do you read books ?
Turn 381, C (Grad): Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web .
Turn 382, E (Professor): Really ? I mean , it {disfmarker}
Turn 383, C (Grad): Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to {disfmarker} go to the web site {comment} and visit it as I want .
Turn 384, E (Professor): Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds {disfmarker} a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web .
Turn 385, C (Grad): Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So .
Turn 386, E (Professor): Really ?
Turn 387, F (Postdoc): I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I {disfmarker} I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the {disfmarker}
Turn 388, E (Professor): So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong ,
Turn 389, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 390, E (Professor): but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the {disfmarker} where 's the release ? " And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? {disfmarker} OK there 's {disfmarker} I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .
Turn 391, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 392, E (Professor): OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . " And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not {disfmarker} so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,
Turn 393, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 394, E (Professor): but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . Um if {disfmarker} if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . I mean , so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I mean , you {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where {disfmarker} where I {disfmarker} I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , " and then that group would need it {disfmarker} S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy ,
Turn 395, C (Grad): Well , no fre for the most {disfmarker}
Turn 396, E (Professor): we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people
Turn 397, C (Grad): For the most frequent case they just say {pause} " it 's OK " and then they 're done . And I think {pause} almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .
Turn 398, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 399, F (Postdoc): The other thing too is it seems like {disfmarker}
Turn 400, E (Professor): Um , yeah , that 's true .
Turn 401, F (Postdoc): Go ahead .
Turn 402, C (Grad): I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .
Turn 403, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 404, E (Professor): I guess {disfmarker} Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright .
Turn 405, C (Grad): Oh that was another thing I {disfmarker} I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it {disfmarker} that an email approval was sufficient . But {pause} I don't actually know .
Turn 406, B (PhD): Are {disfmarker} are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?
Turn 407, C (Grad): Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think they should be allowed to do that .
Turn 408, F (Postdoc): I also {disfmarker} mm - hmm .
Turn 409, B (PhD): So that means other people are editing what you say ?
Turn 410, E (Professor): Uh {pause} I don't know about that .
Turn 411, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 412, B (PhD): I don't know if I like that .
Turn 413, C (Grad): Well , the only other choice is that the person would say " no , don't distribute this meeting at all " , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say " don't distribute it at all " .
Turn 414, E (Professor): But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .
Turn 415, C (Grad): Well , but if {disfmarker} if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .
Turn 416, E (Professor): Right ? Yeah . Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ?
Turn 417, C (Grad): Um , I don't think so . I mean , because if I object to the conversation .
Turn 418, E (Professor): I think it is .
Turn 419, C (Grad): If I say " we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , " and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side .
Turn 420, F (Postdoc): The {disfmarker} I agree that the consent forms were {disfmarker} uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that {vocalsound} um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .
Turn 421, E (Professor): I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said .
Turn 422, F (Postdoc): And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that {vocalsound} uh , we wouldn't want someone to say " oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but {vocalsound} it was too hard to access " . So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now {disfmarker} in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's {disfmarker} i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But {disfmarker} but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK .
Turn 423, C (Grad): I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . Um .
Turn 424, E (Professor): Um {pause} I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not .
Turn 425, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 426, E (Professor): Others would consider it {disfmarker} this uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a set of skills that they would have to gain . You know ?
Turn 427, C (Grad): Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .
Turn 428, E (Professor): It depends on what meetings .
Turn 429, F (Postdoc): That 's true .
Turn 430, B (PhD): So far .
Turn 431, C (Grad): So .
Turn 432, E (Professor): In the meetings so far , yeah .
Turn 433, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 434, E (Professor): But we 're trying to expand this , right ?
Turn 435, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 436, E (Professor): So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I actually think that paper is the more universal thing .
Turn 437, C (Grad): And that {disfmarker} Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright .
Turn 438, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 439, C (Grad): I think everyone in the meeting can access the web .
Turn 440, E (Professor): No , I think we have to be able to print it out . It 's not just if they want to print it out . I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Turn 441, C (Grad): OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ?
Turn 442, F (Postdoc): Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking .
Turn 443, E (Professor): I {disfmarker} I th
Turn 444, C (Grad): Well , I don't think I {disfmarker}
Turn 445, E (Professor): well {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} there was this {disfmarker}
Turn 446, C (Grad): well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues .
Turn 447, E (Professor): No .
Turn 448, F (Postdoc): Good . For security ?
Turn 449, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 450, F (Postdoc): Yeah , OK good .
Turn 451, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 452, C (Grad): Um . So giving them , you think a web site to say , " if you wanna print it out here it is " , is not sufficient ?
Turn 453, F (Postdoc): Good point . 
Turn 454, A (PhD): Yeah . I
Turn 455, E (Professor): Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient .
Turn 456, C (Grad): Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what {disfmarker} the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .
Turn 457, E (Professor): I 'm just wondering about {disfmarker}
Turn 458, F (Postdoc): You could mail it to them .
Turn 459, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 460, F (Postdoc): Get an a mailing address .
Turn 461, C (Grad): Equivalent .
Turn 462, A (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 463, F (Postdoc): But I think it 's easier to drop in the box .
Turn 464, A (PhD): Just put the button on {disfmarker} on the web page which say " please send me the {disfmarker} the scripts " .
Turn 465, C (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 466, F (Postdoc): Oh that 's interesting .
Turn 467, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 468, B (PhD): What um {disfmarker} When you display it on the web page , what are {disfmarker} what are you showing them ? Utterances , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 469, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 470, B (PhD): And so can they bleep within an utterance ?
Turn 471, C (Grad): No . Whole utterances only .
Turn 472, B (PhD): Whole utterances .
Turn 473, C (Grad): And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .
Turn 474, E (Professor): There 's another aspect to this which maybe {disfmarker} is part of why this is bothering me . Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .
Turn 475, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 476, C (Grad): I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient .
Turn 477, E (Professor): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I understand .
Turn 478, B (PhD): I know where you 're going .
Turn 479, E (Professor): I think that 's the bad idea .
Turn 480, C (Grad): Oh .
Turn 481, E (Professor): See because you 're gon you 're {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Really . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it {disfmarker} There was a {disfmarker} one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . Nobody 's being l libeled . You know , this is {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're covering {disfmarker} We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I {disfmarker} I 'm trying to {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}
Turn 482, C (Grad): I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out .
Turn 483, E (Professor): but I {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} Well , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 484, C (Grad): So .
Turn 485, B (PhD): I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped .
Turn 486, E (Professor): but i And {disfmarker} and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there {comment} that 's missing from the dialogue .
Turn 487, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 488, E (Professor): You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing ,
Turn 489, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 490, E (Professor): but it might be , uh {pause} it might be really a {disfmarker} a pain . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way {disfmarker} the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , {comment} we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . And {disfmarker} and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! {vocalsound} that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff .
Turn 491, F (Postdoc): So much fun .
Turn 492, E (Professor): and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . "
Turn 493, C (Grad): Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . So that the {disfmarker}
Turn 494, E (Professor): Yeah . No , no , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 495, C (Grad): The only question is {disfmarker}
Turn 496, E (Professor): You - you 've talked me into that , but I {disfmarker} I just think that we should make it harder to do .
Turn 497, C (Grad): The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it .
Turn 498, E (Professor): So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so
Turn 499, F (Postdoc): Well I guess {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 500, E (Professor): I 'm sorry {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} So maybe this is a s a way out of it .
Turn 501, F (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 502, E (Professor): You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do {disfmarker} handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it .
Turn 503, C (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 504, B (PhD): So you 're saying the {disfmarker} the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting .
Turn 505, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 506, B (PhD): And then if they don't , you 're done . If they do , then he provides them access to the {disfmarker} the web site .
Turn 507, C (Grad): Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords .
Turn 508, E (Professor): W w
Turn 509, B (PhD): Or {disfmarker} a printed - out form .
Turn 510, E (Professor): There 's {disfmarker} there {disfmarker}
Turn 511, C (Grad): So ,
Turn 512, E (Professor): y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying .
Turn 513, C (Grad): Well , but {disfmarker}
Turn 514, E (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 515, B (PhD): Only if they want it .
Turn 516, C (Grad): what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . So they have to call me and ask .
Turn 517, E (Professor): No , no , no . But you aren't necessarily giving them {disfmarker} Right . But {disfmarker} we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .
Turn 518, A (PhD): 
Turn 519, C (Grad): Well , we do because of privacy . We can't just make it openly available on the web .
Turn 520, E (Professor): No , no . You 're missing the point .
Turn 521, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 522, E (Professor): We 're {disfmarker} We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this .
Turn 523, F (Postdoc): Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it .
Turn 524, E (Professor): Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the {disfmarker}
Turn 525, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 526, E (Professor): not just for fun , OK ? but to {disfmarker} to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at {disfmarker} from their memory . Um {disfmarker} and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review {disfmarker} go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone uh {disfmarker} wants to review it , uh , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that {disfmarker} is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that " I have a potential problem with these things , " then , you {disfmarker} you say " OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , " you issue them a password , i in the {disfmarker}
Turn 527, C (Grad): But the {disfmarker} the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . Because that means multiple contacts every time {disfmarker} for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . Obviously they don't have to .
Turn 528, E (Professor): I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble
Turn 529, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 530, E (Professor): we have {disfmarker}
Turn 531, C (Grad): So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen .
Turn 532, E (Professor): there 's a problem with it .
Turn 533, F (Postdoc): I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the {disfmarker} of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that uh , it 's {disfmarker} I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , but {disfmarker} but they might be able to argue " oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down " . So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint .
Turn 534, E (Professor): Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think ,
Turn 535, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 536, C (Grad): It seems to me that sending them email , saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,
Turn 537, E (Professor): because {disfmarker} Uh - huh .
Turn 538, C (Grad): If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password " , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .
Turn 539, F (Postdoc): Or we could print it up for them ,
Turn 540, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 541, F (Postdoc): I mean we could offer that {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they {disfmarker} that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . And {disfmarker} and I ha
Turn 542, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 543, F (Postdoc): I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . I mean I {disfmarker} I thought that you were {disfmarker} Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 544, E (Professor): Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that {disfmarker} having it
Turn 545, C (Grad): Having it .
Turn 546, F (Postdoc): Giving it to them .
Turn 547, C (Grad): Well the in {disfmarker}
Turn 548, E (Professor): right ? It just means they have the right to have it .
Turn 549, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 550, C (Grad): the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it ,
Turn 551, F (Postdoc): Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough .
Turn 552, C (Grad): so .
Turn 553, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 554, C (Grad): D you want me to grab one ?
Turn 555, F (Postdoc): Sh - sh well I could {disfmarker} I 'm closer .
Turn 556, C (Grad): Yeah , but you 're wired
Turn 557, F (Postdoc): I could {disfmarker}
Turn 558, C (Grad): aren't you ?
Turn 559, F (Postdoc): Yeah . That is true .
Turn 560, E (Professor): Um . {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them ,
Turn 561, F (Postdoc): I don't know {disfmarker}
Turn 562, E (Professor): I just meant that e every {disfmarker} ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a {disfmarker} a bias that is presented ,
Turn 563, F (Postdoc): Oh yeah yeah {disfmarker} oh I know .
Turn 564, E (Professor): right ?
Turn 565, C (Grad): " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . "
Turn 566, E (Professor): of {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 567, F (Postdoc): Yeah that 's true . Yeah .
Turn 568, C (Grad): " Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community .
Turn 569, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 570, C (Grad): There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . "
Turn 571, F (Postdoc): Hmm . Well that 's more open than I realized .
Turn 572, C (Grad): Well , I mean it {disfmarker} The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .
Turn 573, E (Professor): I {disfmarker}
Turn 574, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 575, E (Professor): Yeah , uh no that {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} tha
Turn 576, F (Postdoc): Tha - that 's true . That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around .
Turn 577, E (Professor): that 's right .
Turn 578, F (Postdoc): And it doesn't {comment} really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything .
Turn 579, B (PhD): I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them .
Turn 580, E (Professor): I I {disfmarker}
Turn 581, F (Postdoc): At least it more often . Yeah . It means also we don't have to g To give it to them . I mean like {disfmarker} like Morgan was saying they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker}
Turn 582, C (Grad): They just have to make sure that it is available to them .
Turn 583, F (Postdoc): It 's available to them if they ask for it .
Turn 584, E (Professor): Yeah , OK , so . wh um {disfmarker} I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I {disfmarker} I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data .
Turn 585, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 586, E (Professor): That {disfmarker} that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out ,
Turn 587, F (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 588, E (Professor): that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . But if you really think something is gonna {disfmarker} And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that {disfmarker} that is hurt by our expressing that bias .
Turn 589, F (Postdoc): Great . Great , great .
Turn 590, E (Professor): And then {disfmarker} then my concern about {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}
Turn 591, F (Postdoc): Yeah . I agree .
Turn 592, E (Professor): you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just {disfmarker} See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun {vocalsound} that people start bleeping stuff out {comment} {vocalsound} just as {disfmarker} just because they can .
Turn 593, C (Grad): It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all .
Turn 594, E (Professor): Yeah . Well I don't know . I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . You know .
Turn 595, C (Grad): Well , but they won't get that feedback .
Turn 596, E (Professor): I
Turn 597, C (Grad): All {disfmarker} no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time .
Turn 598, E (Professor): Oh they won't ?
Turn 599, C (Grad): It just sends me {disfmarker}
Turn 600, E (Professor): Oh good . So you haven't made it so much fun .
Turn 601, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 602, E (Professor): Oh good .
Turn 603, C (Grad): It just sends me the time intervals .
Turn 604, E (Professor): OK ,
Turn 605, C (Grad): And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data
Turn 606, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 607, C (Grad): because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space .
Turn 608, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 609, C (Grad): So I {disfmarker} I wanna {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it .
Turn 610, E (Professor): OK . Alright , so I think {disfmarker} Yeah so if we have if {disfmarker} i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the {disfmarker} the wording on each of these things and get it right ,
Turn 611, C (Grad): Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ?
Turn 612, E (Professor): but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} OK . Uh , fair enough . Turn about is fair play ,
Turn 613, F (Postdoc): Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that {disfmarker} that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever
Turn 614, E (Professor): Sorry .
Turn 615, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 616, F (Postdoc): and I don't know how that works . i There 's something down there about " if you agree to {disfmarker} "
Turn 617, E (Professor): I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about it with one of my background processes
Turn 618, C (Grad): I don't think so .
Turn 619, E (Professor): and I {disfmarker} uh it 's {disfmarker} uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email .
Turn 620, F (Postdoc): Ah . Fine .
Turn 621, C (Grad): Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says " you 'll be given an opportunity . "
Turn 622, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 623, F (Postdoc): Good . OK .
Turn 624, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 625, C (Grad): And so I don't think they need another signature .
Turn 626, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} Well and furthermore I {disfmarker} it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that {disfmarker} that uh if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh " OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , " uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now
Turn 627, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 628, E (Professor): so it 's {disfmarker} it 's OK .
Turn 629, F (Postdoc): Great .
Turn 630, E (Professor): Um .
Turn 631, C (Grad): So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . The problem is a lot of them are really short ,
Turn 632, F (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 633, C (Grad): and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . But I don't know how else to do it .
Turn 634, F (Postdoc): Well I s I also have this {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her {comment} hearable on the {disfmarker} on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , I mean I {disfmarker} I agree that our bias should be as {disfmarker} as expressed here , and {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you {disfmarker} the words on a {disfmarker} on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the {pause} social dynamics if they hear it .
Turn 635, C (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 636, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 637, F (Postdoc): And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people {comment} you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but {disfmarker}
Turn 638, C (Grad): Yeah I think actually {disfmarker} my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . You know , if {disfmarker} if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that .
Turn 639, F (Postdoc): Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh {disfmarker} i segment a against some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} personal {vocalsound} i th
Turn 640, C (Grad): Right . That was all mumbled ?
Turn 641, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 642, C (Grad): I think Microsoft is
Turn 643, F (Postdoc): Yeah exactly
Turn 644, A (PhD): Oh ,
Turn 645, C (Grad): Sorry transcribers .
Turn 646, F (Postdoc): Or {disfmarker} or even {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or even {comment} there was a {disfmarker} a line you know about how " hmm - mmm - mmm {comment} Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . "
Turn 647, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 648, F (Postdoc): but {disfmarker} but it was all {disfmarker} the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .
Turn 649, A (PhD): Oh , God .
Turn 650, C (Grad): They 're gonna hate this meeting .
Turn 651, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 652, F (Postdoc): Yeah that 's true .
Turn 653, C (Grad): Actually Liz will like it . You know , but .
Turn 654, E (Professor): Liz will like it . We had a pretty strong disagreement going there .
Turn 655, C (Grad): Yep , yep , that 's right .
Turn 656, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 657, F (Postdoc): Yeah . So I don't know . I mean , I {disfmarker} I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that {disfmarker} that my double checking will be {pause} so close to absolutely perfect that it {disfmarker} that nothing will slip by .
Turn 658, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 659, E (Professor): But it {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} some something might sometime , and they {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if it 's something that they said , they might {disfmarker} i i I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said ,
Turn 660, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 661, E (Professor): but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant .
Turn 662, F (Postdoc): I don't know how to notate that .
Turn 663, B (PhD): Sarcasm ,
Turn 664, F (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right .
Turn 665, B (PhD): how do you {disfmarker} how do you indicate sarcasm ?
Turn 666, F (Postdoc): Yeah that 's right .
Turn 667, E (Professor): No , I 'm serious . So {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} i the {disfmarker} so we might {disfmarker} we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not {disfmarker} not really what I said .
Turn 668, C (Grad): Yeah . Well that would be good to get , definitely .
Turn 669, E (Professor): Yeah , but , Yeah , sure .
Turn 670, C (Grad): Just for corrections .
Turn 671, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 672, C (Grad): So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . Or mail , physical mail .
Turn 673, F (Postdoc): Yeah . Or if for leave it on their voice mail .
Turn 674, B (PhD): Any sub - word level thing . 
Turn 675, C (Grad): Any sub - wor Yeah , OK . I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex .
Turn 676, F (Postdoc): You know I just realized something , which is of {disfmarker} e th this question about the {disfmarker} uh the possible mismatch of {disfmarker} I mean i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them {disfmarker} have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . You know ?
Turn 677, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 678, F (Postdoc): I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and {disfmarker} and hear the transcript , to have that be the {disfmarker}
Turn 679, E (Professor): Well yeah , but you can't dep I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though .
Turn 680, F (Postdoc): Yeah , OK , fair enough . And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves .
Turn 681, E (Professor): And they {disfmarker} they have to {disfmarker}
Turn 682, F (Postdoc): So it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not um {disfmarker} Yeah , good .
Turn 683, E (Professor): But I mean if you were at a meeting , and {disfmarker} and you {disfmarker} you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some {disfmarker} some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh {disfmarker}
Turn 684, C (Grad): You probably won't listen to it .
Turn 685, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 686, F (Postdoc): It is true that tec that the content is technical , I {disfmarker} and so i and we 're not having these discussions which {disfmarker}
Turn 687, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 688, F (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own .
Turn 689, E (Professor): Yeah . You would think it would be rare ,
Turn 690, F (Postdoc): Just {disfmarker} It should be very rare .
Turn 691, E (Professor): I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have {disfmarker}
Turn 692, F (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah , OK .
Turn 693, C (Grad): How about them energy crises .
Turn 694, E (Professor): Yeah . I think we 're uh {disfmarker}
Turn 695, C (Grad): Done ?
Turn 696, E (Professor): Kind of done . Actually , I was gonna {disfmarker} Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or {disfmarker}
Turn 697, D (Grad): Not really . No . Um , {vocalsound} my project is going along but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh {disfmarker} the overall progress . I don't really have anything specific to {disfmarker} to talk about .
Turn 698, E (Professor): Yeah . That 's fine . I just didn't wanna go by you , if you had something .
Turn 699, D (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 700, E (Professor): You don't have anything to say .
Turn 701, B (PhD): No .
Turn 702, E (Professor): Nah .
Turn 703, C (Grad):  
Turn 704, E (Professor): Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker}
Turn 705, C (Grad): Shall we do digits ?
Turn 706, E (Professor): Oh yeah .
Turn 707, C (Grad): Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch {disfmarker}
Turn 708, D (Grad): It um
Turn 709, C (Grad): Uh , we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ?
Turn 710, B (PhD): There were quite a few . Uh .
Turn 711, C (Grad): That 's what I thought . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read .
Turn 712, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 713, C (Grad): And so we still have more than I thought we did .
Turn 714, B (PhD): Oh good .
Turn 715, C (Grad): So , we have a few more digits before we 're done .
Turn 716, B (PhD): You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something .
Turn 717, C (Grad): Oops .
Turn 718, F (Postdoc): Oh , did you do that ?
Turn 719, A (PhD): Burger King
Turn 720, C (Grad): I 'd like a burger with that ,
Turn 721, B (PhD): No I never did .
Turn 722, C (Grad): do you want fries with that ?
