Thank you."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "236060", "name": "Ms. Susie Miller (Executive Director, Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Crops)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, thank you for the invitation to appear before you today. \n              The Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Crops was formed in 2013 specifically as a means to proactively advance sustainability for the grains industry in Canada.\n              The CRSC, which is what we call it for short, is member-based and has a broad scope of members. These include grain growers, supply chain organizations, grain handlers, food processors, food service companies, and environmental and sustainability organizations.\n              Currently, we have about 50 members from across Canada. Government has no members—we exclude them from membership but they are invited to participate in our meetings and they contribute to technical committee discussions.\n              The CRSC mission drives our work and our mission is as follows: to create value for all members of Canada’s grains sector by providing a national forum for advancing, reporting on, and communicating the sustainability of Canadian grain production.\n              To this end, the Canadian grain sector, through the CRSC, is driving an industry-led initiative to gather existing information, to conduct original research, and to make publicly available comprehensive and national data about the sustainability of grain production in Canada. We intend to maintain this information online and keep the information as up to date as possible, enabling all interested parties to understand sustainable grain production and to see how it changes over time.\n              The need for this initiative was clear. There are numerous sustainability certification standards globally, some of them company-specific, but they all focus on the same issues. \n              The CRSC has determined which issues are important from across the major standards with the goal of allowing any stakeholder, regardless of which standard they use, to find the information they need on the sustainability of our production. \n              We believe this will serve a twofold objective. First, it will enable food manufacturers and food-service customers to clearly and credibly tell consumers the story of the sustainable production of the grain products they make. Second, it will help Canadian grain and oilseed producers and exporters to maintain market access for those economies or customers that require macro-level sustainability information as part of their regulations or procurement policies.\n              To accomplish this, we have first engaged with the membership itself, and then outside to buyers, customers, and the general public. This dialogue is critical to establishing a congruent approach among our members, many of whom have active programs to enhance sustainability. The CRSC offers them the opportunity to coordinate and develop synergistic approaches among these various organizations and initiatives.\n              Given that the CRSC has members that produce grain as well as members that buy and consume grain products, the CRSC assists in the understanding of the expectations of customers and societies, including environmental organizations. This understanding of the expectations of consumers and society led us to the second focus of our work, which is on the establishment of research priorities and the undertaking of research to fill knowledge gaps.\n              To ensure that information meets the needs of our stakeholders, it must be science-based and credible. In the last year, the CRSC has invested in researching the carbon life-cycle footprint of ten crops in major grain-producing provinces. As well, we conducted a survey of producer practices that relate to sustainability criteria.\n              The researching and collection of credible and relevant data is not in itself valuable without a mechanism to effectively communicate that information to those who want it or require it. To do this, we embarked on a major project to build our online grain-sustainability metrics platform.\n              As mentioned earlier, the platform will provide relevant and credible science-based data about the sustainability performance of Canadian grain producers. Although the majority of the information is about environmental sustainability, we're also providing information on social responsibility, which is about workers in the community as well as the economic viability of the industry as all three are important to our customers and consumers. We are currently in the latter stages of development and plan to have this platform launched in early 2018.\n              \n               To do this, we are using a multitude of data sources. One source of particular importance is the work that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada undertake on environmental indicators.\n              In addition, we rely on results from a number of Statistics Canada surveys, such as the agriculture census, the farm environmental management survey, and the water use survey. This survey information is complemented by our own data, which I talked about earlier, as well as that generated by the Canadian Field Print Initiative, which is another sustainability initiative undertaken by the grains industry.\n              I would also mention that we have been able to undertake this because of the contribution of the Government of Canada through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's programs, which provide funding that's matched by our members.\n              In closing, I would like to share with you the results of the research that we've conducted into the expectations of markets and civil society regarding environmental sustainability. As expected, there are definite expectations that producers handle agrochemicals, fertilizer, and manure in such a manner that they do not negatively impact water quality, and that producers maintain the productivity of soils. In addition, markets and civil society also have expectations of the agriculture industry in general for greenhouse gas reduction, the preservation and enhancement of wildlife habitat, the maintenance of sensitive areas, and the management of waste and pollution.\n              There is also an understanding within these groups that are looking for sustainable performance that ideal results will not be achieved immediately, but that there's continuous improvement over time.\n              Again, thank you for your interest."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Ms. Miller.\n              Now we have CropLife.\n              I don't know if you want to split your time , but you have up to 10 minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "177427", "name": "Mr. Dennis Prouse (Vice-President, Government Affairs, CropLife Canada)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. We appreciate the invitation today. With me is my colleague Ian Affleck, our executive director of plant biotechnology for CropLife Canada.\n              Although many aspects of the plant science industry have evolved since we were first established in 1952, our main purpose remains the same: providing tools to help farmers be more productive and more sustainable. Our members also develop products for use in a wide range of non-agricultural settings, including urban green spaces, public health settings, and transportation corridors.\n              No one has to tell Canadian farmers about the impacts of climate change because they've been dealing with them for some time. Our challenge now as an industry is to find a way to help Canadian farmers be more productive on less land and in a more sustainable way than ever before. Fortunately, Canadian farmers are some of the most rapid adaptors of new technology in the world. What we will talk about today is what Canadian farmers are doing now to improve sustainability and address climate change and how we can do even more in the future.\n              You will often hear us speaking about our industry's technologies. Most people don't think of agriculture in that way, but the pesticides that protect crops and the plant biotechnology that creates hardier and healthier crops represent leading-edge science that makes our lives better. In addition to protecting crops, pesticides and biotech crops also have an impressive story to tell about how they help protect the environment by helping farmers use less land to grow more food, preserve biodiversity, tackle climate change, and conserve natural resources.\n              Thanks to plant science technologies, Canadian farmers grow more crops on the very best of our country's farmland, leaving marginal land alone. Doing this saves 35 million acres of forest, native grass, and wetlands from being used for agriculture, thus protecting biodiversity by safeguarding habitats.\n              Far from harming biodiversity, modern agriculture is in fact a crucial part of protecting it. Biotech crops and pesticides help farmers better control pests in their fields. Before these technologies existed, farmers had to till to get rid of weeds. For those who may not be familiar with tillage, it's the practice of plowing a field to remove weeds. This is hard on the soil as it breaks down organic matter and reduces the soil's ability to retain moisture. Tillage was a big part of why the dirty thirties were so devastating. Because the soil was fragile from tilling, the dry and windy conditions resulted in precious topsoil being blown away. \n              That has changed as a result of farmers using pesticides and biotechnology in combination. Because farmers can apply herbicide, they do not need to till for weeds. As a result of advances in agricultural technology, farmers can also leave stubble to decompose right in the field, adding organic matter back into the topsoil and improving soil consistency. As a result, soil is less susceptible to wind and water erosion.\n              Reduced land use, less tillage and summer fallow, and eliminating equipment passes reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29 million tonnes a year in Canada. Making fewer passes over fields with equipment reduces diesel fuel use by up to 194 million litres a year in Canada alone. The success of biotechnology since its introduction is significant, and it's an important tool in the fight against climate change. \n              We constantly challenge ourselves as a industry, however, to do even more to give farmers access to technology that makes the world a better place. One of the challenges our industry continues to face, both in Canada and around the globe, is a regulatory system that is slow to improve new traits. \n              In spite of the annual growth in biotech crop adoption, we have not seen the predicted introduction of new crops. Eighty per cent are still in the four major field crops. What's more, the growth we had expected to see in public sector-developed products has not materialized. Seventy-five per cent of commercialized products are still coming from the leading private sector technology developers.\n              So why are we not seeing the new and innovative products in both new seeds and crop protection products to improve sustainability yields even further? The reality is that the regulatory system is failing to deliver innovation to farmers. \n              With regard to the timeline of commercialization, we've seen that the most time-consuming part of getting a biotech trait to market is actually outside of the developer's control. The cost and time involved in regulatory science and registration have increased 50% in the last decade.\n              We have seen some new consumer traits approved in Canada. The Arctic apple, produced by Okanagan Speciality Fruits, is the apple that doesn't brown after slicing. It should start being commercially available next year, and the possibility for cutting down food waste is exciting. The same holds true for any potatoes produced by J.R. Simplot, which provide protection against potato bruising and browning.\n              This is just the beginning. There are new traits in the pipeline, and they will provide improved disease, insect, and weed control. Others are designed to improve drought tolerance, saline tolerance, and nitrogen-use efficiency. There are next-generation yield, field efficiency, and ethanol traits and consumer benefits such as healthy edible oils and enhanced nutrition. The benefits of enhanced nutrition are important in the developing world, where the impact of climate change will be felt particularly hard.\n              \n               The regulatory system is limiting the ability of private and public sector developers to get new traits and crops to farmers. While private sector developers can shoulder these time and cost burdens, it's very difficult for public sector developers to see their products through all the way to commercialization.\n              It's worth noting that we're talking about technologies that, in their over two-decade history, have an unblemished safety record. There is a global scientific consensus on the safety of biotech crops, and neither Canada nor any other regulatory agency has encountered one documented case of harm. Biotech crops are not a health and safety concern for Canadians, nor are they a regulatory concern.\n              In conclusion, Mr. Chair, we're very proud of the role that our industry has played in making Canadian agriculture more productive and more sustainable than ever. Modern agriculture is very much part of the solution on climate change, both in Canada and around the world. These contributions would be greatly enhanced should Canada make a sustained effort to reform its regulatory system. Canadian farmers are eager and ready adapters of new technology. It makes sense to find a faster, more effective way to deliver them that technology, while making Canada a global centre for investment and innovation in modern agriculture. We urge the Government of Canada to help make this vision a reality. \n              Thank you, Mr. Chair.

They were very instructive.\n              We begin this study with our minds fully open. Changes in climate, the effects on soil quality, access to water and everything related, are vast topics. This issue is a concern for many producers all over Canada. It should also be a concern for consumers because, ultimately, everything on our plates comes from the earth, at least the vast majority of food does.\n              My question is very simple. Every time I meet groups of producers, especially producers of grains of all kinds, everyone talks about expanding their production capacity in the coming years. They are talking about doubling their production in the next 10 years. There are also government targets for a quite significant increase in exports.\n              When people talk to us about those objectives, they say nothing about the constraints associated with climate change. Everything seems fine and dandy and there seem to be no fears as to the ability to double production, to deliver the product, and to achieve the objectives. I would like to hear what you have to say about that.\n              Let’s start with the people from CropLife Canada, and then go to Ms. Miller."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "177427", "name": "Mr. Dennis Prouse", "contribution": "There is no question that ambitious goals have been set out.

There won't be that expansion without a regulatory system that is responsive enough.\n              We keep coming back to that, because those regulators hold in their hands the keys to any innovations we have. They have to go through the regulatory system. We support that regulatory system. Canada has a science-based regulatory system."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "234628", "name": "Mr. Luc Berthold", "contribution": "If I understand correctly, you are afraid that those ambitious objectives cannot be achieved if changes are not made to the way in which the industry is regulated."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "177427", "name": "Mr. Dennis Prouse", "contribution": "Yes, that is correct. We need change and reform in our regulatory system if we want to realize those goals, because they're exceptionally ambitious.

To drive the kind of innovation we need to see, Canada has to get these tools in the hands of farmers as quickly as possible and as safely as possible. In no way should we be compromising the safety of our regulatory system, but we should move it forward quickly. \n              I think you're probably looking for a specific crop."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "234628", "name": "Mr. Luc Berthold", "contribution": "Could you tell me, quickly, because time is unfortunately limited here, what the main irritant in this area is?"}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "236015", "name": "Mr. Ian Affleck", "contribution": "I would say it's in two pieces, time and cost. It takes about two to three years to get a product approved in Canada right now. A large portion of that time is spent with the file sitting in a queue and not being looked at, sometimes for 12 months. If we could get it started faster, it would be finished faster.\n              The second is the overall data requirements and the cost. That's very limiting to small start-up companies who may want to get into this space. They have a hard time getting started because they can't meet those overall regulatory costs that the big companies can.\n              If we want to see broad innovation in a lot of small niche markets that are going to build toward this greater goal, we need to impact those costs so we can get those smaller players. Okanagan is a great example of a smaller player. They had to raise a lot of capital to get through that regulatory process to get that product on the market."}, {"turn": 15, "speakerID": "234628", "name": "Mr. Luc Berthold", "contribution": "Ms. Miller, along the same lines, is the objective of doubling production incompatible with the idea of sustainable agriculture?

From an individual farmer's perspective, they're dealing with the conditions they're facing right at the moment.

One of the contributions we're trying to make is to let them know exactly what's required.\n              For example, and my colleague talked about it, the adoption of tillage has benefits from an environmental perspective, but it also has benefits from a financial perspective."}, {"turn": 19, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Berthold.\n              Mr. Peschisolido, the floor is now yours for six minutes."}, {"turn": 20, "speakerID": "216084", "name": "Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Steveston—Richmond East, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thank you Mr. Chair.\n               I'd like to thank all the witnesses for appearing before us today.\n              All of you touched on the need to expand production—we get more stuff from fewer factors—but also the need to do it in a sustainable way, to limit the bad impact that occurs on soil, water, the environment.\n              You talked about two other things. You implied there were funding issues, but you also talked about a regulatory regime.\n              Ms. Miller, I was fascinated by your initiatives. You talked about a few initiatives and that you have a matching funds program. \n              Where do you think the government could gear its funds to help you in obtaining the goals you'd like to do?"}, {"turn": 21, "speakerID": "236060", "name": "Ms. Susie Miller", "contribution": "Thank you for the question.\n              I think there are some things we have found during the last four years. \n              One is the importance of dialogue. It's not evident that people talk to each other, or different organizations talk to each other. When you're trying to bridge the gap from the market all the way back to the producers, but also including civil society and environmental groups, which we're trying very hard to do, it takes time to generate that particular understanding.\n              I think the second area is in the investment in data. There's a lot of investment in data, a lot of talk about big data, efforts made for open data, but not necessarily in a way that can be used for our purposes. We're trying to do something new here. As we try to do something new, we're hoping it will inform those kinds of decisions."}, {"turn": 22, "speakerID": "216084", "name": "Mr. Joe Peschisolido", "contribution": "Ms. Miller, there are those who participate in that dialogue who deny climate change.

For example, for manure, there is more of an emphasis on storage because it just doesn't appear overnight or get used overnight, so there's a storage period. However, the principles are the same. You use the right product, in the right amount, at the right time, and in the right place, which are actually the four Rs that Fertilizer Canada is promoting. That's exactly what they want. The issue with fertilizers, other than the incidental potential contamination while it's being stored, is that it be utilized by the crop and not be available for runoff into water."}, {"turn": 26, "speakerID": "216084", "name": "Mr. Joe Peschisolido", "contribution": "Okay.\n              Mr. Prouse, you mentioned something that I think is key. I apologize, but I'm going to paraphrase. You'd like the government to help in realizing the dream of better yields. Can you elaborate on how we can do that both on the funding side and on the side of our regs?"}, {"turn": 27, "speakerID": "177427", "name": "Mr. Dennis Prouse", "contribution": "Sure.\n              My colleague, Ian, referred to it somewhat regarding speeding up the approval process. Right now, we look at that two- to three-year period. If we want to make Canada a leader in biotech and in investment, we should be able to drive that down to a one-year period. There's no cost to the government for that. That's simply a matter of applying better principles and speeding up the process.\n              On funding, it's making sure that those regulatory agencies are fully staffed, so they can deal with not only the technical requirements, but also a lot of trade issues that are now involved. For example, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency not only deals with health and safety issues, but they also end up dealing with issues of what's called MRL, maximum residue limits, that have impacts on trade. Are those regulatory agencies staffed well enough to provide the resources that are going to be required? That would be the funding issue that would come up for us.\n              However, the reform of the regulatory system—and my colleague, Ian, could speak to that more fully—is something that we're pushing because we want to make Canada a centre for that investment in biotech.

It's also far more accessible to smaller businesses, because the cost of innovation goes down. This really could create a much more diverse innovation marketplace.\n              Going back to the U.S. and how they compare, on average they're faster than we are, but not by a lot. If you look at the average, you'll see that it's, say, 18 months versus 24. They do have some interesting policy tools, whereby if you bring in something that looks a lot like something else, they can bridge it and give you a very quick approval in four to six months for very similar products. Where their system slows down is that it can become very litigious. You can sue those government agencies, which then jams things up for 12 years. It's excellent that Canada stands on science and doesn't have that problem.\n              The biggest interest is in their proposals about what we are going to do in the future. We have 20 years of history in regulating these products, and never have we or anyone in the world seen a problem. Are we going to put that same level of regulatory barrier in front of the next generation of products when we can learn from the last 20 years and maybe have a more modernized approach?

They need to draw on the tools from every production practice they can find in order to get what works on their farms, but there are some specific technologies that are coming or could come in terms of having crops that will survive when they're under water for a few days, so that when they come out of the water, they'll still grow.\n               These are in laboratories. The idea is there, but unfortunately, if these are being carried by companies, return on investment becomes critical to them making it to the marketplace. The major cost there is the regulatory science required to get through regulation. If that barrier is high, those products will take longer to come to market, because the demand won't be as high until the climate situation becomes more serious. The lower those barriers, the faster they will come to market, and the more small players you will have bringing in more and unique products to put in that farmer's tool box. That is one of the major pieces.\n              On the apple, for example, we don't have service standards for biotechnology approvals in Canada. They had no idea how long it would take.

If things are starting to change faster, it's going to take us a long time to catch up to that change. When you start to have more efficient regulation, you reduce the data requirements because of the history of safe use and you can bring that down to nine years.

For almost 100 years, CHC has advocated on important issues that impact Canada's horticultural sector, promoting the continued success of our industry as it delivers healthy, safe, and sustainable food to Canadians.\n              The horticultural sector stands behind the federal government's goal in budget 2017 to increase agrifood exports to $75 billion by 2025. However, producers face many challenges, including environmental challenges and competition from countries with laxer regulations or regulations not based on science. The federal government can help address these challenges by recognizing all kinds of agricultural fuels in its national carbon policy and by supporting additional research and innovation in the horticultural sector."}, {"turn": 82, "speakerID": "236063", "name": "Mr. Jan VanderHout (Member of the Environment Committee, Canadian Horticultural Council)", "contribution": "Canadian producers have a vested interest in sustainable growing practices and environmental stewardship, and growers often invest in programs and new technology that help to mitigate these risks. For example, greenhouse growers have developed innovative ways to recycle the carbon they produce as food-grade CO2 for their plants. However, such sustainable innovation has not been recognized in a uniform way across Canada, resulting in disparate carbon pricing policies among provinces.\n              The added costs of these policies, together with the capital-intensive infrastructure needed for the construction of greenhouse facilities, make the sector vulnerable to carbon leakage, whereby companies, in an attempt to remain competitive, expand their operations in jurisdictions that aren't subject to carbon pricing, such as the U.S. and Mexico. Due to the global nature of the produce market, new costs of production are not easily passed on to consumers. This reality impacts the price of domestically grown food in the marketplace and, ultimately, Canada's competitiveness.\n              While fruit and vegetable growers are committed to environmentally friendly production practices, the are also dependent on favourable energy costs and a stable, supportive tax regime to remain competitive and stay in business.\n              CHC urges the federal government to include natural gas and propane in its list of proposed agricultural fuels exempt from its national carbon pricing policy, as these fuels produce exhaust that is partly recycled by greenhouses as food-grade CO2, enhancing plant growth. This exemption would minimize the regional disparity seen in the current pricing models and support Canada's upcoming food policy by increasing access to affordable food; improving health and food safety; conserving our soil, water, and air; and growing more high-quality food."}, {"turn": 83, "speakerID": "230053", "name": "Ms. Rebecca Lee", "contribution": "CHC continues to advocate on behalf of growers through the Pest Management Regulatory Agency's process for the re-evaluation of crop protection products and for improvements to the policies that guide the PMRA's regulatory decisions.\n              CHC also continues to advocate for the harmonization of many aspects of the pesticide regulatory system, including maximum residue limits and joint international reviews. In this vein, we also continue to support the Pest Management Centre's minor use pesticide program and pesticide risk reduction activities.\n              Because plant health, biosecurity, and up-to-date pest risk assessments are all key components to market access and are important to the protection fo the environment, CHC develops and advances crop protection management policies and programs that support market access and promote the economic viability and competitiveness of Canada's fruit and vegetable growers, while providing safe, healthy food to consumers across Canada.\n              Climate change and growth in international trade also mean the introduction of many new pests in Canadian horticulture. Regulatory agencies must respond to these new invasive pests and plant diseases more quickly than ever before. These challenges are increasingly important and costly to manage as we endeavour to reduce our carbon footprint and feed a growing global population.\n              CHC urges the federal government to provide adequate funding for the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the Pest Management Centre, to ensure access to appropriate crop protection tools and adequate inspection services. Without increased support, these agencies will be limited in their ability to respond rapidly to invasive pests and plant diseases, which in turn jeopardizes the health of our industry and Canada's ability to meet export targets.\n              Finally, I would like to provide comment on a few other areas where CHC continues to advocate for our producers' growth in a safe and sustainable way.\n              CHC urges the government to support research by increasing funds for the Canadian agricultural partnership. During consultations on the governments's next agricultural policy framework, we outlined how we need additional support to advance the environmental sustainability of our sector. We believe that this can be achieved by aligning programming between the Canadian agricultural partnership and the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change.\n              Access to water and advanced irrigation technology will be critical for fruit and vegetable growers to be able to deal with more severe and more frequent extreme events. Government policy support and infrastructure projects are needed to secure a supply of good, clean water for agricultural purposes. CHC recommends that Canadian agricultural water infrastructure investments be supported by low-cost loans through the newly created Canada infrastructure bank. \n              CHC also urges the government to support innovation in the horticultural sector. For example, tree fruit growers have put together a proposal that would innovate and grow the apple sector in Canada, which would in turn increase agrifood exports.\n              We encourage the government to work collaboratively across departments and with industry stakeholders to leverage our combined resources and expertise to ensure that Canada is presented with climate change and conservation polices that are balanced and without unintended consequences for farmers, Canadians, and the global food supply.\n              Thank you for your time.

The council is very delighted to be able to take part in your study on soils because we are very interested in soils.\n              I am Alan Kruszel. I'm the chairman of this fine association called the Soil Conservation Council of Canada. I have a farm about an hour and half southeast of here, near Cornwall, Ontario, where we grow cash crops.\n              I'll say a little bit about the council. We are the only national soil care organization in Canada. We provide leadership, improve understanding, facilitate communications, encourage sound policy, and work collaboratively with anyone who wants to talk about soils. We are the face and voice of soil conservation in Canada. \n              We've done a couple of different things over the last number of years. I'll highlight them quickly for you.\n              We co-hosted the sixth World Congress on Conservation Agriculture back in 2014 in Winnipeg, where more than 400 attendees from more than 100 different countries all came together to talk about conservation agriculture and what we can do to improve things around the globe.\n              We hosted a conservation practitioners meeting with our friends from the CRSC, Susie's group. We talked with agriculture groups and environmental groups like the World Wildlife Fund and Ducks Unlimited to see if we could come up a shared vision for the ag landscape across Canada. We were very proud to be able to come out with a joint statement on that vision.\n              We've hosted national and regional soils summits. Our most recent one was held in Lloyd's riding back in August. We had more than 180 people come in to talk about the costs and consequences of soil degradation across Canada.\n              We have a really fun project going on called “soil your undies”. We'll talk a bit more about that later. It's actually a scientific test where you bury cotton underwear in the ground. You leave it for a few months, dig it back up, and see the results of the decomposition. If it is very decomposed, in general you can assume that there's some pretty healthy biological activity going on in your soils. It's lots of fun.\n              \n              In French, it's called Salissez vos bobettes."}, {"turn": 86, "speakerID": "234393", "name": "Mr. John Barlow", "contribution": "You take them off first, though.\n              \n                Some hon. members: Oh, oh!"}, {"turn": 87, "speakerID": "236049", "name": "Mr. Alan Kruszel", "contribution": "You certainly do.\n              Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, soil conservation is not something that is done. We have made great strides in this country on conserving our soils. We are no longer the dirty thirties. We have made some vast improvements, but there is an enormous amount of stuff that still needs to be done.\n              Today, we're going to focus on a couple of things—tillage and organic matter losses. Those are the biggies that we want to talk to you about today. These are still huge issues. If I keep spewing off words like “organic matter”, think carbon. If we are losing carbon from our soils, that is a problem. We are still losing quite a bit of carbon from our Canadian agricultural soils.\n              Western Canada is doing better than eastern Canada, I have to say. So to our colleagues from the west, congratulations, you've done a pretty good job, although there's still work to be done. Recently, the council has noticed that there is a little bit more tillage going on in western Canada than there used to be. There are vertical tillage tools coming out now that are quite prominent around Alberta and Saskatchewan, on land that was previously not tilled, direct seeded, with no disturbance at all. That's a little worrisome as far as we're concerned.\n              No-till adoption—planting without any tillage—in eastern Canada, however, is still very, very low. Our estimates are that about one-third of cropland is planted using no-till practices—that comes from the census—but there is much, much less permanent no-till area.\n              Another issue we've discovered, which we're going to bring to your attention, although I'm sure those of you who live in urban ridings have seen this, is that urban sprawl is removing productive land from agriculture. It's a huge, huge issue. We have to do something about that.\n              We talk about tillage as something that is the equivalent of an earthquake, a hurricane, a tornado, and a forest fire all occurring simultaneously for the world of soil organisms. It's a huge, huge issue for soil organisms. Tillage is bad for the soil.\n              One of the foremost experts on carbon is Dr. Rattan Lal of Ohio State University. He suggests that since modern agriculture has happened, we've lost somewhere between 50% and 70% of the original carbon that was stored in our soils. That is an absolutely huge amount of carbon that has been lost to the air, and most of this has been due to tillage.\n              The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, estimates about a 0.3% loss in annual crop yield due to soil erosion. That 0.3% doesn't sound like very much, but when you take that on a global scale, that works out to losing around 4.5 million hectares of production every year. Four and a half million hectares is nearly 10% of Canada's cropland every year being lost to soil erosion. That's a huge, huge issue.\n              What we are trying to do on our farm, and what we've been promoting, is no-till practices, trying to keep the soil covered as long as absolutely possible. We've planted cover crops on our farm to try to hold soil in place, to try to provide nutrients back to the organisms in the soil. This is what we're trying to promote in the areas where we can get these things to grow.\n              As for opportunities, we obviously have work to do to increase no-till acres across the country. There are huge benefits for climate change to going no-till. You're going to use less fuel to get your crop into the ground. You're going to have carbon sequestered in the soil and out of the air. These are win-win situations. \n              There's an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the costs and consequences of soil degradation. We're not really sure how much degradation is costing us in Canada. There have been some estimates from Dr. David Lobb at the University of Manitoba which suggest that Canada is losing around $3 billion—that's billion with a “b”—per year in lost production due to soil degradation, so there obviously is still work to be done to maintain our soil health.\n              Research needs are constantly evolving. We need to work harder to bridge the gap between the research folks and the producers who are trying to use this research. Extension at Agriculture Canada isn't anywhere near what it used to be. There's incredible research being done at all the centres across Canada, but farmers aren't hearing about it as quickly as they should. I live an hour and a half from the Ottawa centre, and I hear hardly anything about what's going on. We have to improve communications between researchers and farmers.\n              \n              We have to get some extensions and demonstrations out to the producers, host field days. Farmers will adopt technologies when they see that they work, especially if you take them to their peers who have tried them. You have to get this stuff out to their peers. That's very, very powerful for farmers. \n              Unfortunately, we still see some great information that sits on shelves and never gets out to the folks who could make good use of it. Producers really do want to do the right thing. However, change is very slow to happen, and most don't realize how detrimental some of those conventional practices and conventional tillage are to the soil.\n              We have a couple of very simple recommendations for the committee to consider.\n              The first is to make soil conservation health a key commitment under the Canadian agricultural partnership. The new Growing Forward 3, or whatever you like to call it, is coming out in April 2018. This is the time to make sure that soil health and soil conservation play a key role in that very large agreement.\n              The second is to work with stakeholders to develop a long-term national strategy on how to better promote soil conservation and improve soil health. The Province of Ontario has recently launched its soil health and conservation strategy. We would encourage the federal government to look into doing something very similar.\n              Third is to provide some funding for a national study to reassess the cost and consequences of soil degradation in Canada, with an emphasis on greenhouse gas implications, and to enhance the knowledge and demonstration and dissemination of this knowledge, and the latest BMPs, best management practices. There are some great best management practices being developed at Ag Canada and other research stations that need to get out to producers. We need more funding to get those extension people out there to show these things.\n              We have a final thought. It's a quote from Maya Angelou, a poet from the United States. She said, “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” That is very, very apt for agriculture. Farmers are trying their very best to do the best they can. They need to learn that there are better ways to do things, and they will adapt.\n              Thank you very much."}, {"turn": 88, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you. \n              I must apologize.

I particularly want to speak to it as modelled by some of our work at USC Canada.\n              I am pleased to be here with Geneviève Grossenbacher, our program manager for policy and campaigns at USC Canada, who is herself an ecological farmer based just north of Ottawa.\n              USC Canada is a Canadian success story. You may know of us. We were founded by Lotta Hitschmanova as the Unitarian Service Committee back in 1945. We’ve inspired generations of Canadians to contribute to issues of global concern. Our work on agricultural biodiversity overseas has in part been funded by Global Affairs Canada since the early 1990s. Our work with Canadian farmers is much more recent. It was launched in 2011 and is funded by The W. Garfield Weston Foundation and by donations from individual Canadians.\n              We’re here primarily to ask the Government of Canada to support programs that conserve and enhance on-farm agricultural biodiversity. That biodiversity is our most precious resource, and it provides the best insurance policy for managing the uncertainty and risk presented by our changing climate.\n              I am an accountant by training. In finance and investment, we are advised to maintain diversified portfolios. Diversified portfolios reduce risk, and they ultimately lead to the most consistent long-term success. That same principle holds true in agriculture. Biodiversity simply provides for resilience.\n              This is actually the nature of genetics. Seeds are tiny packets of potential. They contain some traits that we can see, but others, such as the ability to survive drought or the resistance to pests or disease, appear only when a plant experiences stress. The more biodiversity we keep in our seed supply, the more likely it is that our crops will have the traits they need for a wide range of conditions. But biodiversity is not static. Selecting the best seeds, saving them, and replanting them the following year keeps those crops evolving and adapting as the conditions change around them. The more diversity of seeds farmers can access and the more diverse traits these seeds have, the better Canada's food supply can adapt to climate stresses.\n              A broad range of plant genetics can ensure that crops yield good harvests even in challenging conditions, but biodiversity in and of itself is not enough. As we think about our agricultural methods, we must also pay attention to the health of the soil ecology and water systems that are quite literally at agriculture's roots. \n              Evidence is growing that the integration of biodiversity practices within ecological agricultural systems provides significant benefits to the health of water and soil. The IAASTD—if you don't know that acronym, you can ask Gen to explain it later—report from 2008 was one of the first broad reviews of scientific literature that came to that conclusion. More recently, the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, IPES-Food, published a report entitled “From Uniformity to Diversity”, which references many studies that provide a comprehensive argument for farms of all scales to employ biodiverse ecological techniques. The benefits of such an approach include: strong potential for carbon sequestration; increased diversity and quantity of beneficial microbiotic organisms in the soil; improved water absorption and retention; decreased runoff and contamination of surface and groundwater; and increased species diversity of plants, insects, and birds in surrounding ecosystems.\n              The authors of the IPES-Food study describe a virtuous, positive feedback loop created within biodiverse ecological agriculture and leading to continued improvements in soil fertility, productivity, and ecosystem health, while providing secondary benefits to communities downstream. These improvements and benefits all lend themselves to supporting the adaptive resilience of our food production, farmers, and rural communities as we move into this era of climate change. \n              \n               This is a unique moment. Yesterday COP23 opened, reminding us of the significant climate commitments Canada has made as part of the Paris climate agreement. The launch of the new Canadian agricultural partnership and the development of a food policy for Canada presents an opportunity for Canada to launch programs that incentivize agricultural innovation toward addressing climate change. We must seize this opportunity to support on-farm biodiversity. \n              USC Canada's Canadian field program, the Bauta Family Initiative for Canadian Seed Security, is a model for how Canadian farmers can work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Through participatory plant breeding, farmers are developing new seed varieties that are locally adapted and perform well in low-input conditions. This low-cost approach to genetic innovation can have a significant impact. For example, in partnership with the University of Manitoba over just the last five years, farmers in our program have been developing wheat varieties selected for their heterogeneity and their performance in low-input environments which, when tested against conventional varieties, show greater early vigour, better disease resistance, and greater concentration of micronutrients, all the while being competitive on yields in both drought and flood years.\n              To gain the benefits of biodiverse agriculture, research and investment cannot be focused on single traits within limited varieties of a very few crops. Innovation and adaptation must happen across the breadth of crops used in agriculture. Participatory plant breeding, putting the leadership for crop diversification back into the hands of farmers, ensures that the scope of breeding work encompasses many more varieties and allows for innovations to adapt to the specific local context. The 184 farmers engaged in our participatory plant breeding program have adapted over 400 different varieties to local growing conditions, ranging from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton and Newfoundland, and to the extreme north in Alberta. The process is replicable and scalable, and does not require huge financial resources. It can, however, have enormous impact by keeping diversity alive and adapting to new conditions, and creating new diversity through innovative farmer-research partnerships.\n              USC Canada has been working with farmers in marginal environments around the world for more than three decades. We know that many of the challenges of agricultural practices, soil erosion and degradation, high levels of water consumption, contamination, declining input efficiency, and even financial vulnerability, all of these can be mitigated by embracing biodiversity and supporting ecological practices. To this end, the Government of Canada should support programs that conserve and enhance on-farm agricultural biodiversity and, more specifically, invest in systems of knowledge development and transfer, like participatory plant breeding, to continue expanding agricultural best practices and to develop new varieties of climate-resilient crops.\n              USC Canada has been innovating on the ground with farmers and researchers for many years. Our experience substantiates expert findings that biodiversity and ecological practices are essential to feed communities today, and to protect the soil and water resources we need to feed future generations. We hope your findings will contribute to creating an enabling policy environment to support our work and those of others in our field, to make Canada a world leader in on-farm research for food security and climate adaptation.\n              Thank you very much."}, {"turn": 92, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Settle.\n              We'll begin our question round, which is for six minutes.\n              \n              Mr. Berthold is going to share his time with Mrs. Boucher."}, {"turn": 93, "speakerID": "234628", "name": "Mr. Luc Berthold", "contribution": "Yes, I am, Mr. Chair.

We know that in 2016 the federal government, Agriculture and Agri-Food, invested $649.5 million in agricultural research, which is very good, but $1.6 million went to organic, which is 0.25% of the R and D budget. \n              We know our trading partners invest a lot in research and innovation.

Yet, when we only invest a quarter of one per cent in R and D for organics, especially when we know the organic sector in Canada is growing at an incredible rate.... It is now maybe only 2.7% of the market, but it's growing rapidly, and whatever comes out of organic research can be applied to all farmers. A lot of the best practices in terms of crop rotation diversity came out of organic agriculture.\n               Again, just to bring it back to seeds, that imbalance in research is definitely there. There is virtually no investment in plant breeding for seeds. All of the attention is going to genetic engineering or plant biotech. That needs to happen, but the sector of organic plant breeding is incredible. We have had great results in Canada showing that the seeds developed to perform well without inputs perform well both in years of drought and in years of flood when compared to conventional cultivars. Now, that is great for organic farmers, but those seeds could also be applied to conventional farmers to help reduce how much pesticides or fertilizers they use, and fertilizers are also a great source of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.\n               All that is to say that I think we need to invest in Canada. The biggest investment I remember from Canada was a $22-million investment last year in grains in the Prairies.

Anything that increases research and innovation funding for agriculture, in our view, is a win. There are lots and lots of opportunities.

If we're spending $650 million, it would really be nice if all of that made it out to the farming population so that everybody knows it's there.\n              There's another thing we'd like to see. Of course, research and innovation is good, but with a lot of the programs, like the previous Growing Forward program, innovators on the farm are taking risks all the time, but none of the programs will compensate them for taking those risks. \n              The programs are inherently designed to take the ideas of the innovators and then help bring on the rest of the farming population with incentives. The really early innovators don't get any incentive at all to do these things, and that's something we should change. They're taking enormous risks trying new things on their own.

The U.S. and Europe are investing in organic agriculture, and Canada, I think, can lead the way also.\n               In terms of plant breeding, the same thing is happening. The U.K. and the EU both have developed programs that are based on our programs in Canada.

We would love to have something similar in Canada.\n              Going back to what you were just saying about the knowledge transfer, we couldn't agree more that farmers need to be involved in the knowledge transfer. We need extension agents, but also we need research that takes farmers into account. This is where the participatory aspect is so important.\n               Participatory plant breeding is designed around the farmers. Farmers are at the core, the centre, of the work. They help to establish the goals of the program. They help to decide what works, what doesn't work, and what criteria they want, so that in the end, they get a product that they want, that works on their farm, and that adapts every year to the local growing conditions.

We're sure that it's going to be in the tens of billions of dollars. That's something we need to address.

It helps us to replenish our soils."}, {"turn": 167, "speakerID": "219902", "name": "Mr. Jean-Claude Poissant", "contribution": "To replenish the soils, you can rotate four or five crops, as was said earlier. That would be the ideal. \n              There is less livestock. The manure they produce help to keep the soil healthy by adding organic matter.\n              We are hearing about city sewage more and more. What do you think about it?"}, {"turn": 168, "speakerID": "236049", "name": "Mr. Alan Kruszel", "contribution": "The Council is not opposed to city sewage being used on the land. Scientists tell us that it is good for the soil. It adds nutrients and organic matter to the land.\n              Of course, the sewage has to be properly managed. Ontario, for example, has regulations about the amount of sewage, how many litres of cubic metres of sewage can be spread near setback zones, waterways, wells and so on. If it is done properly, we do not see a problem."}, {"turn": 169, "speakerID": "219902", "name": "Mr. Jean-Claude Poissant", "contribution": "Finally, do you think that the government should take steps to encourage farmers to rotate their crops or the way they work the soil?"}, {"turn": 170, "speakerID": "236049", "name": "Mr. Alan Kruszel", "contribution": "That would be a very good idea, because we have to show people that it is feasible.\n              At home, we only have three or four crops, but we do rotate them. We put in cover plants to try to make up for it. I have not yet found a market for hay. It does not work. I do not have the machinery I would need and I have no desire to invest in it. I am not good in that area. It rots in the field. So I am going to stick with my major crops.\n              If a way could be found to promote planting cover crops with major crops, it would really help us."}, {"turn": 171, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "I am going to make a final comment and put in my two bits' worth, so to speak.\n              As a farmer and an organic greenhouse operator, I would like to go back to what Ms. Grossenbacher said about research on varieties.\n              In my experience, which is starting to be lengthy, there are varieties that the large company mergers have taken out of the market. Those varieties still had unique characteristics, especially in taste, and they fit well with the conditions of my operation. But now you have to ask for an exemption each year because no organic variety would be acceptable.\n              I entirely agree that we have to invest in varieties. We must not lose them just for the benefit of large companies that will control them, take them off the market, and replace them with their own.\n              That is my final comment.\n              Thank you all."}, {"turn": 172, "speakerID": "234393", "name": "Mr. John Barlow", "contribution": "I want to quickly, for my colleagues, table a motion I'd like to discuss on Thursday, if possible."}, {"turn": 173, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Sure, table it.
