Turn 0, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 1, C (PhD): Adam , what is the mike that , uh , Jeremy 's wearing ? 
Turn 2, F (Grad): It 's the ear - plug mike .
Turn 3, A (Postdoc): Ear - plug .
Turn 4, E (PhD): That 's good .
Turn 5, C (PhD): Is that a wireless , or {disfmarker} ? Oh .
Turn 6, F (Grad): No .
Turn 7, G (Grad): It 's wired .
Turn 8, B (Professor): Oh !
Turn 9, A (Postdoc): Is that {disfmarker} Does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting ?
Turn 10, D (Grad): It 's old - school .
Turn 11, F (Grad): Huh ? What ? Huh ?
Turn 12, B (Professor): Should we , uh , close the door , maybe ?
Turn 13, F (Grad): It {disfmarker} it 's a fairly good mike , actually .
Turn 14, B (Professor): So it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Huh .
Turn 15, F (Grad): Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike . All I really know is that the signal level is OK . I don't know if it 's a {disfmarker} the quality .
Turn 16, B (Professor): Well , that 's a
Turn 17, F (Grad): Ugh ! So I didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . So . {vocalsound} And , uh .
Turn 18, B (Professor): OK . So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on {vocalsound} more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? Was that sort of {pause} the division ?
Turn 19, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 20, B (Professor): So which week are we in ?
Turn 21, F (Grad): Well {disfmarker} We haven't really started , but I thought we more {disfmarker} we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week , so I thought we could do , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 22, B (Professor): I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too .
Turn 23, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 24, F (Grad): But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .
Turn 25, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 26, F (Grad): So . I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . Here we go .
Turn 27, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 28, F (Grad): So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any {disfmarker} Ach ! {comment} {comment} any comments on them . So , no on no one has bleeped out anything .
Turn 29, B (Professor): Um . Yeah .
Turn 30, F (Grad): So . I don't expect anyone to . But .
Turn 31, B (Professor): Um . {vocalsound} So , w what follows ? At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ?
Turn 32, F (Grad): No . We had spoken w about this before
Turn 33, B (Professor): Yeah , but I 've forgotten .
Turn 34, F (Grad): and we had decided that they have {disfmarker} they only needed to sign once . And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . So as long as we do that , we 're covered .
Turn 35, B (Professor): And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ?
Turn 36, F (Grad): Uh , July fifteenth .
Turn 37, B (Professor): July fifteenth . Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y
Turn 38, F (Grad): Yep .
Turn 39, B (Professor): Given that it 's that long , um , um {disfmarker} Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to {disfmarker} ?
Turn 40, F (Grad): Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it .
Turn 41, A (Postdoc): Oh . I just meant that that was {pause} the release date that you had on the {pause} data .
Turn 42, B (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 43, F (Grad): Oh . I {disfmarker} I didn't understand that there was something specific .
Turn 44, A (Postdoc): I , uh {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker}
Turn 45, F (Grad): You {disfmarker} y you had {disfmarker}
Turn 46, B (Professor): I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 47, F (Grad): I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put .
Turn 48, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 49, B (Professor): No , the only {disfmarker} th the only {pause} mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when {vocalsound} this meeting starts .
Turn 50, F (Grad): So .
Turn 51, A (Postdoc): That 's right . That 's why .
Turn 52, B (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 53, A (Postdoc): You said you wanted it to be available then .
Turn 54, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 55, A (Postdoc): I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline .
Turn 56, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 57, A (Postdoc): It 's fine with me if it is , or we cou But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that
Turn 58, B (Professor): w
Turn 59, A (Postdoc): in case , uh {disfmarker} you know , " by the way {pause} this is your last {disfmarker} "
Turn 60, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 61, A (Postdoc): Uh . Yeah .
Turn 62, B (Professor): We probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . Right ?
Turn 63, F (Grad): Yeah . As I said , we {disfmarker} I just got one date
Turn 64, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 65, H (PhD): Damn !
Turn 66, F (Grad): and that 's the one I used .
Turn 67, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 68, F (Grad): So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us . I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these {disfmarker} the meetings that {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} are in set one .
Turn 69, C (PhD): Was my {disfmarker} was my response OK ?
Turn 70, A (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 71, C (PhD): I just wrote you {disfmarker} replied to the email saying they 're all fine .
Turn 72, F (Grad): Right . I mean , that 's fine .
Turn 73, C (PhD): OK , good .
Turn 74, F (Grad): I {disfmarker} we don't {disfmarker} My understanding of what we {pause} had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .
Turn 75, C (PhD): That makes it easy .
Turn 76, F (Grad): We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .
Turn 77, B (Professor): OK . I just didn't remember , but {disfmarker}
Turn 78, F (Grad): And so no reply is no changes .
Turn 79, A (Postdoc): And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is " OK " .
Turn 80, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 81, A (Postdoc): So that 's very clear all the way down the page , " OK " . And they have two options they can change it to . One of them is {pause} " censor " , and the other one is " incorrect " . Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} your word is " incorrect " ?
Turn 82, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 83, A (Postdoc): Which means also we get feedback on {pause} if {pause} um , there 's something that they w that needs to be {pause} adjusted , because , I mean , these are very highly technical things . I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it . But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong .
Turn 84, F (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 85, A (Postdoc): So .
Turn 86, F (Grad): Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor {disfmarker} not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,
Turn 87, A (Postdoc): And the reason I liked it was because {disfmarker}
Turn 88, F (Grad): as opposed to , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 89, A (Postdoc): was because it , um {disfmarker} it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .
Turn 90, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 91, A (Postdoc): Approve it and correct it . And {pause} um . So , you have {pause} it nicely set up so they email you and , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 92, F (Grad): When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me .
Turn 93, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder .
Turn 94, F (Grad): So .
Turn 95, A (Postdoc): The German ones will be ready for next week . Those are three {disfmarker} three of those . A different set of people . And we can impose {disfmarker}
Turn 96, C (PhD): The German ones ?
Turn 97, A (Postdoc): Uh , well .
Turn 98, H (PhD): Yeah . Those {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}
Turn 99, B (Professor): NSA .
Turn 100, A (Postdoc): OK . I spoke loosely . The {disfmarker} the German , French {disfmarker} Sorry , the German , {vocalsound} Dutch , and Spanish ones .
Turn 101, E (PhD): Spanish . Yeah .
Turn 102, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 103, C (PhD): Oh , those are the NSA meetings ?
Turn 104, E (PhD): The non - native {disfmarker}
Turn 105, H (PhD): Those are {disfmarker}
Turn 106, A (Postdoc): Yeah . Uh - huh .
Turn 107, B (Professor): German , Dutch , Swiss and Spanish .
Turn 108, C (PhD): Oh , oh ! OK .
Turn 109, E (PhD): The all non - native {disfmarker}
Turn 110, A (Postdoc): That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's r
Turn 111, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 112, H (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 113, C (PhD): OK . I 'd {disfmarker} I d
Turn 114, A (Postdoc): Yeah . {pause} It 's the other group .
Turn 115, B (Professor): I It was the network {disfmarker} network services group .
Turn 116, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 117, A (Postdoc): Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
Turn 118, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 119, A (Postdoc): I didn't mean to {pause} isolate them .
Turn 120, B (Professor): Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish .
Turn 121, A (Postdoc): Yeah . Sorry . It was {disfmarker} it was not the best characterization .
Turn 122, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 123, A (Postdoc): But what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not {disfmarker} n no m no overlap with our present members . And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like {pause} a week {pause} before that , uh , J July fifteenth date , or two weeks before .
Turn 124, B (Professor): I mean , I would suggest we discuss {disfmarker} I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,
Turn 125, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 126, B (Professor): so that we have a uniform thing . So , tha that 's a month , which is fine . I mean , it seems {disfmarker}
Turn 127, C (PhD): Twelve hours .
Turn 128, F (Grad): Well , the only thing I said in the email is that {pause} the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . I didn't give any other deadline .
Turn 129, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 130, F (Grad): So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .
Turn 131, A (Postdoc): Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .
Turn 132, F (Grad): What else can we do ?
Turn 133, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 134, F (Grad): If someone says " hey , look , I {pause} found something in this meeting and {pause} it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ?
Turn 135, A (Postdoc): Well . {pause} That 's true .
Turn 136, F (Grad): We have to remove it .
Turn 137, A (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I agree with that part , but I think that it would {disfmarker} it , uh {disfmarker} we need to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a message to them very clearly that {vocalsound} beyond this date , you can't make additional changes .
Turn 138, B (Professor): I mean , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i I think that somebody might {pause} request something even though we say that . But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that .
Turn 139, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Good .
Turn 140, B (Professor): So if we agreed , {vocalsound} OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have {disfmarker} if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , I think we should just say that {disfmarker} say that , you know , i a as {pause} um , {vocalsound} " per the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth " and , uh , because we w " these , uh {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say " because we , uh , will continually be making these things available {vocalsound} to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time " , whatever time we agree upon .
Turn 141, F (Grad): Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?
Turn 142, B (Professor): Did I ? No , I haven't yet . No , just {disfmarker}
Turn 143, F (Grad): No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ?
Turn 144, B (Professor): No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . I I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that {disfmarker} that you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you can , uh , decide on something .
Turn 145, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 146, B (Professor): So I 'm not telling you what to decide .
Turn 147, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 148, B (Professor): I 'm just saying you should decide something ,
Turn 149, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 150, B (Professor): and then {disfmarker}
Turn 151, F (Grad): I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email .
Turn 152, A (Postdoc): Yeah , yeah . OK , so {disfmarker}
Turn 153, F (Grad): And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?
Turn 154, A (Postdoc): Yeah . Well {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that there 's one missing line .
Turn 155, B (Professor): Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me {pause} was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth .
Turn 156, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 157, B (Professor): And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . So what I 'm telling you {pause} is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough
Turn 158, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 159, B (Professor): and you should use that rather than {pause} this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying .
Turn 160, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 161, B (Professor): OK ?
Turn 162, A (Postdoc): I ha I have one question . This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ? Because if someone {disfmarker}
Turn 163, B (Professor): It {disfmarker} well , it {disfmarker} well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be {pause} away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh {disfmarker} for any length of time that you {vocalsound} uh , choose {pause} there is some person sometime who will not {pause} end up reading it .
Turn 164, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 165, B (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take .
Turn 166, H (PhD): S so maybe when {disfmarker} Am I on , by the way ?
Turn 167, F (Grad): I don't know . You should be .
Turn 168, H (PhD): Oh . Hello ? Hello ?
Turn 169, F (Grad): You should be channel B .
Turn 170, H (PhD): Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um {disfmarker} Maybe we should say in {disfmarker} w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the agreement {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how {disfmarker} how they will be contacted and they can , you know {disfmarker} they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . And , um , then {disfmarker}
Turn 171, A (Postdoc): We did that , I {disfmarker} I believe .
Turn 172, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 173, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 174, H (PhD): So . {vocalsound} A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't {disfmarker} if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain {vocalsound} period after we contact them {vocalsound} that is implicitly giving their agreement .
Turn 175, F (Grad): Well , they 've already signed a form .
Turn 176, A (Postdoc): And the form says {disfmarker}
Turn 177, E (PhD): And nobody {disfmarker} nobody really reads it anyway .
Turn 178, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 179, F (Grad): So . And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects ,
Turn 180, H (PhD): Says that . Right .
Turn 181, A (Postdoc): Uh , the f
Turn 182, H (PhD): Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Turn 183, F (Grad): so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify .
Turn 184, A (Postdoc): Well , the form {disfmarker} Well , the form doesn't say , if {disfmarker} uh , you know , " if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks {disfmarker} "
Turn 185, H (PhD): I see . Uh {disfmarker} Oh , OK . So what does it say about the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the process of {disfmarker} of , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} y the review process ?
Turn 186, A (Postdoc): It doesn't have a time limit . That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to {pause} remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general {disfmarker} uh , larger audience .
Turn 187, H (PhD): Oh , OK . Hmm . Right .
Turn 188, F (Grad): Here .
Turn 189, A (Postdoc): There you go .
Turn 190, F (Grad): You can read what you already signed .
Turn 191, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 192, E (PhD): I guess when I {pause} read it , um {disfmarker}
Turn 193, H (PhD): OK .
Turn 194, E (PhD): I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date , and if you don't hear from me by then {disfmarker} " You know , in other words responding to your email {pause} once , right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . "
Turn 195, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 196, E (PhD): And then if you {disfmarker} if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? Because {disfmarker}
Turn 197, F (Grad): Oh , I just {disfmarker} I didn't wanna do that , because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person {pause} if I can avoid it .
Turn 198, E (PhD): Well , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 199, F (Grad): So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released ,
Turn 200, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 201, F (Grad): if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it " .
Turn 202, A (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I kind of like this .
Turn 203, E (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 204, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 205, E (PhD): OK . So , we 're assuming that {disfmarker}
Turn 206, H (PhD): Well , that 's {disfmarker} that would be great if {disfmarker} but you should probably have a {pause} legal person look at this and {pause} make sure it 's OK . Because if you {disfmarker} if you , uh , do this {vocalsound} and you {disfmarker} then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually {vocalsound} exercise their {disfmarker} their right {disfmarker}
Turn 207, E (PhD): Or they {disfmarker} they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . And so {pause} someone whose machine is down or whatever {disfmarker} I mean , we have no {disfmarker}
Turn 208, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 209, E (PhD): in internally we know that people are there ,
Turn 210, F (Grad): Well , OK . l Let me {disfmarker} Let me reverse this .
Turn 211, E (PhD): but we have no confirmation that they got the mail .
Turn 212, F (Grad): So let 's say someone {disfmarker} I send this out , and someone doesn't respond . Do we delete every meeting that they were in ?
Turn 213, E (PhD): Well , then {disfmarker}
Turn 214, F (Grad): I don't think so .
Turn 215, E (PhD): It {disfmarker} we 're hoping that doesn't happen ,
Turn 216, H (PhD): No .
Turn 217, E (PhD): but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail
Turn 218, F (Grad): That will happen .
Turn 219, E (PhD): or {disfmarker}
Turn 220, H (PhD): That will happen .
Turn 221, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 222, F (Grad): That will absolutely happen . Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything " and they don just won't reply to it .
Turn 223, H (PhD): Maybe {disfmarker} uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ?
Turn 224, F (Grad): No . We have what they put on the speaker form ,
Turn 225, H (PhD): No .
Turn 226, A (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker}
Turn 227, F (Grad): which was just generic contact information .
Turn 228, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 229, A (Postdoc): But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local ,
Turn 230, H (PhD): Well , then {disfmarker}
Turn 231, A (Postdoc): except the ones who {disfmarker} I mean , we {disfmarker} we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups .
Turn 232, H (PhD): Mmm . OK .
Turn 233, A (Postdoc): So maybe , uh , I {disfmarker} you know , that 's not that many people and if I {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} i i there is an advantage to having them admit {disfmarker} and if I can help with {disfmarker} with processing that , I will . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating {disfmarker}
Turn 234, F (Grad): Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago .
Turn 235, A (Postdoc): Yes , we did .
Turn 236, F (Grad): And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again .
Turn 237, A (Postdoc): You 're right . Well , I {disfmarker} you know . But sometimes {disfmarker}
Turn 238, B (Professor): Well , we {disfmarker} we haven't experienced it before .
Turn 239, F (Grad): So .
Turn 240, A (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 241, B (Professor): Right ? So {disfmarker}
Turn 242, E (PhD): You 'll either wonder {pause} at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .
Turn 243, A (Postdoc): Need to get it right .
Turn 244, E (PhD): I mean , there 's no way to get around {disfmarker} I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email .
Turn 245, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 246, E (PhD): And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before {disfmarker} you know , a little bit earlier than {disfmarker}
Turn 247, F (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 248, A (Postdoc): It 's much easier to explain {pause} this way .
Turn 249, F (Grad): OK . Well , why don't you talk {pause} t
Turn 250, A (Postdoc): T t to have it on record .
Turn 251, F (Grad): Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to .
Turn 252, A (Postdoc): Yeah , but w Mmm .
Turn 253, F (Grad): Because what {disfmarker} I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who {pause} you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with .
Turn 254, A (Postdoc): Well , then we make the effort .
Turn 255, D (Grad): I mean , i it 's k
Turn 256, F (Grad): And do we want to spend that effort ?
Turn 257, H (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 258, A (Postdoc): We make the effort .
Turn 259, D (Grad): It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways . I mean , and either way works probably , I mean .
Turn 260, A (Postdoc): Except I really think in this case {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm agr I agree with Liz , that we need to be {pause} in the clear and not have to after the fact say " oh , but I assumed " , and " oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you " , you know .
Turn 261, B (Professor): If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it .
Turn 262, A (Postdoc): Oh , excellent .
Turn 263, B (Professor): But the thing is that , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , {vocalsound} from my previous conversations with them , my {disfmarker} my sense very {pause} much is that we would want something on record {pause} as indicating that they actually were aware of this .
Turn 264, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 265, F (Grad): Well , we had talked about this before
Turn 266, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 267, F (Grad): and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form {disfmarker} that they 've already signed once .
Turn 268, A (Postdoc): I don't remember that this issue of {pause} the time period allowed for response was ever covered .
Turn 269, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 270, B (Professor): Yeah . We never really talked about that .
Turn 271, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 272, E (PhD): Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you .
Turn 273, A (Postdoc): Or {disfmarker} or how they would indicate {disfmarker}
Turn 274, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 275, E (PhD): They probably forgot all about it .
Turn 276, B (Professor): We certainly didn't talk , uh , about {disfmarker} with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being {disfmarker} {vocalsound} made the , uh , uh , materials available .
Turn 277, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 278, H (PhD): We do it like with these {disfmarker}
Turn 279, B (Professor): That was something that was sort of just within our implementation .
Turn 280, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 281, H (PhD): We can use it {disfmarker} we can use a {disfmarker} a ploy like they use to , um {disfmarker} you know , that when they serve , like {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} {comment} uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope
Turn 282, D (Grad): And they 're served .
Turn 283, H (PhD): and that {disfmarker} Right ? Because {disfmarker} and then the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing is served . So you just make it , you know , " oh , you won {disfmarker} you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} "
Turn 284, E (PhD): That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail .
Turn 285, A (Postdoc): That one .
Turn 286, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 287, F (Grad): Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was {disfmarker} you were saying let 's not do anything ,
Turn 288, H (PhD): Right . {vocalsound} Right . No , it I {disfmarker} it might {disfmarker}
Turn 289, A (Postdoc): Well , it doesn't matter .
Turn 290, H (PhD): i i it {disfmarker} it might well be the case {disfmarker}
Turn 291, F (Grad): and now we 're {disfmarker} we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ?
Turn 292, H (PhD): it might {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 293, F (Grad): I mean , what are we gonna doing here ?
Turn 294, H (PhD): It might well be the case that {disfmarker} that this is perfectly {disfmarker} you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply .
Turn 295, B (Professor): Well .
Turn 296, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 297, H (PhD): But , I 'm not {disfmarker} you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without {pause} having the {disfmarker} the expert , uh , opinion on that .
Turn 298, A (Postdoc): And how many people ? Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time .
Turn 299, F (Grad): Then I think we had better find out , so that we can find a {disfmarker}
Turn 300, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 301, B (Professor): Let me look at this again .
Turn 302, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 303, A (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I really don't see that it 's a problem . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them {disfmarker} uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ {comment} us try to contact them ,
Turn 304, F (Grad): For {disfmarker} for th
Turn 305, A (Postdoc): u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . I think they 'd appreciate it .
Turn 306, B (Professor): Yeah . My {disfmarker} Adam , my {disfmarker} my view before was about {pause} the nature of what was {disfmarker} of the presentation ,
Turn 307, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 308, B (Professor): of {disfmarker} of how {pause} my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy {disfmarker} uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to {disfmarker}
Turn 309, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 310, B (Professor): That was the kind of dispute I was making before .
Turn 311, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . I remember that .
Turn 312, B (Professor): But , um , the attorneys , I {disfmarker} uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with {disfmarker} and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying {vocalsound} that , um , you need to {disfmarker} you want to have someth some paper trail or {disfmarker} which includes electronic trail {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that they have , uh , in fact {pause} O K 'd it .
Turn 313, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 314, B (Professor): So , um , I think that if you f i if {pause} we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond {pause} at all by , you know , some period of time , {vocalsound} we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh {disfmarker} you know , just give it to me and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever ,
Turn 315, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 316, B (Professor): and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is this OK ? And would you please mail {disfmarker} you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . " So , you know , we can {disfmarker} we can do that .
Turn 317, E (PhD): The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that {disfmarker} at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it {comment} {pause} later {pause} than to just ignore it .
Turn 318, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 319, E (PhD): And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , but it {disfmarker} it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the {disfmarker} their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd {comment} at al at all . That 's how these mailing houses work . So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting {pause} responses .
Turn 320, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 321, E (PhD): You know , an official OK from somebody {pause} is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email .
Turn 322, A (Postdoc): I also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . I think it 's a good {disfmarker} a good way of {disfmarker} of fostering goodwill among our subjects . Well , our participants .
Turn 323, B (Professor): I think the main thing is {disfmarker} I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases .
Turn 324, F (Grad): Sending lots of spam .
Turn 325, B (Professor): So they s so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do .
Turn 326, F (Grad): Yep .
Turn 327, B (Professor): And so , {vocalsound} it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . So , {vocalsound} what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,
Turn 328, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 329, B (Professor): but if in fact {disfmarker} if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , {vocalsound} um , then we haven't given them that .
Turn 330, F (Grad): Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ? Or , is email enough ?
Turn 331, B (Professor): I i i em email is enough .
Turn 332, F (Grad): Do we have to have it notarized ? I mean {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 333, B (Professor): Yeah . I mean , I 've been through this {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now
Turn 334, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 335, B (Professor): so I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} I I 'm pretty comfortable with that .
Turn 336, C (PhD): Do you track , um , when people log in to look at the {disfmarker} ?
Turn 337, F (Grad): Uh . If they submit the form , I get it .
Turn 338, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 339, F (Grad): If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient .
Turn 340, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 341, F (Grad): Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't {pause} imply anything in particular .
Turn 342, C (PhD): Except that you know they got the mail .
Turn 343, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . That 's right .
Turn 344, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 345, A (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I could get you on the notify list if you want me to .
Turn 346, F (Grad): I 'm already on it .
Turn 347, A (Postdoc): For that directory ? OK , great .
Turn 348, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 349, B (Professor): So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because {vocalsound} uh , we 're talking a pretty small {pause} number of people .
Turn 350, F (Grad): W For this set , I 'm not worried , because {pause} we basically know everyone on it .
Turn 351, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 352, A (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 353, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 354, F (Grad): You know , they 're all more or less here or it 's {disfmarker} it 's Eric and Dan and so on . But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are {pause} gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work ,
Turn 355, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 356, A (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 357, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 358, F (Grad): and {disfmarker} So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ?
Turn 359, A (Postdoc): I don't think , uh {disfmarker} They 're so recent , these visitors .
Turn 360, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 361, A (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} they 're also so {disfmarker}
Turn 362, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 363, A (Postdoc): They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I w I 'll be able to {disfmarker} if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them .
Turn 364, F (Grad): Other methods ? OK .
Turn 365, B (Professor): Yeah . Cuz it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and {disfmarker} and ask their permission {vocalsound} and they 're not there , it doesn't seem {comment} that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So .
Turn 366, F (Grad): Well , the qu the question is just whether {disfmarker} how active it has to be . I mean , because they {disfmarker} they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information .
Turn 367, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 368, F (Grad): And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method .
Turn 369, B (Professor): Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc {vocalsound} have forwards to other accounts and so on .
Turn 370, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 371, B (Professor): So it 's unusual that {disfmarker} that they , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 372, F (Grad): So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that {pause} we fulfilled our burden .
Turn 373, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 374, E (PhD): Then they just come back .
Turn 375, C (PhD): All my files were still here .
Turn 376, E (PhD): Same as us .
Turn 377, A (Postdoc): I just {disfmarker}
Turn 378, B (Professor): So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it .
Turn 379, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 380, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 381, B (Professor): But , you know , hopefully we won't need to .
Turn 382, A (Postdoc): I d I just don't think we will . For all the reasons that we 've discussed .
Turn 383, F (Grad): Alright .
Turn 384, B (Professor): So we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see if we do or not .
Turn 385, F (Grad): Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .
Turn 386, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 387, F (Grad): So far , two people have .
Turn 388, B (Professor): Yeah . I think very few people will
Turn 389, F (Grad): So .
Turn 390, B (Professor): and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you know , people {disfmarker} people see long emails about things that they don't think {vocalsound} is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't {disfmarker} don't read it , or half read it .
Turn 391, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 392, B (Professor): Cuz people are swamped .
Turn 393, A (Postdoc): And actually ,
Turn 394, B (Professor): But {disfmarker}
Turn 395, A (Postdoc): um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} didn't anticipate this so I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't give this comment , and it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date and please {disfmarker} " , and then add what Liz said {disfmarker} " please , uh , respond to {disfmarker} please indicate you received this mail . "
Turn 396, B (Professor): Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , " Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that " .
Turn 397, F (Grad): Respond to the email . {comment} Yep .
Turn 398, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . It is the first time through the cycle .
Turn 399, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 400, E (PhD): Right . That would {disfmarker} that would definitely work on me . You know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . Whereas , I {disfmarker} I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,
Turn 401, C (PhD): And the other th
Turn 402, E (PhD): given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , and never really , {vocalsound} uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .
Turn 403, C (PhD): Yeah . I was {disfmarker} I was thinking that it also {pause} lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to {pause} accept this .
Turn 404, E (PhD): Right . R Right . That 's true .
Turn 405, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 406, C (PhD): I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Yeah . So that way they could {disfmarker} they can see from that email that if they just write back and say " I got it , no changes " , they 're off the hook .
Turn 407, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 408, C (PhD): They don't have to go to the web page
Turn 409, B (Professor): I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with {disfmarker} dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , {vocalsound} if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , {vocalsound} um , people do it , you know , {vocalsound} two and seven eighths months from now .
Turn 410, C (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 411, E (PhD): Yeah . That 's true .
Turn 412, B (Professor): If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do {disfmarker} do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they do the review .
Turn 413, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 414, B (Professor): And , um {disfmarker} So , if we make it {pause} a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much {disfmarker}
Turn 415, F (Grad): Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .
Turn 416, B (Professor): There 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ?
Turn 417, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 418, B (Professor): Then {vocalsound} we actually have to deal with that
Turn 419, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Some lead time .
Turn 420, B (Professor): if we want it to {disfmarker}
Turn 421, F (Grad): Ugh ! Disk space ,
Turn 422, A (Postdoc): By the way , has {disfmarker} has Jeremy signed the form ?
Turn 423, F (Grad): oh my god ! I hadn't thought about that .
Turn 424, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 425, F (Grad): That for every meeting {disfmarker} any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of .
Turn 426, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 427, C (PhD): Just that channel .
Turn 428, D (Grad): Can't you just do that channel ?
Turn 429, C (PhD): Oh , no . We have to do {disfmarker}
Turn 430, F (Grad): No , of course not .
Turn 431, E (PhD): Yeah . You have to do all of them ,
Turn 432, F (Grad): You need all the channels .
Turn 433, D (Grad): Oh .
Turn 434, C (PhD): Do you have to do the other close - talking ?
Turn 435, E (PhD): as well as all of these .
Turn 436, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 437, E (PhD): You have to do all {disfmarker} You could just do it in that time period , though ,
Turn 438, F (Grad): Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .
Turn 439, G (Grad): Wow .
Turn 440, A (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 441, E (PhD): but I guess it 's a pain .
Turn 442, F (Grad): Well , but you have to copy the whole file .
Turn 443, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 444, F (Grad): Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file .
Turn 445, E (PhD): Yeah . You 're right .
Turn 446, A (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy .
Turn 447, F (Grad): Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . So I {disfmarker} I don't want {disfmarker} I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out
Turn 448, B (Professor): Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?
Turn 449, F (Grad): and then {disfmarker} Overlapping . So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's exactly a censor bleep . So what I really think is " bleep "
Turn 450, B (Professor): I I I I understand , but is {disfmarker} is it summing signals
Turn 451, F (Grad): and then I want to {disfmarker}
Turn 452, B (Professor): or do you {pause} delete the old one and put the new one in ?
Turn 453, F (Grad): I delete the old one , put the new one in .
Turn 454, B (Professor): Oh , OK . Cuz {disfmarker}
Turn 455, F (Grad): There 's nothing left of the original signal .
Turn 456, B (Professor): Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could {disfmarker} No . But anyway {disfmarker}
Turn 457, F (Grad): Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again .
Turn 458, A (Postdoc): But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know ,
Turn 459, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 460, E (PhD): Then someday we can sell the {pause} unedited versions .
Turn 461, A (Postdoc): cuz {disfmarker} cuz the {disfmarker} the ones {disfmarker}
Turn 462, F (Grad): Say again ?
Turn 463, A (Postdoc): Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the {disfmarker} ?
Turn 464, C (PhD): Or {pause} we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep
Turn 465, B (Professor): Encrypt it .
Turn 466, C (PhD): and then they could subtract the beep out .
Turn 467, D (Grad): You can hide it . Yeah .
Turn 468, A (Postdoc): Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ?
Turn 469, H (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 470, D (Grad): It wouldn't be that hard to hide it .
Turn 471, E (PhD): Right . Exactly . I see .
Turn 472, F (Grad): Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true .
Turn 473, E (PhD): See , this is good . I wanted to create some {pause} side conversations in these meetings .
Turn 474, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 475, B (Professor): Yeah . You could encrypt it , you know , with a {disfmarker} with a two hundred bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} thousand bit , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 476, D (Grad): You can use spread spectrum .
Turn 477, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 478, D (Grad): Hide it .
Turn 479, E (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 480, C (PhD): Here we go .
Turn 481, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 482, D (Grad): Yeah , there you go .
Turn 483, E (PhD): Cuz we don't have enough asides .
Turn 484, H (PhD): I have an idea . You reverse the signal ,
Turn 485, D (Grad): There you go .
Turn 486, H (PhD): so it {disfmarker} it lets people say what they said backwards .
Turn 487, F (Grad): Backwards .
Turn 488, D (Grad): Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages ,
Turn 489, F (Grad): But , ha you 've seen the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments .
Turn 490, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 491, D (Grad): like .
Turn 492, F (Grad): Did you read that paper ? It wouldn't work .
Turn 493, H (PhD): No .
Turn 494, F (Grad): The speech recognizer still works .
Turn 495, E (PhD): Yeah . And if you do it backward then {disfmarker}
Turn 496, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 497, C (PhD): That 's cuz they use forward - backward .
Turn 498, E (PhD): H - good old HMM .
Turn 499, F (Grad): Forward but backward . That 's right .
Turn 500, E (PhD): No , it 's backward - forward .
Turn 501, F (Grad): Good point . A point . Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved .
Turn 502, A (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 503, B (Professor): Well , but we never also {disfmarker} we 've also never done it .
Turn 504, E (PhD): Uh .
Turn 505, F (Grad): So .
Turn 506, A (Postdoc): This is the first cycle .
Turn 507, E (PhD): If it makes {disfmarker}
Turn 508, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 509, A (Postdoc): There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through .
Turn 510, B (Professor): So . {vocalsound} And , uh {disfmarker} and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and {disfmarker} and stuff comes in as
Turn 511, F (Grad): Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it .
Turn 512, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 513, F (Grad): Because , you know , I have my {pause} stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to .
Turn 514, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 515, F (Grad): And , uh {pause} So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Turn 516, C (PhD): Move them to the bottom .
Turn 517, B (Professor): So {disfmarker} so the only thing we 're missing is {disfmarker} is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something .
Turn 518, F (Grad): Yeah , right . So , i this is gonna mean {disfmarker}
Turn 519, C (PhD): Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom .
Turn 520, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 521, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 522, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 523, F (Grad): Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form
Turn 524, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 525, H (PhD): In {disfmarker}
Turn 526, A (Postdoc): And it also doesn't give a {disfmarker} a specific {disfmarker} I didn't think of it .
Turn 527, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 528, F (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 529, A (Postdoc): S I think it 's a good idea {disfmarker} an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite .
Turn 530, F (Grad): Yeah , release .
Turn 531, A (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint .
Turn 532, B (Professor): Yeah . It 's converging .
Turn 533, A (Postdoc): Yeah . That 's right .
Turn 534, H (PhD): This {disfmarker} um , I 've seen this recently . Uh , I got email , and it {disfmarker} i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the mail .
Turn 535, A (Postdoc): Oh , that 's interesting .
Turn 536, D (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 537, H (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 538, F (Grad): You {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker}
Turn 539, D (Grad): It 's like certified mail .
Turn 540, F (Grad): A lot of mailers support return receipt .
Turn 541, A (Postdoc): Could do that .
Turn 542, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 543, F (Grad): But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it .
Turn 544, H (PhD): No , no , no . This is different . This is not {disfmarker} So , I {disfmarker} I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to {disfmarker} to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox .
Turn 545, A (Postdoc): Mmm .
Turn 546, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 547, H (PhD): But {disfmarker} but , no . This was different . Ins - in the mail , there was a {disfmarker}
Turn 548, F (Grad): Oh , just a button .
Turn 549, H (PhD): uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail .
Turn 550, F (Grad): Oh , yeah . Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . But I hate that .
Turn 551, H (PhD): But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable {disfmarker} you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n
Turn 552, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 553, B (Professor): And {disfmarker}
Turn 554, E (PhD): You might as well just respond to the mail .
Turn 555, B (Professor): And we actually need a third thing .
Turn 556, E (PhD): I mean
Turn 557, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 558, B (Professor): It 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and agree with one of the possible actions .
Turn 559, H (PhD): No , no . You can do that .
Turn 560, B (Professor): Right ?
Turn 561, H (PhD): You know , you can put this button anywhere you want ,
Turn 562, B (Professor): Oh ? Oh , I see .
Turn 563, H (PhD): and you can put it the bottom of the message and say " here , by {disfmarker} you know , by clicking on this , I {disfmarker} I agree {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , you know , I acknowledge {disfmarker} "
Turn 564, B (Professor): That i i my first - born children are yours , and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 565, E (PhD): Quick question . Are , um {disfmarker}
Turn 566, F (Grad): Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and {pause} even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So .
Turn 567, A (Postdoc): But why shouldn't they just {pause} email back ? I don't see there 's a problem .
Turn 568, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 569, F (Grad): Yeah . Reply .
Turn 570, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 571, A (Postdoc): It 's very nice . I {disfmarker} I like the high - tech aspect of it ,
Turn 572, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 573, A (Postdoc): but I think {disfmarker}
Turn 574, H (PhD): No , no , no . {vocalsound} I actually don't .
Turn 575, A (Postdoc): I appreciate it .
Turn 576, H (PhD): I 'm just saying that
Turn 577, F (Grad): Well , I {disfmarker} cuz I use a text mail reader .
Turn 578, H (PhD): if ev but I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 579, E (PhD): Don't you use VI for your mai ?
Turn 580, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 581, B (Professor): Wow . That 's {disfmarker} that 's my guy . Alright .
Turn 582, F (Grad): You {disfmarker} you read email {pause} in VI ?
Turn 583, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 584, A (Postdoc): Yeah . {vocalsound} I like VI .
Turn 585, H (PhD): So {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} i There 's these logos {pause} that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like " powered by VI " .
Turn 586, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 587, B (Professor): Wow .
Turn 588, D (Grad): I see .
Turn 589, E (PhD): Anyway , quick question .
Turn 590, F (Grad): You could put wed bugs in the email .
Turn 591, E (PhD): How m
Turn 592, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 593, E (PhD): Like , there were three meetings this time , or so
Turn 594, A (Postdoc): Six .
Turn 595, E (PhD): or how many ? Six ? But , no of different people . So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} I mean , it also depends on how many {disfmarker} Like , if we release {disfmarker} this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? In th
Turn 596, F (Grad): Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails {pause} every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .
Turn 597, E (PhD): I don't know . Oh . Oh , OK . So this time was just the first chunk . OK .
Turn 598, F (Grad): So . Tha - that was my intention . It 's just {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} that we just happened to have a bunch all at once .
Turn 599, E (PhD): Well , that 's a good idea .
Turn 600, F (Grad): I mean , maybe {disfmarker} Is that {pause} the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ?
Turn 601, A (Postdoc): I agree with you . It 's {disfmarker} we could do it , uh {disfmarker} I I could {disfmarker} I 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise {disfmarker} What I was thinking {disfmarker} Uh , so this one {disfmarker} That was exactly right , that we had a {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . Don't have it . But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable .
Turn 602, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 603, A (Postdoc): People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . My , um {disfmarker} I was thinking that with the {pause} NSA meetings , I 'd like {disfmarker} there are three of them , and they 're {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I will have them done by Monday . Uh , unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , {vocalsound} you know , they 're {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have a {disfmarker} it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking , and it 's all in one chu But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available .
Turn 604, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 605, A (Postdoc): I could do it either way . I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .
Turn 606, B (Professor): We heard anything from IBM ? at all ?
Turn 607, C (PhD): Uh . Let 's see . We {disfmarker} Yeah , right . So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . Everything seemed fine . Adam {pause} had a script that will {pause} put everything back together and there was {disfmarker} Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . And then , um , {vocalsound} we , uh {disfmarker} I sent him a pointer to three more . And so he 's {pause} off and {pause} working on those .
Turn 608, F (Grad): Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .
Turn 609, A (Postdoc): That 's on my list .
Turn 610, F (Grad): So at some point we need to do that .
Turn 611, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 612, A (Postdoc): Well , that 's on my list .
Turn 613, C (PhD): Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process .
Turn 614, F (Grad): I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} that aren't in there . So .
Turn 615, A (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 616, B (Professor): But I think {disfmarker} Yeah . Like you said , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's gonna be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing , I would imagine ,
Turn 617, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 618, B (Professor): once {disfmarker} once we {disfmarker}
Turn 619, F (Grad): Yes , absolutely . Yeah .
Turn 620, A (Postdoc): One question about the backchannels .
Turn 621, B (Professor): It 's gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 622, A (Postdoc): Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ?
Turn 623, F (Grad): Yes , absolutely . Absolutely .
Turn 624, A (Postdoc): Oh , interesting . Oh , interesting . OK .
Turn 625, F (Grad): Yeah . They 're {disfmarker} they 're not in the segmented .
Turn 626, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 627, F (Grad): It 's not that the {pause} IBM people didn't do it .
Turn 628, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 629, F (Grad): Just they didn't get marked .
Turn 630, A (Postdoc): OK . So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} There 's another issue which is this {disfmarker} we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um {disfmarker} We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those {pause} six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's {disfmarker} Chuck 's , uh , put that in .
Turn 631, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the {vocalsound} web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . And , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with SCP .
Turn 632, E (PhD): Wait . So you put the reference files {disfmarker} ?
Turn 633, C (PhD): No , no . They d they wanted the audio .
Turn 634, E (PhD): Or the {disfmarker} ?
Turn 635, C (PhD): Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts .
Turn 636, E (PhD): No , I mean of the transcripts . Um . Well , we can talk about it off - line .
Turn 637, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 638, F (Grad): There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five .
Turn 639, H (PhD): D d So , does Washi - does {disfmarker} does UW wanna u do this {disfmarker} wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ?
Turn 640, C (PhD): Uh , for recognition .
Turn 641, E (PhD): I think they 're doing w
Turn 642, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 643, E (PhD): didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts
Turn 644, H (PhD): Oh . I see .
Turn 645, A (Postdoc): This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure .
Turn 646, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 647, E (PhD): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 648, A (Postdoc): Um @ @ {comment} So , this is from one of the NSA meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is {pause} what it was changed to . So , um . {vocalsound} And now the first one . " OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting . The last time , uh {disfmarker} " And the transcriber thought " little too much " But , {vocalsound} uh , really , um , it was " we learned too much " , which makes more sense syntactically as well .
Turn 649, H (PhD): And these {disfmarker} the parentheses were f from {disfmarker}
Turn 650, A (Postdoc): Then {disfmarker} Oh , this {disfmarker} that 's the convention for indicating uncertain .
Turn 651, F (Grad): U uncertains .
Turn 652, A (Postdoc): So the transcriber was right .
Turn 653, H (PhD): S
Turn 654, A (Postdoc): You know , she was uncertain about that .
Turn 655, H (PhD): OK .
Turn 656, A (Postdoc): So she 's right to be uncertain . And it 's also a g a good indication of the {disfmarker} of that .
Turn 657, H (PhD): Oh . {comment} OK .
Turn 658, A (Postdoc): The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia and {pause} she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . Uh , OK . Um , next one . Um . {vocalsound} This was {pause} an interesting one . So the original was " So that 's not {disfmarker} so Claudia 's not the bad master here " , and then he laughs , but it really " web master " .
Turn 659, F (Grad): Web master .
Turn 660, D (Grad): Oh . {comment} Uh - oh .
Turn 661, A (Postdoc): And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that . So instead of " split upon unknown " , {comment} it 's " split in principle " .
Turn 662, F (Grad): Yep .
Turn 663, D (Grad): Jane , these are from IBM ?
Turn 664, F (Grad): Spit upon ?
Turn 665, D (Grad): The top lines ?
Turn 666, A (Postdoc): No , no . These are {disfmarker} these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings .
Turn 667, F (Grad): No , these are {pause} ours .
Turn 668, A (Postdoc): The transcribers {disfmarker} transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version .
Turn 669, D (Grad): Oh . Oh , I see .
Turn 670, A (Postdoc): My {disfmarker} my checked version , after I go through it .
Turn 671, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 672, A (Postdoc): Um , then you get down here . Um . Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . That 's the next example , the next one . The , uh , version beyond this is {disfmarker} So instead of saying " or " , especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones . Those sneak in . Um , the next one {disfmarker}
Turn 673, F (Grad): That 's cool .
Turn 674, H (PhD): Discourse markers .
Turn 675, A (Postdoc): S
Turn 676, H (PhD): Discourse markers .
Turn 677, A (Postdoc): Sorry , what ? Discourse markers ? Sure . Sure , sure , sure .
Turn 678, H (PhD): Discourse markers .
Turn 679, A (Postdoc): And it 's {disfmarker} and it makes sense
Turn 680, H (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 681, A (Postdoc): cuz it 's , like , below this {disfmarker} it 's a little subliminal there .
Turn 682, H (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 683, A (Postdoc): Um . OK , the next one , uh , {vocalsound} this is a term . The problem with terminology . Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . But really it 's " QS in advance " . I mean , I {disfmarker} I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . OK , then you got , um , {vocalsound} uh , instead of " from something - or - other cards " , {comment} it 's " for multicast " . And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " . This was changed to an acronym initially and it should shouldn't have been . And then , you can see here " GPS " was misinterpreted . It 's just totally understanda This is {disfmarker} this is a lot of jargon . Um , and the final one , the transcriber had th " in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown " . And it {disfmarker} it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core " . Now this is a lot of {pause} terminology . And they 're generally extremely good ,
Turn 684, H (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 685, A (Postdoc): but , you know in this {disfmarker} this area it really does pay to , um {disfmarker} to double check and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the {disfmarker} you know , there 're a lot of these in there .
Turn 686, H (PhD): Yeah . So how often {disfmarker} ?
Turn 687, F (Grad): Yeah , but I bet {disfmarker} I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though .
Turn 688, A (Postdoc): No , actually no .
Turn 689, D (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 690, A (Postdoc): Huh - uh .
Turn 691, F (Grad): Oh , really ? Uh , it 's {disfmarker} Oh , so it 's just jargon .
Turn 692, A (Postdoc): It 's jargon . Yeah . I mean this is {disfmarker} cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing .
Turn 693, H (PhD): Well , but {disfmarker}
Turn 694, A (Postdoc): And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent .
Turn 695, H (PhD): But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} But we don't {disfmarker} I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . So ,
Turn 696, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 697, H (PhD): you know , un until you actually {pause} get a decent language model , @ @ {comment} Adam 's right .
Turn 698, F (Grad): It probably won't do any better .
Turn 699, H (PhD): You probably won't notice a difference . But it 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . I mean , {vocalsound} obviously .
Turn 700, A (Postdoc): Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval ,
Turn 701, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 702, A (Postdoc): cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , {vocalsound} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 703, F (Grad): Did I say that ?
Turn 704, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 705, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 706, B (Professor): Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because {pause} the {disfmarker} it 's not what I said " .
Turn 707, F (Grad): Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,
Turn 708, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 709, A (Postdoc): Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .
Turn 710, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 711, F (Grad): is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " ,
Turn 712, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 713, F (Grad): and I don't want them to do that .
Turn 714, A (Postdoc): And then I also {disfmarker} the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones
Turn 715, H (PhD): C
Turn 716, A (Postdoc): because of the problem of low gain in the originals . And {disfmarker} and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the {disfmarker} the choice . We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets
Turn 717, F (Grad): Yeah . Ugh !
Turn 718, A (Postdoc): but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this {disfmarker} with this respect to this particular task .
Turn 719, H (PhD): Well , return the old ones .
Turn 720, F (Grad): It 's probably impedance matching problems .
Turn 721, A (Postdoc): I don't know exactly ,
Turn 722, F (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 723, A (Postdoc): but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription .
Turn 724, B (Professor): Could be .
Turn 725, A (Postdoc): So it i we had every reason to think they would work .
Turn 726, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 727, H (PhD): So you have spare headsets ?
Turn 728, A (Postdoc): Sorry , what ?
Turn 729, H (PhD): You have spare headsets ?
Turn 730, F (Grad): They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones .
Turn 731, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 732, H (PhD): No , no . I mean , just earphones ? Um , because I , uh , I could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b go borrow it from someone and {disfmarker}
Turn 733, A (Postdoc): We have actua actually I have {disfmarker} W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work {pause} for a day , I was {disfmarker} I was hanging on to the others for , eh {disfmarker} for spares ,
Turn 734, H (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 735, A (Postdoc): but I can tell you what I recommend .
Turn 736, B (Professor): No , but you 'd {disfmarker} If you {disfmarker} Yeah , w we should get it .
Turn 737, H (PhD): Sure . No problem .
Turn 738, F (Grad): But if you need it , just get it .
Turn 739, H (PhD): I just {disfmarker}
Turn 740, F (Grad): Come on .
Turn 741, H (PhD): Right .
Turn 742, B (Professor): Yeah . If you need it .
Turn 743, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 744, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 745, A (Postdoc): It 'd just have to be a s a separate order {disfmarker} an added order .
Turn 746, D (Grad): Yeah , I still {disfmarker} I still need to get a pair , too .
Turn 747, B (Professor): They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're pretty inexpensive .
Turn 748, E (PhD): Yeah , that {disfmarker} We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually .
Turn 749, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 750, D (Grad): I 'm using one of these . Yeah .
Turn 751, E (PhD): We have {disfmarker}
Turn 752, H (PhD): I think I have a pair that I brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening
Turn 753, B (Professor): No . Just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just buy them .
Turn 754, E (PhD): Sh - Just get the model number
Turn 755, H (PhD): and it 's not {disfmarker} Nnn . Yeah .
Turn 756, B (Professor): Just buy them .
Turn 757, E (PhD): and {disfmarker} Where do you buy these from ?
Turn 758, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 759, A (Postdoc): Cambridge SoundWorks , just down the street .
Turn 760, E (PhD): Like {disfmarker} ? You just b go and b
Turn 761, A (Postdoc): Yeah . They always have them in stock .
Turn 762, E (PhD): Oh .
Turn 763, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 764, E (PhD): That 'd be a good idea .
Turn 765, H (PhD): Anyway .
Turn 766, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 767, F (Grad): W uh , could you email out the brand ?
Turn 768, A (Postdoc): Oh , sure . Yeah . OK .
Turn 769, F (Grad): Cuz I think {disfmarker} sounds like people are interested .
Turn 770, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 771, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 772, D (Grad): Definitely .
Turn 773, F (Grad): So .
Turn 774, A (Postdoc): It 's made a difference in {disfmarker} in how easy . Yeah .
Turn 775, B (Professor): I realized something I should talk about . So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ?
Turn 776, F (Grad): Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again .
Turn 777, D (Grad): Yeah . u It 's short . I mean , if you wanna go , we can just throw it in at the end .
Turn 778, B (Professor): No , no . Why don't you {disfmarker} why don't you go ahead since it 's short .
Turn 779, D (Grad): Um , well , uh .
Turn 780, F (Grad): Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . Yeah , we know disk space is short .
Turn 781, H (PhD): The disk space was short . Yeah . That 's what I thought too .
Turn 782, E (PhD): That 's a great ambiguity .
Turn 783, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 784, E (PhD): It 's one of these {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's social
Turn 785, B (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} I i i it i
Turn 786, E (PhD): and , uh , discourse level
Turn 787, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 788, E (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 789, B (Professor): Yeah , it 's great . Yeah ,
Turn 790, E (PhD): Sorry .
Turn 791, B (Professor): double {disfmarker} double {disfmarker}
Turn 792, F (Grad): Yeah , it was really goo
Turn 793, E (PhD): See , if I had that little {pause} scratch - pad , I would have made an X there .
Turn 794, D (Grad): Thank you , thank you .
Turn 795, F (Grad): Uh , well , we 'll give you one then .
Turn 796, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 797, D (Grad): Um . {vocalsound} So , um , without thinking about it , when I offered up my hard drive last week {disfmarker}
Turn 798, F (Grad): Oh , no .
Turn 799, D (Grad): Um , this is always a suspect phrase .
Turn 800, E (PhD): It was while I was out of town .
Turn 801, D (Grad): But , um , no . I , uh {disfmarker} I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , {vocalsound} o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gonna need a lot more {disfmarker} We 're probably gonna need {vocalsound} that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . But , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gonna help us out with some stuff .
Turn 802, B (Professor): We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes .
Turn 803, D (Grad): So {disfmarker} OK . We just need to {disfmarker}
Turn 804, E (PhD): I think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk {pause} to be safe .
Turn 805, B (Professor): Well , we 're getting three thirty {disfmarker} thirty - sixes .
Turn 806, E (PhD): So .
Turn 807, B (Professor): Right ?
Turn 808, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 809, B (Professor): That are going into the main f file server .
Turn 810, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 811, B (Professor): So .
Turn 812, C (PhD): Markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon .
Turn 813, D (Grad): W Well . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Turn 814, F (Grad): Soon ?
Turn 815, D (Grad): Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like , {vocalsound} the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer .
Turn 816, H (PhD): Oh , so {disfmarker} so , you mean the d the internal {disfmarker} the disks on the machines that we just got ?
Turn 817, D (Grad): Whew . Or we can move them .
Turn 818, F (Grad): No .
Turn 819, C (PhD): These are gonna go onto Abbott .
Turn 820, F (Grad): Ne - new disks .
Turn 821, H (PhD): Or extra disk ?
Turn 822, B (Professor): Onto Abbott , the file server .
Turn 823, D (Grad): So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ?
Turn 824, F (Grad): On {disfmarker}
Turn 825, H (PhD): Oh , oh . OK .
Turn 826, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 827, E (PhD): Uh , i
Turn 828, F (Grad): Once they come in . Sure .
Turn 829, D (Grad): OK . That 's fine .
Turn 830, E (PhD): Do {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when is this planned for {pause} roughly ?
Turn 831, C (PhD): They should be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I imagine next week or something .
Turn 832, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 833, E (PhD): OK . So {disfmarker}
Turn 834, F (Grad): If you 're {disfmarker} if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive .
Turn 835, D (Grad): I think if I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 836, F (Grad): But I {disfmarker} I vacillate between no space free and {pause} a few gig free .
Turn 837, D (Grad): Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate
Turn 838, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 839, F (Grad): So .
Turn 840, D (Grad): and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out .
Turn 841, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 842, D (Grad): That was the only thing I wanted to bring up .
Turn 843, C (PhD): It should be soon . We {disfmarker} we should {disfmarker}
Turn 844, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 845, B (Professor): So there 's another hundred gig . So .
Turn 846, D (Grad): Alright . Great .
Turn 847, H (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 848, B (Professor): OK . It 's great to be able to do it ,
Turn 849, D (Grad): That 's it .
Turn 850, B (Professor): just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig ,
Turn 851, E (PhD): Good .
Turn 852, B (Professor): no big deal " .
Turn 853, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 854, F (Grad): Yeah . A hundred gig here , a hundred gig there .
Turn 855, E (PhD): Well , each meeting is like a gig or something ,
Turn 856, F (Grad): It 's eventually real disk space .
Turn 857, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 858, E (PhD): so it 's really {disfmarker}
Turn 859, B (Professor): Yeah . Um . Yeah . I was just going to comment that I I 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with Mari tomorrow , late afternoon .
Turn 860, F (Grad): Oh , yeah .
Turn 861, B (Professor): We 're supposed to {vocalsound} get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , I never actually {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was asking about this . I don't really quite understand this . She was re she was referring to it as {disfmarker} I think this actually {pause} didn't just come from her , but this is {pause} what , uh , DARPA had asked for . Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . But of course the fiscal year starts in October , so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .
Turn 862, C (PhD): She 's either really late or really early .
Turn 863, F (Grad): Huh . Or she 's getting a good early start .
Turn 864, B (Professor): Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . It 's that the meeting is in July so they {disfmarker} so DARPA just said do an annual report . So . So . So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , just by looking at {disfmarker} at papers and status reports . I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful .
Turn 865, H (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 866, B (Professor): Uh , so I can grab stuff there . And if , uh {disfmarker} if I have some questions I 'll {disfmarker}
Turn 867, F (Grad): When we remember to fill them out .
Turn 868, B (Professor): Yeah . If {pause} people could do it as soon as {disfmarker} as you can , if you haven't done one si recently . Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , but , you know , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure before {pause} it 's all done , I 'll end up bugging people for {disfmarker} for more clarification about stuff . Um . {vocalsound} But , um , I don't know , I guess {disfmarker} I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing . We have these meetings and {disfmarker} and there 's the status reports . Uh . But , um . Um . Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something {vocalsound} hasn't , uh {disfmarker} I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on {vocalsound} this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation .
Turn 869, H (PhD): OK .
Turn 870, B (Professor): Uh . I guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the {pause} demos and all that , probably .
Turn 871, F (Grad): Yep . And Don is {pause} gonna be helping out with that .
Turn 872, B (Professor): Oh , that 's right .
Turn 873, F (Grad): So .
Turn 874, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 875, F (Grad): Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ?
Turn 876, D (Grad): Um .
Turn 877, F (Grad): Not here , but later today ?
Turn 878, D (Grad): We should probably talk off - line about when we 're gonna talk off - line .
Turn 879, F (Grad): OK . OK .
Turn 880, B (Professor): OK . Yeah , I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz , um , I 'm actually gonna have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a few days off the following week , a after the {disfmarker} after the picnic . So .
Turn 881, F (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 882, B (Professor): That 's all I had .
Turn 883, F (Grad): So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription {disfmarker} automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . So .
Turn 884, E (PhD): How long does it take you to save the data ?
Turn 885, F (Grad): Fifteen minutes .
Turn 886, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 887, F (Grad): So . If you wanna do a quick
Turn 888, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 889, F (Grad): ten minute {disfmarker}
Turn 890, E (PhD): Guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest .
Turn 891, B (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 892, E (PhD): We {disfmarker} we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record .
Turn 893, B (Professor): And there 's the digits to do .
Turn 894, E (PhD): So .
Turn 895, B (Professor): So maybe {disfmarker} may maybe {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker}
Turn 896, F (Grad): Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits .
Turn 897, B (Professor): We could . Fi - five minute report or something .
Turn 898, E (PhD): It 's up to you . I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 899, B (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 900, F (Grad): Whatever you want .
Turn 901, B (Professor): Well , I would love to hear about it ,
Turn 902, F (Grad): What do you have to say ?
Turn 903, B (Professor): especially since {disfmarker}
Turn 904, F (Grad): I 'm interested , so {disfmarker}
Turn 905, B (Professor): Yeah . Well , I 'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow , so this is just a {pause} good example of {pause} the sort of thing I 'd like to {pause} hear about .
Turn 906, E (PhD): Wait . Why is everybody looking at me ?
Turn 907, C (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 908, F (Grad): Sorry .
Turn 909, B (Professor): Cuz he looked at you
Turn 910, H (PhD): What ?
Turn 911, B (Professor): and says you 're sketching .
Turn 912, E (PhD): Uh . I 'm not sure what you were referring to .
Turn 913, H (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} actually , I 'm not sure what {disfmarker} ? Are we supposed to have done something ?
Turn 914, F (Grad): No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting .
Turn 915, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 916, E (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 917, F (Grad): And this week we were gonna try to do {pause} t automatic transcription {pause} status .
Turn 918, H (PhD): Alternating .
Turn 919, E (PhD): I wasn't here last week . Sorry .
Turn 920, H (PhD): Oh !
Turn 921, E (PhD): Oh .
Turn 922, F (Grad): But we sort of failed .
Turn 923, H (PhD): We did that last week . Right ?
Turn 924, E (PhD): Hhh .
Turn 925, F (Grad): No .
Turn 926, B (Professor): I thought we did .
Turn 927, F (Grad): Did we ? OK .
Turn 928, H (PhD): Yeah . We did .
Turn 929, F (Grad): OK . So now {disfmarker} now we have the schedule . So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely .
Turn 930, H (PhD): OK .
Turn 931, E (PhD): Oh . OK .
Turn 932, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 933, B (Professor): OK . Whew !
Turn 934, C (PhD): Good update .
Turn 935, F (Grad): Whew !
Turn 936, B (Professor): That was {disfmarker}
Turn 937, F (Grad): Dodged that bullet .
Turn 938, B (Professor): Yeah . Nicely done , Liz .
Turn 939, A (Postdoc): A woman of few words .
Turn 940, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} but lots of prosody . OK . {vocalsound} OK .
Turn 941, F (Grad): Th
Turn 942, H (PhD): Uh , I mean , we {disfmarker} we really haven't done anything .
Turn 943, F (Grad): Excuse me ?
Turn 944, H (PhD): Sorry .
Turn 945, A (Postdoc): Well , since last week .
Turn 946, E (PhD): Yeah , we 're {disfmarker}
Turn 947, H (PhD): I mean , the {disfmarker} the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the automatic alignments because , uh , I got some {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech {disfmarker} or , of the foreground speech with background speech .
Turn 948, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 949, H (PhD): So .
Turn 950, E (PhD): And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process {disfmarker}
Turn 951, H (PhD): But , we haven't actually {disfmarker}
Turn 952, E (PhD): the , um {disfmarker} when he can get these {disfmarker} You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems
Turn 953, H (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 954, E (PhD): because you have timed sp at {disfmarker} on either side .
Turn 955, F (Grad): Oh . Right , right . Mm - hmm .
Turn 956, E (PhD): And so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step .
Turn 957, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 958, A (Postdoc): I 'll be interested .
Turn 959, E (PhD): We did get our , um {disfmarker} I guess , good news . We got our abstract accepted for this conference , um {disfmarker} workshop , ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey . And we sent in a very poor abstract , but they {disfmarker} very poor , very quick . Um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting {disfmarker}
Turn 960, F (Grad): When 's it due ?
Turn 961, E (PhD): The t paper isn't due until August . The abstracts were already due . So it 's that kind of workshop .
Turn 962, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 963, E (PhD): But , I mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody {disfmarker} sort of a different crowd , and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting .
Turn 964, A (Postdoc): What 's the name of the meeting ?
Turn 965, E (PhD): Uh , it 's ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding , or something like that {disfmarker}
Turn 966, H (PhD): It 's called Prosody to {disfmarker}
Turn 967, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 968, A (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 969, E (PhD): some generic {disfmarker} Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a {disfmarker} um , a web page for it .
Turn 970, B (Professor): Y you going to , uh , Eurospeech ? Yeah .
Turn 971, F (Grad): I don't have a paper
Turn 972, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 973, F (Grad): but I 'd kinda like to go , if I could . Is that alright ?
Turn 974, B (Professor): We 'll discuss it .
Turn 975, F (Grad): OK . {vocalsound} I guess that 's " no " .
Turn 976, B (Professor): My {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my car {disfmarker} my car needs a good wash , by the way .
Turn 977, F (Grad): OK . Well , that th Hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me .
Turn 978, B (Professor): Um .
Turn 979, F (Grad): I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . Should we do digits ?
Turn 980, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 981, F (Grad): Uh .
Turn 982, H (PhD): Can I go next ? Because I have to leave , actually .
Turn 983, F (Grad): Yep . Go for it . Hmm ! Thanks . Thank you .
Turn 984, B (Professor): So you get to be the one who has all the paper rustling . Right ?
