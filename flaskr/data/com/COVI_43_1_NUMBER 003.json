As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve.\n              \n              Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history.\n              \n              At this very moment, the Dominion Carillonneur, Dr. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries.\n              Today's meeting is taking place by video conference. The proceedings will be made available via the House of Commons website. Please be aware that the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee.\n              \n              Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings.\n              \n              In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules.\n              \n              Interpretation of this video conference will be done as it is at normal committee meetings and in the House.

As you have seen, I change as I am speaking.\n              \n              I have now switched over to English in order to speak English.

That was where we had a little bit of a glitch in the last session.\n              I understand that there are no statements by ministers. \n              We can now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.\n              \n              \n              I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.\n              \n               In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. on the day before the committee.\n              I thank all the members for their usual co-operation.\n              \n              Thank you all.\n              \n              Now we'll proceed to presenting petitions.\n              Our first petition comes from the honourable member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, Mr. Genuis."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "261646", "name": "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, CPC)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions today.\n              The first petition is with respect to government Bill C-7. Petitioners raised concerns that this bill removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. This would require that bill to be amended or not passed.\n              The second petition is with respect to Senate public bill S-204. This is on organ harvesting and trafficking. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking.

They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16.

It documented his journey across Canada. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. Myles asked me how he could help raise awareness of that issue. I mentioned to him e-petitions online and getting people across the country to sign them. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program.\n              I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system.

Problematic substance use is a health issue and is not resolved through criminalization of personal possession and consumption. \n              They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "261843", "name": "Mr. Brad Vis (Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon, CPC)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. \n              The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term “military-style assault rifles” is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities.\n              The petitioners in Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Very good.

Now we are learning that, because of the pandemic, some releases are happening very quickly.

I hope that you can still hear me properly.\n              For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Québécois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25 per week, or $110 per month. By the way, I hate the term \"old age security”. I prefer \"senior security”. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. We are asking for it to be done at this point, at least temporarily.\n              Parliament stopped sitting in the middle of March. We are now in May, and seniors still have nothing.

We have also reduced by 25% the minimum amount that must be withdrawn from registered retirement income funds. We have also channelled $9 million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors.\n              Absolutely, I recognize that more must be done.

It's true for all seniors over 65 years old, of course. The current old age pension represents less than half of the Canada emergency student benefit. It represents less than one third of the basic Canada emergency response benefit.\n              Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338 constituencies, are asking what we are doing.

We're already starting to see the results.\n              As I was saying, I established an expert advisory committee to advise us. We've also been working on tightening the rules of the voluntary disclosures program. We've entered into country-by-country agreements that make it possible to share information. We're auditing four countries a year. We're working with the OECD.

As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account.
