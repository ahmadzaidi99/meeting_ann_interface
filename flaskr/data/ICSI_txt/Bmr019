Turn 0, E (Grad): OK , we 're on .
Turn 1, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 2, E (Grad): So , I mean , everyone who 's on the wireless check that they 're on .
Turn 3, F (PhD): C we {disfmarker}
Turn 4, G (Grad): Alright .
Turn 5, C (Postdoc): I see . Yeah .
Turn 6, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 7, E (Grad): OK , our agenda was quite short .
Turn 8, B (Professor): Oh , could you {pause} close the door , maybe ? Yeah .
Turn 9, E (Grad): Sure . Two items , which was , uh , digits and possibly stuff on {disfmarker} on , uh , forced alignment , which Jane said that Liz and Andreas had in information on ,
Turn 10, B (Professor): 
Turn 11, E (Grad): but they didn't ,
Turn 12, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 13, B (Professor): I guess the only other thing , uh , for which I {disfmarker}
Turn 14, E (Grad): so .
Turn 15, F (PhD): We should do that second , because Liz might join us in time for that .
Turn 16, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 17, B (Professor): Um . OK , so there 's digits , alignments , and , um , I guess the other thing , {vocalsound} which I came unprepared for , uh , {vocalsound} is , uh , to dis s s see if there 's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting .
Turn 18, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 19, B (Professor): So . Any {disfmarker} I mean , maybe not .
Turn 20, E (Grad): Digits and alignments . But {disfmarker}
Turn 21, B (Professor): Uh .
Turn 22, F (PhD): Talk about aligning people 's schedules .
Turn 23, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 24, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 25, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 26, B (Professor): Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} Right . Yeah , I mean , it was {disfmarker}
Turn 27, E (Grad): Yeah , it 's forced alignment of people 's schedules .
Turn 28, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 29, D (PhD): Forced align .
Turn 30, F (PhD): If we 're very {disfmarker}
Turn 31, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 32, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 33, B (Professor): With {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} whatever it was , a month and a half or something ahead of time , the only time we could find in common {disfmarker} roughly in common , was on a Saturday .
Turn 34, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 35, B (Professor): Ugh .
Turn 36, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 37, F (PhD): It 's pretty sad .
Turn 38, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 39, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 40, C (Postdoc): Have {disfmarker} Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in more of the meeting ? I {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know , if we had the {disfmarker} if we had the telephone on the table {disfmarker}
Turn 41, B (Professor): No . But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something .
Turn 42, F (PhD): No , actually I {disfmarker} I have to {disfmarker} I have to shuttle {pause} kids from various places to various other places .
Turn 43, B (Professor): Right ?
Turn 44, C (Postdoc): I see . OK .
Turn 45, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 46, F (PhD): So . And I don't have {disfmarker} and I don't , um , have a cell phone
Turn 47, D (PhD): A cell phone ?
Turn 48, F (PhD): so I can't be having a conference call while driving .
Turn 49, B (Professor): R r right .
Turn 50, C (Postdoc): No . {comment} It 's not good .
Turn 51, B (Professor): So we have to {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Turn 52, C (Postdoc): That 's not good .
Turn 53, F (PhD): Plus , it would make for interesting noise {disfmarker} background noise .
Turn 54, B (Professor): 
Turn 55, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 56, F (PhD): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 57, B (Professor): So we have to equip him with a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with a head - mounted , uh , cell phone
Turn 58, E (Grad): Ye - we and we 'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits ,
Turn 59, B (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 60, E (Grad): so it could get real {disfmarker} {vocalsound} real car noise .
Turn 61, F (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 62, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 63, F (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 64, G (Grad): Take advantage .
Turn 65, D (PhD): And with the kids in the background .
Turn 66, F (PhD): I 'll let {disfmarker} I 'd let {disfmarker}
Turn 67, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 68, F (PhD): I let , uh , my five - year - old have a try at the digits , eh .
Turn 69, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 70, E (Grad): So , anyway , I can talk about digits . Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ? I mean that it was basically {disfmarker} the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i it shouldn't have been as surprising as I {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I felt it was . The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling {pause} if no one else is talking .
Turn 71, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 72, F (PhD): Exactly .
Turn 73, E (Grad): Um , so , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 74, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 75, B (Professor): Well , it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , sort of the bre the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that , the lapel 's gonna be better on .
Turn 76, G (Grad): It 's g it {disfmarker}
Turn 77, D (PhD): Or the cross - talk . Yeah .
Turn 78, B (Professor): The lapel is typically worse on the {disfmarker} on clothes rustling , but if no one 's rustling their clothes ,
Turn 79, E (Grad): Right . I mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits ,
Turn 80, B (Professor): it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 81, E (Grad): so it 's {disfmarker} it 's a very different task than sort of the natural .
Turn 82, D (PhD): Yeah . You don't move much during reading digits , I think .
Turn 83, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 84, E (Grad): So .
Turn 85, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 86, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 87, G (Grad): Probably the fact that it picks up other people 's speakers {disfmarker} other people 's talking is an indication of that it {disfmarker} the fact it is a good microphone .
Turn 88, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 89, B (Professor): Right . So in the digits , in most {disfmarker} most cases , there weren't other people talking .
Turn 90, E (Grad): Right . Right .
Turn 91, G (Grad): So .
Turn 92, B (Professor): So .
Turn 93, F (PhD): D do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them ?
Turn 94, B (Professor): There typically don't , no .
Turn 95, F (PhD): Because I {disfmarker} I suppose you could make some that have sort of {disfmarker} that you have to orient towards your mouth ,
Turn 96, E (Grad): They have a little bit ,
Turn 97, F (PhD): and then it would {disfmarker}
Turn 98, E (Grad): but they 're not noise - cancelling . So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 99, B (Professor): They 're {disfmarker} they 're intended to be omni - directional .
Turn 100, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 101, B (Professor): And th it 's {disfmarker} and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on , you know .
Turn 102, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 103, E (Grad): Right . So , also , Andreas , on that one the {disfmarker} the back part of it should be right against your head . And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much .
Turn 104, F (PhD): It is against my head .
Turn 105, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 106, B (Professor): Yeah . Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too . Much the same thing ,
Turn 107, E (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 108, B (Professor): and {disfmarker} and it was {disfmarker} uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker} the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know , {pause} all the participants in Aurora , {vocalsound} was so much worse {vocalsound} than the {disfmarker} than the S R
Turn 109, E (Grad): Everybody .
Turn 110, B (Professor): And the interesting thing is that even though , {vocalsound} yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , {vocalsound} it 's just not as good as having a {disfmarker} a l very large amount of data and training up a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a nice good big {vocalsound} HMM . Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this . Um . So . Um .
Turn 111, F (PhD): And we know {disfmarker} Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ?
Turn 112, E (Grad): No .
Turn 113, B (Professor): I s I think Stephane , uh , had seen them .
Turn 114, E (Grad): Or if you did , I didn't include them , cuz it was {disfmarker}
Turn 115, B (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 116, F (PhD): Yeah , I think I did , actually . So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation .
Turn 117, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 118, F (PhD): Um . A {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple percent or some I mean {disfmarker} Well , I don't know it {disfmarker} Overall {disfmarker} Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't remember , but there was {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} there was a significant , um , loss or win {comment} from adaptation {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with adaptation . And , um , that was the phone - loop adaptation . And then there was a very small {disfmarker} like point one percent on the natives {disfmarker} uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to {pause} the recognition hypotheses . And {pause} I tried both means adaptation and means and variances , and the variances added another {disfmarker} or subtracted another point one percent . So , {vocalsound} it 's , um {disfmarker} that 's the number there . Point six , I believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .
Turn 119, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 120, B (Professor): But I think one thing is that , uh , I would presume {disfmarker} Hav - Have you ever t {vocalsound} Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual TI - digits test set ?
Turn 121, F (PhD): This exact same recognizer ? No .
Turn 122, B (Professor): It might be interesting to do that . Cuz my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} cuz my sense , um {disfmarker}
Turn 123, F (PhD): But {disfmarker} but , I have {disfmarker} I mean , people {disfmarker} people at SRI are actually working on digits .
Turn 124, E (Grad): I bet it would do even slightly better .
Turn 125, F (PhD): I could {disfmarker} and they are using a system that 's , um {disfmarker} you know , h is actually trained on digits , um , but h h otherwise uses the same , you know , decoder , the same , uh , training methods , and so forth ,
Turn 126, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 127, F (PhD): and I could ask them what they get {pause} on TI - digits .
Turn 128, B (Professor): Yeah , bu although I 'd be {disfmarker} I think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable
Turn 129, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 130, B (Professor): and try it out on TI - digits .
Turn 131, F (PhD): Well , Adam knows how to run it ,
Turn 132, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 133, E (Grad): Yeah . No problem .
Turn 134, F (PhD): so you just make a f
Turn 135, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . Cuz our sense from the other {disfmarker} from the Aurora , uh , task is that {disfmarker}
Turn 136, E (Grad): And try it with TI - digits ?
Turn 137, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 138, B (Professor): I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent {vocalsound} numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing .
Turn 139, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 140, B (Professor): So , {vocalsound} one {disfmarker} so there were a number of things we noted from this .
Turn 141, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 142, B (Professor): One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK {disfmarker}
Turn 143, F (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 144, B (Professor): this , you know , very limited training HTK system .
Turn 145, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 146, B (Professor): Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits {vocalsound} recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the {pause} studio - recording TI - digits . I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still {disfmarker} even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .
Turn 147, F (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 148, B (Professor): And another might be that , uh , I 'd {disfmarker} I would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little {disfmarker} that they didn't include it ,
Turn 149, E (Grad): They didn't include it .
Turn 150, B (Professor): they made them do it again .
Turn 151, E (Grad): Whereas , I took out {pause} the ones that I noticed that were blatant {disfmarker} that were correctable .
Turn 152, B (Professor): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 153, E (Grad): So that , if someone just read the wrong digit , I corrected it .
Turn 154, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 155, E (Grad): And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether {disfmarker} I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six . And I asked him and he couldn't tell either .
Turn 156, I (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 157, E (Grad): So I just cut it out .
Turn 158, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 159, E (Grad): You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . Um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as TI - digits . So my expectations is TI - digits would , especially {disfmarker} I think TI - digits is all {pause} American English .
Turn 160, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 161, E (Grad): Right ? So it would probably do even a little better still on the SRI system , but we could give it a try .
Turn 162, F (PhD): Well . But {pause} remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh {disfmarker} on this SRI system , so , {vocalsound} um , I was {disfmarker} I thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing because it {disfmarker} it gets rid of some of the {disfmarker} uh , the noises , um , you know , in the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} below and above the {disfmarker} um , the , you know , speech bandwidth
Turn 163, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 164, F (PhD): and , um , I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data . And of course we can't do that or {disfmarker}
Turn 165, E (Grad): Wha - what 's TI - digits ? I thought t
Turn 166, B (Professor): It 's wide - band , yeah . It 's {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in fact , we looked it up
Turn 167, E (Grad): It is wide - band . OK .
Turn 168, B (Professor): and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .
Turn 169, E (Grad): Oh , that 's right . I {disfmarker} I did look that up .
Turn 170, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 171, E (Grad): I couldn't remember whether that was TI - digits or one of the other digit tasks .
Turn 172, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 173, F (PhD): Right . But {disfmarker} but , I would {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's easy enough to try , just run it on {disfmarker}
Turn 174, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 175, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 176, B (Professor): See w
Turn 177, E (Grad): So , Morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise .
Turn 178, F (PhD): Now , eh , does {disfmarker}
Turn 179, E (Grad): You might wanna move the mike down a little bit .
Turn 180, F (PhD): one {disfmarker} one issue {disfmarker} one issue with {disfmarker} with that is that {vocalsound} um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to {disfmarker} which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization and also in the VTL {pause} estimation .
Turn 181, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 182, F (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 183, E (Grad): Yeah , I noticed the script that extracted it .
Turn 184, F (PhD): Do y ? Is {disfmarker} ? So does {disfmarker} so th so does {disfmarker} does , um , {vocalsound} the TI - digits database have speakers that are known ?
Turn 185, E (Grad): Yep . Yep .
Turn 186, F (PhD): And is there {disfmarker} is there enough data or a comparable {disfmarker} comparable amount of data to {disfmarker} to what we have in our recordings here ?
Turn 187, E (Grad): That I don't know . I don't know . I don't know how many speakers there are ,
Turn 188, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 189, E (Grad): and {disfmarker} and how many speakers per utterance .
Turn 190, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 191, B (Professor): Well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation . That would {disfmarker}
Turn 192, F (PhD): Right . Uh , but I 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than {disfmarker} than the , um , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} the , uh , VTL estimation .
Turn 193, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 194, F (PhD): If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the {disfmarker} the warping , uh , factor . So , um {disfmarker}
Turn 195, E (Grad): I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do . So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 196, F (PhD): Right . But it 's not the amount of speakers , it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .
Turn 197, E (Grad): Right . So we {disfmarker} we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent .
Turn 198, F (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 199, E (Grad): Um .
Turn 200, F (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 201, E (Grad): So , although I {disfmarker} I sort of know how to run it , there are a little {disfmarker} a f few details here and there that I 'll have to {pause} dig out .
Turn 202, F (PhD): OK . The key {disfmarker} So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names .
Turn 203, E (Grad): Right . I saw that .
Turn 204, F (PhD): And there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a script {disfmarker} and that is actually all in one script . So there 's this one script that parses waveform names and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , ID or something that can stand in as a speaker ID . So , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , {vocalsound} um , in the {disfmarker} in the , uh , um , {vocalsound} TI - digits {pause} database .
Turn 205, E (Grad): Right . Right . And that , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 206, F (PhD): Or you can fake {disfmarker} you can fake {pause} names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the {disfmarker} for the meetings .
Turn 207, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 208, F (PhD): That would be the , sort of {disfmarker} probably the safest way to do {disfmarker}
Turn 209, E (Grad): I might have to do that anyway to {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker} because we may have to do an extract to get the {pause} amount of data per speaker about right .
Turn 210, F (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 211, E (Grad): The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ?
Turn 212, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 213, E (Grad): Or is that another one ? I 'm {disfmarker} I looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora , and now they 're all blurring .
Turn 214, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 215, E (Grad): Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . And then others were connected digits .
Turn 216, B (Professor): Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think .
Turn 217, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 218, B (Professor): The {disfmarker} I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using . It was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} that was isolated digits .
Turn 219, E (Grad): Maybe it 's the Bell Gram . Bell Digits . Alright .
Turn 220, B (Professor): Um .
Turn 221, F (PhD): By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them {vocalsound} by , um , {vocalsound} not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .
Turn 222, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 223, F (PhD): Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise . And that should really improve things , um , further . And then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted {disfmarker}
Turn 224, E (Grad): Channel adapted .
Turn 225, F (PhD): use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .
Turn 226, B (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} But the thing is , uh {disfmarker} I mean , w when you {disfmarker} it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a starter task for {disfmarker} you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits . And I {disfmarker} I think the answer is both . And for {disfmarker} for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation
Turn 227, F (PhD): Well , I don't know .
Turn 228, B (Professor): because {vocalsound} somebody {pause} gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it . You don't {disfmarker} don't , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 229, C (Postdoc): This is {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} that one 's better .
Turn 230, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 231, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 232, F (PhD): Um , but , you know , I {disfmarker} uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem , I mean . So , you want to {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} That 's the obvious thing to try .
Turn 233, C (Postdoc): Oh . Oh .
Turn 234, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 235, F (PhD): Right ? Then , eh {disfmarker} because you {disfmarker} you don't have any {disfmarker}
Turn 236, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 237, F (PhD): That 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the {disfmarker} the r the set up here .
Turn 238, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 239, F (PhD): So .
Turn 240, B (Professor): Yeah . So that 'd be anoth another interesting data point .
Turn 241, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 242, B (Professor): I mean , I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm saying I don't know if we 'd want to do that as the {disfmarker} as {disfmarker}
Turn 243, D (PhD): Other way .
Turn 244, E (Grad): Other way . Liz {disfmarker}
Turn 245, A (PhD): Now you 're all watching me .
Turn 246, E (Grad): It f it clips over your ears .
Turn 247, A (PhD): Alright . This way .
Turn 248, E (Grad): There you go .
Turn 249, C (Postdoc): If you have a strong fe if you have a strong preference , you could use this .
Turn 250, A (PhD): You 're all watching . This is terrible .
Turn 251, C (Postdoc): It 's just we {disfmarker} we think it has some spikes . So , uh , we {disfmarker} we didn't use that one .
Turn 252, A (PhD): I 'll get it .
Turn 253, C (Postdoc): But you could if you want .
Turn 254, B (Professor): Yeah . At any rate , I don't know if w
Turn 255, C (Postdoc): I don't know . And Andre - Andreas , your {disfmarker} your microphone 's a little bit low .
Turn 256, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 257, F (PhD): It is ?
Turn 258, B (Professor): I don't know if we wanna use that as the {disfmarker}
Turn 259, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 260, E (Grad): Uh , it pivots .
Turn 261, F (PhD): Uh .
Turn 262, C (Postdoc): So if you see the picture
Turn 263, E (Grad): It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} like this .
Turn 264, F (PhD): I I {disfmarker}
Turn 265, C (Postdoc): and then you have to scr
Turn 266, F (PhD): I {disfmarker} I already adjusted this a number of times .
Turn 267, E (Grad): Eh .
Turn 268, F (PhD): I {disfmarker} I
Turn 269, E (Grad): Yeah , I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like .
Turn 270, F (PhD): can't quite seem to {disfmarker} Yeah , I think this contraption around your head is not {pause} working so well .
Turn 271, B (Professor): Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah . Anyway , what I was saying is that I {disfmarker} I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to .
Turn 272, C (Postdoc): That looks good . Yeah .
Turn 273, B (Professor): To , uh , the {disfmarker} to have {disfmarker} have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation . But I think it 's an important data point , if you 're {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 274, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 275, B (Professor): Um . The other thing that {disfmarker} that , uh {disfmarker} of course , what Barry was looking at was {disfmarker} was just that , the near versus far . And , yeah , the adaptation would get {vocalsound} th some of that .
Turn 276, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 277, B (Professor): But , I think even {disfmarker} even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like I was saying in the email , I think that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's a big factor . So {disfmarker}
Turn 278, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 279, B (Professor): N
Turn 280, E (Grad): Liz , you could also just use the other mike if you 're having problems with that one .
Turn 281, C (Postdoc): Well .
Turn 282, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 283, C (Postdoc): Yeah . This would be OK . We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we think that this has spikes on it ,
Turn 284, A (PhD): It 's this thing 's {disfmarker} This is too big for my head .
Turn 285, C (Postdoc): so it 's not as good acoustically ,
Turn 286, F (PhD): Yeah , basically your ears are too big .
Turn 287, C (Postdoc): but {disfmarker}
Turn 288, F (PhD): I mean , mine are too . E th everybody 's ears are too big for these things .
Turn 289, A (PhD): No , my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} But this is too big for my head . So , I mean , {comment} {comment} it doesn't {disfmarker} you know , it 's sit
Turn 290, F (PhD): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 291, C (Postdoc): Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 292, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 293, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 294, E (Grad): Oh , well .
Turn 295, B (Professor): It 's {pause} great .
Turn 296, E (Grad): So the {disfmarker} To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this .
Turn 297, A (PhD): No this way . Yeah .
Turn 298, E (Grad): Yeah . There you go .
Turn 299, C (Postdoc): And there 's a screw that you can tighten .
Turn 300, E (Grad): And then it {disfmarker}
Turn 301, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 302, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 303, A (PhD): I already {pause} tried to get it close .
Turn 304, C (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 305, E (Grad): So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement .
Turn 306, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 307, C (Postdoc): That looks good .
Turn 308, E (Grad): But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot .
Turn 309, B (Professor): So , where were we ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .
Turn 310, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 311, E (Grad): Digits . Adaptation .
Turn 312, B (Professor): Uh , adaptation , non - adaptation , um , factor of two , um {disfmarker} Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w
Turn 313, F (PhD): What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you {disfmarker} ?
Turn 314, B (Professor): Oh , no , no .
Turn 315, F (PhD): I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 316, B (Professor): It 's tha that {disfmarker} that we were saying , you know , well is {disfmarker} how much worse is far than near , you know .
Turn 317, F (PhD): Oh , th OK .
Turn 318, B (Professor): And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at ,
Turn 319, F (PhD): That factor of two .
Turn 320, B (Professor): but for the everybody , it 's {vocalsound} little under a factor or two .
Turn 321, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 322, B (Professor): Yeah . I {disfmarker} I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the {disfmarker} the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone , at least from the good one .
Turn 323, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 324, B (Professor): I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something , but if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if , uh {disfmarker} if we 're getting thirty - five , forty percent or something , {vocalsound} u um {disfmarker}
Turn 325, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 326, A (PhD): Actually if you run , though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error .
Turn 327, B (Professor): Mm - hmm . Right . I understand . But doing the same kind of limited thing {disfmarker}
Turn 328, A (PhD): Or {disfmarker} or some high number .
Turn 329, B (Professor): Yeah , sure . Get all these insertions . But I 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing {vocalsound} as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as {disfmarker} a
Turn 330, A (PhD): Yeah . Where you know who the speaker is and there 's no overlap ? And you do just the far - field for those regions ?
Turn 331, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from . Right ?
Turn 332, E (Grad): Could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ?
Turn 333, B (Professor): Yeah , do it with one of {disfmarker} on
Turn 334, E (Grad): Cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike , but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .
Turn 335, A (PhD): Right . I understand that . I just meant that {disfmarker} so you have {pause} three choices . There 's , um {disfmarker} You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were {disfmarker} were synchronized . Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just front - end those pieces . Or you can run it on the whole data , which is {disfmarker} which is , you know , a {disfmarker}
Turn 336, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but how did we get the {disfmarker} how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ?
Turn 337, A (PhD): In the H L T paper we took {pause} segments that are channel {disfmarker} time - aligned , which is now h being changed in the transcription process , which is good , and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here , because no one else had time {disfmarker} any words in that segment and called that " non - overlap " .
Turn 338, B (Professor): And tha And that 's what we were getting those numbers from .
Turn 339, A (PhD): Yes . Tho - good {disfmarker} the good numbers .
Turn 340, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 341, A (PhD): The bad numbers were from {pause} the segments where there was overlap .
Turn 342, B (Professor): Well , we could start with the good ones .
Turn 343, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 344, B (Professor): But anyway {disfmarker} so I think that we should try it once with {vocalsound} the same conditions that were used to create those , and in those same segments just use one of the P Z
Turn 345, A (PhD): Right . So we {disfmarker} we can do that . Yeah .
Turn 346, B (Professor): And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh {disfmarker} what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on {disfmarker} on that particular set , uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?
Turn 347, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 348, B (Professor): Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?
Turn 349, A (PhD): It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ?
Turn 350, B (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 351, A (PhD): I don't know how different they are from each other .
Turn 352, F (PhD): You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker .
Turn 353, A (PhD): To be best {disfmarker}
Turn 354, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 355, E (Grad): For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one .
Turn 356, A (PhD): f
Turn 357, B (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 358, A (PhD): OK . So we would then use that one , too ,
Turn 359, E (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 360, F (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 361, B (Professor): This is kind of central .
Turn 362, A (PhD): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 363, B (Professor): You know , it 's {disfmarker} so i but I would {disfmarker} I 'd pick that one . It 'll be less good for some people than for other , but I {disfmarker} I 'd like to see it on the same {disfmarker} exact same data set that {disfmarker} that we did the other thing on .
Turn 364, E (Grad): Actually {disfmarker} I sh actually should 've picked a different one ,
Turn 365, B (Professor): Right ?
Turn 366, E (Grad): because {pause} that could be why the PDA is worse . Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits .
Turn 367, D (PhD): It 's further away . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 368, B (Professor): That 's probably one of the reasons .
Turn 369, C (Postdoc): Hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 370, A (PhD): Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something .
Turn 371, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 372, B (Professor): But the other is , it 's very , uh {disfmarker} I mean , even though there 's {disfmarker} I 'm sure the f f the {disfmarker} the SRI , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy .
Turn 373, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 374, B (Professor): So , even discriminating against it , I 'm sure some of it 's getting through . Um . But , yeah , you 're right . Prob - a part of it is just the distance .
Turn 375, A (PhD): And aren't these pretty bad microphones ?
Turn 376, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 377, A (PhD): I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 378, B (Professor): Well , they 're bad . But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ? u Yeah .
Turn 379, E (Grad): Yeah . When you listen to it , uh , the PZM and the PDA {disfmarker} Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor but not by a lot . It 's really pretty {disfmarker} uh , pretty much the same .
Turn 380, A (PhD): I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose . Cheap in terms of their quality . So .
Turn 381, B (Professor): Well , they 're {pause} twenty - five cents or so .
Turn 382, E (Grad): Th - we wanted them to be {disfmarker} to be typical of what would be in a PDA .
Turn 383, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 384, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 385, E (Grad): So they are {disfmarker} they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type . They 're the twenty - five cent ,
Turn 386, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 387, E (Grad): buy them in packs of thousand type .
Turn 388, A (PhD): I see .
Turn 389, B (Professor): But , I mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything because they 're really not bad .
Turn 390, E (Grad): Everything .
Turn 391, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 392, B (Professor): I mean , if you 're not {vocalsound} doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {disfmarker} you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .
Turn 393, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 394, B (Professor): You know , it 's {disfmarker} They {disfmarker} I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under , it 's just that {pause} there 's less quality control . They just , you know , churn them out and don't check them . Um . So . So that was {disfmarker} Yeah . So that was i interesting result . So like I said , the front - end guys are very much interested in {disfmarker} in this is as {disfmarker} as well and
Turn 395, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} so , but where is this now ? I mean , what 's {disfmarker} where do we go from here ?
Turn 396, E (Grad): Yeah . That was gonna be my question .
Turn 397, F (PhD): I mean , we {disfmarker} so we have a {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} a system that works pretty well but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using {disfmarker} to working with .
Turn 398, B (Professor): Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to {disfmarker} eh ,
Turn 399, F (PhD): So what {disfmarker} what do we do now ?
Turn 400, B (Professor): and we 've talked about this in other {pause} contexts {disfmarker} we want to {vocalsound} have the ability to feed it different features .
Turn 401, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 402, B (Professor): And then , um , {vocalsound} from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK .
Turn 403, F (PhD): OK . OK .
Turn 404, B (Professor): I think that 's the key thing . And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .
Turn 405, F (PhD): OK . Alright .
Turn 406, B (Professor): And then , um , uh , also Dave is {disfmarker} is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to {vocalsound} um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation
Turn 407, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 408, B (Professor): starting with some techniques that some other people have {pause} found somewhat useful , and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 409, F (PhD): OK . So {disfmarker} so the key {pause} thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features {vocalsound} i into the recognizer
Turn 410, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 411, F (PhD): and also then to train the system .
Turn 412, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 413, F (PhD): OK . And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back but that 's exactly what he {disfmarker} he 's gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 414, B (Professor): H h He 's {disfmarker} he 's sort of back , but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today .
Turn 415, F (PhD): Oh , OK . So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . Um .
Turn 416, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 417, F (PhD): Just sort of t to make sure that {pause} we can do that
Turn 418, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 419, F (PhD): and {disfmarker} Um .
Turn 420, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 421, F (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} uh , I mean , the {disfmarker} the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately {pause} is not {pause} designed and , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of {disfmarker} of the command . So , the {disfmarker} what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um {disfmarker} you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files and {pause} give those files to the recognizer .
Turn 422, E (Grad): We do {disfmarker} we tend to do that anyway .
Turn 423, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 424, E (Grad): Oh . So , although you {disfmarker} you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over .
Turn 425, F (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 426, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 427, F (PhD): Alright .
Turn 428, B (Professor): Yeah . So I 've {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 429, E (Grad): So tha that 's exactly what the P - file {pause} is for .
Turn 430, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 431, F (PhD): Yeah , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the cumbersome thing is {disfmarker} is , um {disfmarker} is that you actually have to dump out little {disfmarker} little files .
Turn 432, A (PhD): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 433, F (PhD): So for each segment that you want to recognize {vocalsound} you have to {pause} dump out {pause} a separate file .
Turn 434, E (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 435, F (PhD): Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , but instead you have sort of feature file segments . But , you know {disfmarker} So .
Turn 436, B (Professor): Cool . OK . So the s the {disfmarker} the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?
Turn 437, A (PhD): Oh . Yes , we have {disfmarker} I don't know , did you wanna talk about it , or {disfmarker} ? I can give a {disfmarker} I was just telling this to Jane and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} W we {disfmarker} we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors {pause} that were occurring and um , some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a um , I think was both a {disfmarker} a pruning {pause} problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations . And so we tried both of these st things . We tried saying {disfmarker} I don't know , I got this {vocalsound} whacky idea that {disfmarker} just from looking at the data , that when people talk {pause} their words are usually chunked together . It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . They 're {comment} might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . So , um {disfmarker} And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too {disfmarker} too severe .
Turn 438, F (PhD): So that 's actually interesting . The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . And we had lowered that {disfmarker} we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in {disfmarker}
Turn 439, A (PhD): Actually it was better with {disfmarker} slightly better or about th
Turn 440, E (Grad): No gain .
Turn 441, A (PhD): it was the same with tighter pruning .
Turn 442, F (PhD): Right . So for free recognition , this {disfmarker} the lower pruning value is better .
Turn 443, A (PhD): It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that {disfmarker} that you don't lose anything .
Turn 444, F (PhD): You {disfmarker} Correct . Right . Um , but it turned out for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .
Turn 445, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 446, B (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 447, F (PhD): Um {pause} because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker .
Turn 448, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 449, F (PhD): Um , {vocalsound} so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as Liz said the {disfmarker} we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . It cannot be {disfmarker} you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .
Turn 450, A (PhD): Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves {pause} a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it {disfmarker}
Turn 451, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 452, A (PhD): those would be able to do that ,
Turn 453, C (Postdoc): Sorry .
Turn 454, A (PhD): but the rest would be constrained . So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers . I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . And , um , we basically also made noise models for the different {disfmarker} sort of grouped some of the {pause} mouth noises together . Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . And we also {disfmarker} There was some neat {disfmarker} or , interesting cases , like there 's one meeting where , {vocalsound} um , Jose 's giving a presentation and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed {pause} signal " and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying " mixed " {disfmarker} I think , Morgan . And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal .
Turn 455, H (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 456, A (PhD): And the next turn was a lot of people saying " mixed " , like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " . And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times .
Turn 457, H (PhD): Sh
Turn 458, A (PhD): And Chuck 's on the lapel here , and he also says " mixed " but it 's at the last one , and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's " mixed " ,
Turn 459, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 460, A (PhD): cuz there 's no adaptation yet . So there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think there 's some issues about {disfmarker} u We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . Like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .
Turn 461, F (PhD): Oh {disfmarker}
Turn 462, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 463, A (PhD): So there 's some things there ,
Turn 464, H (PhD): Oh .
Turn 465, A (PhD): especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the {disfmarker}
Turn 466, F (PhD): Well , the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you can do better by {vocalsound} uh , cloning {disfmarker} so we have a reject phone . And you {disfmarker} and what we wanted to try with {disfmarker} you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , {vocalsound} uh , t cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground , like fragments and stuff , and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker .
Turn 467, A (PhD): Right . I mean , in general we actually {disfmarker}
Turn 468, F (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 469, A (PhD): Right now the words like {pause} partial words are {pause} reject models and you normally allow those to match to any word .
Turn 470, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 471, A (PhD): But then the background speech was also a reject model , and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between {disfmarker} you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .
Turn 472, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 473, A (PhD): And another one is turns , like people starting with {vocalsound} " well I think " and someone else is {pause} " well how about " . So the word " well " is in this {disfmarker} in this {pause} segment multiple times , and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it . But then that constraint of sort of {disfmarker} uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general .
Turn 474, E (Grad): Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 475, F (PhD): We {disfmarker} we didn't {disfmarker}
Turn 476, A (PhD): Right now it 's a kluge .
Turn 477, F (PhD): No . We {disfmarker} w OK . We {disfmarker} it 's straightforward to actually just have a {disfmarker} a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it . But , um , we just didn't have time to play with , you know , tuning yet another {disfmarker} yet another parameter .
Turn 478, E (Grad): The ve level . Yeah .
Turn 479, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 480, F (PhD): And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a {disfmarker} we don't have ground truth for these . So , {vocalsound} we would need a hand - marked , um , {vocalsound} word - level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers . Um , and then use that as a reference and tune the parameters of the {disfmarker} of the model , uh , to op to get the best {pause} performance .
Turn 481, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 482, B (Professor): G given {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better .
Turn 483, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 484, A (PhD): I looked at them . I spent two days {disfmarker} um , in Waves {disfmarker}
Turn 485, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 486, A (PhD): Oh , it was painful because {vocalsound} the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common , so {disfmarker} And you 're {disfmarker} yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech . I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words . Not by every speaker
Turn 487, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 488, A (PhD): but by some speaker there 's a lot of words . No , not {disfmarker}
Turn 489, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 490, A (PhD): I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words ,
Turn 491, H (PhD): Ju
Turn 492, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 493, A (PhD): but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there .
Turn 494, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 495, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 496, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 497, A (PhD): And so the reject is also mapping and pauses {disfmarker} So I looked at them all in Waves and just lined up all the alignments , and , at first it sort of looked like a mess and then the more I looked at it , I thought " OK , well it 's moving these words leftward and {disfmarker} " You know , it wasn't that bad . It was just doing certain things wrong . So {disfmarker} But , I don't , you know , have time to l {comment} to look at all of them and it would be really useful to have , like , a {disfmarker} a transcriber who could use Waves , um , just mark , like , the beginning and end of the foreground speaker 's real words {disfmarker} like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word {disfmarker} and then we could , you know , do some adjustments .
Turn 498, C (Postdoc): Yeah . I {disfmarker} OK . I have to ask you something , is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , {comment} that would help .
Turn 499, F (PhD): No .
Turn 500, C (Postdoc): And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances . Um , I didn't do it word level ,
Turn 501, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 502, C (Postdoc): but {disfmarker} but in terms {disfmarker}
Turn 503, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 504, C (Postdoc): So I {disfmarker} so for {disfmarker} for one of the N S A groups . And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and {disfmarker} and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . So I think you do have {disfmarker} if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . But it 'd be wonderful to be able to {vocalsound} benefit from your Waves stuff .
Turn 505, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 506, F (PhD): We don't care what {disfmarker} what tool you use .
Turn 507, A (PhD): Yeah . I mean , if {disfmarker} if you can , um {disfmarker} if you wanna {disfmarker}
Turn 508, C (Postdoc): OK . I used it in Transcriber
Turn 509, F (PhD): U uh {disfmarker}
Turn 510, C (Postdoc): and it 's {disfmarker} it 's in the {disfmarker}
Turn 511, A (PhD): well , Jane and I were {disfmarker} just in terms of the tool , talking about this . I guess Sue had had some {pause} reactions . You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are . And so , {vocalsound} we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like ,
Turn 512, C (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right . Middle of the word , or {disfmarker}
Turn 513, A (PhD): um , and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way , or {disfmarker}
Turn 514, C (Postdoc): Well , I th I 'm thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation .
Turn 515, A (PhD): Um .
Turn 516, C (Postdoc): I mean , if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 517, A (PhD): You mean like {disfmarker} Yeah , word start insights .
Turn 518, C (Postdoc): if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags ,
Turn 519, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 520, C (Postdoc): which is what I assume . Isn't that what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} ? Well , see , Adam would be {disfmarker}
Turn 521, F (PhD): Yeah , whatever you use .
Turn 522, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 523, F (PhD): I mean , we convert it to this format that the , um , NIST scoring tool unders uh , CTM . Conversation Time - Marked file . And {disfmarker} and then that 's the {disfmarker} that 's what the {disfmarker}
Turn 524, E (Grad): I think Transcriber , uh , outputs CTM .
Turn 525, C (Postdoc): If it {disfmarker} ? OK .
Turn 526, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 527, C (Postdoc): So you would know this more than I would .
Turn 528, E (Grad): I think so .
Turn 529, A (PhD): So , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 530, C (Postdoc): It seems like she {disfmarker} if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around ,
Turn 531, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 532, C (Postdoc): since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of {disfmarker} of using that {disfmarker} benefitting from that .
Turn 533, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 534, A (PhD): Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able {disfmarker} if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words ,
Turn 535, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 536, A (PhD): you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time , if you wanted to do that .
Turn 537, B (Professor): So {disfmarker} so if we e e even just had a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} It sounds like w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we almost do .
Turn 538, A (PhD): So .
Turn 539, B (Professor): Uh , if we {disfmarker} We have two .
Turn 540, C (Postdoc): We have two .
Turn 541, B (Professor): Yeah . Just ha uh , trying out {pause} the alignment {vocalsound} procedure that you have on that
Turn 542, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 543, B (Professor): you could actually get something , um {disfmarker} uh , uh , get an objective measure . Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 544, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 545, A (PhD): You mean on {disfmarker} on the hand - marked , um {disfmarker} So we {disfmarker} we only r hav I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose ,
Turn 546, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 547, A (PhD): I think MR four , just randomly , um {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Turn 548, F (PhD): Actually , not randomly .
Turn 549, A (PhD): Not randomly {disfmarker}
Turn 550, F (PhD): We knew {disfmarker} we knew that it had these insertion errors from {disfmarker}
Turn 551, A (PhD): It had sort of {pause} average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers
Turn 552, F (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 553, A (PhD): and it was a Meeting Recorder meeting . Um . But , yeah , we should try to use what you have . I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one .
Turn 554, C (Postdoc): Oh , good .
Turn 555, A (PhD): I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the one with Dan {pause} Ellis in it {vocalsound} and Eric .
Turn 556, C (Postdoc): Good ! Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 557, G (Grad): I don't think that was the new version .
Turn 558, A (PhD): Um {disfmarker} That {disfmarker} Yeah , actually it wasn't the new new , it was the medium new .
Turn 559, C (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 560, A (PhD): But {disfmarker} but we would {disfmarker} we should do the {disfmarker} the latest version .
Turn 561, C (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 562, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 563, A (PhD): It was the one from last week .
Turn 564, G (Grad): You {disfmarker} did you adjust the {disfmarker} the utterance times , um , for each channel ?
Turn 565, C (Postdoc): Yes . Yes , I did . And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where {disfmarker} {vocalsound} not {disfmarker} not a lot , but several times I actually {vocalsound} moved an utterance from {vocalsound} Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's . So there was some speaker identif And the reason was because {vocalsound} I transcribed that at a point before {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , before we had the multiple audio available f so I couldn't switch between the audio . I {disfmarker} I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely , which meant in overlaps , I was at a {disfmarker} at a terrific disadvantage .
Turn 566, A (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 567, C (Postdoc): In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there . And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of {disfmarker} you know , off the CPU on my {disfmarker} on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone .
Turn 568, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 569, C (Postdoc): So it @ @ , like , I mean {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I mean , i in retrospect {vocalsound} it would 've been good to ha {vocalsound} have got I should 've gotten a headphone . But in any case , um , thi this is {disfmarker} this was transcribed in a {disfmarker} in a , {vocalsound} uh , less optimal way than {disfmarker} than the ones that came after it , and I was able to {disfmarker} you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications which were changes .
Turn 570, G (Grad): Well , I know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions .
Turn 571, C (Postdoc): Yeah . Fixed that .
Turn 572, G (Grad): Is that what you 're referring to ? I mean , cuz there 's this one instance when , for example , you 're running down the stairs .
Turn 573, C (Postdoc): Oh , well {disfmarker}
Turn 574, G (Grad): I remember this meeting really well .
Turn 575, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 576, A (PhD): Don {disfmarker} Don has had {disfmarker} {vocalsound} He knows {disfmarker} he can just read it like a play .
Turn 577, G (Grad): Right . It 's a {disfmarker} Yeah , I 've {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 'm very well acquainted with this meeting .
Turn 578, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 579, G (Grad): Yeah , I can s
Turn 580, A (PhD): " And then she said , and then he said . "
Turn 581, G (Grad): Yeah , I know it by heart . So , um , {vocalsound} there 's one point when you 're running down the stairs .
Turn 582, C (Postdoc): Uh - oh .
Turn 583, G (Grad): Right ? And , like , there 's an interruption . You interrupt somebody , but then there 's no line after that . For example , there 's no speaker identification after that line .
Turn 584, C (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 585, G (Grad): Is that what you 're talking about ? Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was {disfmarker} ?
Turn 586, C (Postdoc): That was fixed , um , before {disfmarker} i i i I think I I think I understood that pretty {disfmarker}
Turn 587, G (Grad): Yeah . Cuz I thought I let you know about that .
Turn 588, C (Postdoc): Thank you for mentioning . Yeah , no , tha that {disfmarker} That I think went away a couple of versions ago ,
Turn 589, G (Grad): Yeah . OK .
Turn 590, C (Postdoc): but it 's good to know .
Turn 591, G (Grad): But you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified .
Turn 592, C (Postdoc): Yeah . So , with {disfmarker} under {disfmarker} um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa {disfmarker}
Turn 593, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 594, C (Postdoc): not for long utterances ,
Turn 595, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 596, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 597, C (Postdoc): but jus just a couple of places ,
Turn 598, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 599, C (Postdoc): and embedde embedded in overlaps . The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal ,
Turn 600, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 601, C (Postdoc): which , you know , I mean , you c not {disfmarker} not too surprising . But the other thing that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hadn't thought about this , but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were {disfmarker} uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially , but that 's {disfmarker} When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very often in {disfmarker} w well , I won't say " usually " {disfmarker} but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel {vocalsound} w which was the person who had asked a question . S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? " And then there would be backchannels , but it would be the person who asked the question . Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling . And , you know , sometimes you have the {disfmarker} Yeah , uh - huh .
Turn 602, A (PhD): Well , that 's interesting . Yeah .
Turn 603, C (Postdoc): I mean , i it wouldn't be perfect , but {disfmarker} but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when {disfmarker} when you 're somehow involved in the topic ,
Turn 604, A (PhD): No , that 's really interesting .
Turn 605, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 606, C (Postdoc): and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question .
Turn 607, F (PhD): Well ,
Turn 608, A (PhD): That 's interesting .
Turn 609, F (PhD): I think {disfmarker} No . I think it 's {disfmarker} actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations .
Turn 610, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 611, F (PhD): And if you ask someone a question , you essentially initiating a little two - party conversation .
Turn 612, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 613, A (PhD): Well , actu Yeah , when we looked at this {disfmarker}
Turn 614, C (Postdoc): Exactly .
Turn 615, F (PhD): So then you 're {disfmarker} so and then you 're expected to backchannel because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody .
Turn 616, C (Postdoc): Exactly . Exactly my point . An - and so this is the expectation thing that {disfmarker} uh , uh ,
Turn 617, F (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 618, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 619, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 620, C (Postdoc): just the dyadic {disfmarker}
Turn 621, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 622, C (Postdoc): But in addition , you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what {disfmarker} what the answer is that this {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the answerer 's given {disfmarker}
Turn 623, B (Professor): H
Turn 624, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 625, B (Professor): I tell you , I say {disfmarker} I say " uh - huh " a lot ,
Turn 626, A (PhD): It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 627, C (Postdoc): There you go .
Turn 628, A (PhD): Well , but it 's interesting cuz , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 629, B (Professor): while people are talking to each other .
Turn 630, A (PhD): But there are fewer {disfmarker} I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " .
Turn 631, C (Postdoc): There you go . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 632, A (PhD): I mean , just from {disfmarker} We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment . You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words .
Turn 633, C (Postdoc): Oh , yeah .
Turn 634, A (PhD): And " uh - huh " is not as frequent as it sort of would be in Switchboard , if you looked at just a word frequency list of one - word short utterances . And " yeah " is way up there , but not " uh - huh " . And so I was thinking thi it 's not like {pause} you 're being encouraged by everybody else to keep {pause} talking in the meeting . And uh , that 's all , I I 'll stop there , cuz I I think what you say makes a lot of sense .
Turn 635, C (Postdoc): Well , that 's right . And that would {disfmarker}
Turn 636, A (PhD): But it was sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 637, C (Postdoc): Well , an And what you say is the {disfmarker} is the re uh , o other side of this , which is that , you know , so th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked and {disfmarker} and these {disfmarker}
Turn 638, A (PhD): Right . There 's just probably less backchannelling in general ,
Turn 639, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . So that 's good news , really .
Turn 640, A (PhD): even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting , but we 'll find out anyway . We were {disfmarker} I guess the other thing we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} I should say is that we 're gonna , um try {disfmarker} compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard , where {disfmarker}
Turn 641, F (PhD): And
Turn 642, A (PhD): and CallHome , where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , you know , {vocalsound} is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard
Turn 643, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 644, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 645, A (PhD): and we don't know what people are doing . Try to create a paper out of that .
Turn 646, B (Professor): Yeah . I mean , y y you folks have probably {pause} already told me , but were {disfmarker} were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 647, A (PhD): Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ?
Turn 648, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 649, A (PhD): Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts for doing the research , and we will {disfmarker} Yes , we 're gonna try .
Turn 650, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 651, A (PhD): And I was telling Don , do not {pause} take this as an example of how people should work .
Turn 652, B (Professor): Do as I say ,
Turn 653, G (Grad): That 's r
Turn 654, A (PhD): So , {comment} we will try .
Turn 655, B (Professor): don't do as I do . Yeah .
Turn 656, A (PhD): It 'll probably be a little late ,
Turn 657, E (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 658, A (PhD): but I 'm gonna try it .
Turn 659, E (Grad): It is different . In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now , not the full paper .
Turn 660, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 661, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 662, E (Grad): And so all our timing was off . I 've given up on trying to do digits . I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper .
Turn 663, A (PhD): Well , I 'm no We may be in the same position , and I figured {vocalsound} we 'll try , because that 'll at least get us to the point where we have {disfmarker} We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's not very fancy . It 's just a ASCII line by line format , but it does give you information {disfmarker}
Turn 664, F (PhD): It 's the {disfmarker} it 's the spurt format .
Turn 665, A (PhD): It {disfmarker} Yeah , we 're calling these " spurts " after Chafe . I was trying to find what 's a word for {pause} a continuous region with {pause} pauses around it ?
Turn 666, C (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 667, B (Professor): Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use {disfmarker} use " spurt " for that .
Turn 668, C (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 669, A (PhD): They do ? Oh !
Turn 670, B (Professor): Yes .
Turn 671, F (PhD): Oh .
Turn 672, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 673, B (Professor): And that 's {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff ,
Turn 674, A (PhD): I would jus
Turn 675, B (Professor): because I {disfmarker} because I looked up in some books and I found {disfmarker} OK , I wanna find a spurt {vocalsound} in which {disfmarker}
Turn 676, A (PhD): Ah , right ! It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics .
Turn 677, B (Professor): and {disfmarker} an because {disfmarker} cuz it 's another question about how {pause} many pauses they put in between them .
Turn 678, E (Grad): Horrible .
Turn 679, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 680, B (Professor): But how fast do they do {pause} the words within the spurt ?
Turn 681, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 682, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 683, A (PhD): Well , that 's what we were calling spurt ,
Turn 684, E (Grad): It 's gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 685, G (Grad): you know " Burst " also ?
Turn 686, E (Grad): Burst .
Turn 687, G (Grad): Isn't " burst " is used also ?
Turn 688, A (PhD): so {disfmarker}
Turn 689, E (Grad): Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other {disfmarker} with hardware at ICSI .
Turn 690, B (Professor): Here . Just very locally , yeah .
Turn 691, A (PhD): Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a {disfmarker} the word " spurt " originally ,
Turn 692, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} but that just {disfmarker}
Turn 693, H (PhD): Here @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 694, A (PhD): and so I {disfmarker} But tha that 's good to know .
Turn 695, C (Postdoc): Actually {disfmarker}
Turn 696, A (PhD): Was thi it 's Chafe ?
Turn 697, C (Postdoc): Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development .
Turn 698, F (PhD): So maybe we should talk {disfmarker}
Turn 699, A (PhD): Maybe it was Sue {disfmarker} ? Y
Turn 700, C (Postdoc): But , in any case , I think it 's a good term ,
Turn 701, A (PhD): So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify
Turn 702, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 703, C (Postdoc): and , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 704, E (Grad): Hmm !
Turn 705, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 706, C (Postdoc): And ma maybe {disfmarker} maybe Chafe did .
Turn 707, F (PhD): Uh .
Turn 708, A (PhD): And then it 's got all {disfmarker} it 's a verb now .
Turn 709, C (Postdoc): I know {disfmarker} I know Ch - Chafe dealt with {disfmarker}
Turn 710, F (PhD): So s
Turn 711, G (Grad): That 's cool .
Turn 712, F (PhD): W uh , w
Turn 713, C (Postdoc): Chafe speaks about intonation units .
Turn 714, A (PhD): Yes . Right .
Turn 715, C (Postdoc): But maybe he speaks about spurts as well
Turn 716, F (PhD): We
Turn 717, C (Postdoc): and I just don't know . Yeah , go ahead .
Turn 718, E (Grad): I 've heard " burst " also .
Turn 719, F (PhD): So what we 're doing {disfmarker} uh , this {disfmarker} this is just {disfmarker} maybe someone has s some {disfmarker} some ideas about how to do it better ,
Turn 720, G (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 721, F (PhD): but we {disfmarker} So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels . We 're {disfmarker} from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files ,
Turn 722, C (Postdoc): Great .
Turn 723, F (PhD): which essentially has {disfmarker} it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration .
Turn 724, A (PhD): It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ?
Turn 725, F (PhD): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and of course {disfmarker}
Turn 726, A (PhD): It 's just {disfmarker}
Turn 727, F (PhD): Right . But it has {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} the first column has the meeting name , so it could actually contain several meetings . Um . And the second column is the channel . Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words . And then we 're , um {disfmarker} OK . Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the , uh , tags for , like , where {disfmarker} where sentence {disfmarker} ends of sentence , question marks , um , {vocalsound} various other things .
Turn 728, A (PhD): Yeah . These are things that we had Don {disfmarker}
Turn 729, F (PhD): Uh .
Turn 730, A (PhD): So , Don sort of , um , propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber {disfmarker}
Turn 731, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 732, A (PhD): so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , {vocalsound} um , you know , comma and things like that , and we kept the {disfmarker} and disfluency dashes {disfmarker} uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps {disfmarker}
Turn 733, F (PhD): Mm - hmm . Right .
Turn 734, A (PhD): sp overlaps ,
Turn 735, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} so those are actually sort of retro - fitted into the time alignment .
Turn 736, A (PhD): or {disfmarker}
Turn 737, F (PhD): And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time . And then there 's a {disfmarker} then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts . That is {disfmarker} Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels . So you {disfmarker} you id identify by some criterion , which is pause length {disfmarker} you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts , and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight .
Turn 738, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 739, F (PhD): And then you merge everything in terms of , you know , linearizing the sequence based on the time marks . And then {vocalsound} you extract the individual channels again , but this time you know where the other people start and end talking {disfmarker} you know , where their spurts start and end . And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were . Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end {pause} tags for overlaps . So , you {disfmarker} you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech .
Turn 740, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 741, A (PhD): Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also
Turn 742, F (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 743, A (PhD): because even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ? You have to be able to {pause} get a transcript like {disfmarker} like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition . So , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 744, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 745, A (PhD): I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before , how you time - align things that are overlapping anyway .
Turn 746, C (Postdoc): That 's wonderful .
Turn 747, F (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 748, A (PhD): I mean , i I never thought about it before ,
Turn 749, E (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 750, F (PhD): And {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}
Turn 751, A (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 752, E (Grad): Y yes .
Turn 753, F (PhD): In {disfmarker}
Turn 754, E (Grad): I mean , s when I came up with the original data {disfmarker} suggested data format based on the transcription graph , there 's capability of doing that sort of thing in there .
Turn 755, A (PhD): Right . But you can't get it directly from the transcription .
Turn 756, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah , that 's right .
Turn 757, F (PhD): Right . Well , this is {disfmarker} this is just {disfmarker}
Turn 758, A (PhD): Yeah , this is like a poor man 's ver formatting version . But it 's , you know {disfmarker} It 's clean , it 's just not fancy .
Turn 759, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 760, A (PhD): Um .
Turn 761, F (PhD): Well , there 's lots of little things . It 's like there 're twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want . But , um , at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information . All we care about is whether {disfmarker} that there 's a certain word was overlapped by someone else 's word . So you sort of {disfmarker} at that point , you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap . Because we figure that 's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper .
Turn 762, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 763, F (PhD): But if you wanted to do a more fine - grained analysis and say , you know , how far into the word is the overlap , you could do that .
Turn 764, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 765, F (PhD): It 's just {disfmarker} it 'll just require more {disfmarker}
Turn 766, A (PhD): Just {pause} sort of huge .
Turn 767, F (PhD): you know , slightly different {disfmarker}
Turn 768, C (Postdoc): What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this ,
Turn 769, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 770, C (Postdoc): um , she , um , i i i indicated that that {disfmarker} you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis .
Turn 771, A (PhD): Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to know ,
Turn 772, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 773, A (PhD): and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur . So I can have two foreground speakers , you know , Morgan an and {vocalsound} um , Adam and Jane could all be talking , and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time , and then look where they are relative to each other , and that 's not really what I heard .
Turn 774, C (Postdoc): And that 's another thing she said .
Turn 775, A (PhD): Cuz it 's just hard to do .
Turn 776, C (Postdoc): This is {disfmarker} This is Bever 's {disfmarker} Bever 's effect ,
Turn 777, A (PhD): Y Yeah .
Turn 778, C (Postdoc): when {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear ,
Turn 779, A (PhD): It 's sort of {disfmarker} Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a {pause} low information point
Turn 780, C (Postdoc): that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Not the best {disfmarker}
Turn 781, A (PhD): and yo then you can bring in the other person . So it 's {vocalsound} actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal , even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order . So , I guess , we 'll try to write this Eurospeech paper .
Turn 782, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Superb .
Turn 783, A (PhD): I mean , we will write it . Whether they accept it {pause} late or not , I don't know . Um , and the good thing is that we have {disfmarker} It 's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other .
Turn 784, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 785, B (Professor): Yeah . That 's the good thing about these pape
Turn 786, A (PhD): So . i You know , might as well .
Turn 787, F (PhD): Plus , mayb
Turn 788, H (PhD): Hmm ?
Turn 789, A (PhD): We - I ju Otherwise we won't get the work done {comment} {vocalsound} on our deadline .
Turn 790, F (PhD): I don't know , m
Turn 791, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 792, F (PhD): I mean , u u Jane likes to look at data . Maybe , you know , you could {disfmarker} you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting .
Turn 793, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 794, F (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 795, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 796, B (Professor): No , it 's {disfmarker} that 's the good thing about these pape paper deadlines and , uh , you know , class projects , and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and things like that ,
Turn 797, C (Postdoc): Well , what I 'm thinking is {disfmarker}
Turn 798, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 799, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 800, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 801, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 802, C (Postdoc): Well , my {disfmarker}
Turn 803, F (PhD): Well th th the other thing that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that yo that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that , um , you know , strictly enforced ,
Turn 804, B (Professor): because you {disfmarker} you really get g
Turn 805, A (PhD): Forces you to do the work .
Turn 806, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 807, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 808, A (PhD): Exactly .
Turn 809, E (Grad): Strict .
Turn 810, F (PhD): because {pause} the {disfmarker}
Turn 811, B (Professor): Oh , now it 's out in the public , this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this secret information .
Turn 812, F (PhD): because {disfmarker}
Turn 813, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 814, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 815, C (Postdoc): I think we can ha
Turn 816, F (PhD): bec b {vocalsound} Nah {disfmarker}
Turn 817, A (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 818, E (Grad): No .
Turn 819, B (Professor): No .
Turn 820, C (Postdoc): Nah .
Turn 821, F (PhD): i Because these {disfmarker} the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions .
Turn 822, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 823, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 824, F (PhD): I mean , a {disfmarker} a monetary interest .
Turn 825, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 826, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um .
Turn 827, B (Professor): Th - that 's {disfmarker} that 's true .
Turn 828, C (Postdoc): And good ones , good ones , which sometimes means {pause} a little extra time .
Turn 829, F (PhD): And good submission
Turn 830, B (Professor): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 831, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 832, B (Professor): That 's true .
Turn 833, F (PhD): Well {disfmarker} That 's another issue ,
Turn 834, B (Professor): By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may {disfmarker} you may feel ,
Turn 835, F (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 836, B (Professor): but the {disfmarker} the , uh {disfmarker} the morning meeting folks actually have an {disfmarker} an extra month or so .
Turn 837, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 838, D (PhD): Yep .
Turn 839, E (Grad): Yep . The Aurora {disfmarker} there 's a special Aurora {disfmarker}
Turn 840, A (PhD): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 841, F (PhD): When {disfmarker}
Turn 842, B (Professor): There 's a special Aurora session
Turn 843, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 844, B (Professor): and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May {pause} or something to turn in their paper .
Turn 845, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 846, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 847, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 848, A (PhD): Oh , well maybe we 'll submit to s {comment} {vocalsound} Actually {disfmarker}
Turn 849, F (PhD): Well , then you can just {disfmarker} Maybe you can submit the digits paper on e for the Aurora session .
Turn 850, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 851, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 852, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 853, E (Grad): Oh , I could !
Turn 854, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 855, B (Professor): I if it w
Turn 856, E (Grad): I could submit that to Aurora .
Turn 857, B (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 858, E (Grad): That would be pretty {disfmarker} pretty {disfmarker}
Turn 859, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 860, B (Professor): i it has {disfmarker}
Turn 861, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 862, B (Professor): 
Turn 863, E (Grad): S That wouldn't work .
Turn 864, B (Professor): No , it wouldn't work .
Turn 865, E (Grad): It 's not Aurora .
Turn 866, B (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} it 's not the Aurora {disfmarker} I mean , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's actually the Aurora task .
Turn 867, A (PhD): Maybe they 'll get s
Turn 868, E (Grad): Aurora 's very specific .
Turn 869, B (Professor): It
Turn 870, A (PhD): Well , maybe it won't be after this {vocalsound} deadline {pause} extension .
Turn 871, F (PhD): But {disfmarker} but the people {disfmarker} I mean , a {disfmarker} a paper that is not on Aurora would probably be more interesting at that point
Turn 872, A (PhD): Maybe they 'll {disfmarker}
Turn 873, F (PhD): because everybody 's so sick and tired of the Aurora task .
Turn 874, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 875, E (Grad): Oh , I thought you meant this was just the digits section . I didn't know you meant it was Aurora digits .
Turn 876, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 877, F (PhD): Well , no . If you {disfmarker} if you have {disfmarker} it 's to {disfmarker} if you discuss some relation to the Aurora task , like if you use the same {disfmarker}
Turn 878, B (Professor): This is not the Aurora task . So they just do a little grep for {disfmarker}
Turn 879, A (PhD): Do {disfmarker} uh , d d Do not {disfmarker} do not {disfmarker} we are not setting a good example .
Turn 880, F (PhD): Um . Well , a relation other than negation , maybe ,
Turn 881, A (PhD): This is not a {disfmarker}
Turn 882, F (PhD): um . So .
Turn 883, A (PhD): Anyway .
Turn 884, F (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 885, A (PhD): But the good thing is this does {disfmarker}
Turn 886, E (Grad): Well , I I don't know . I mean , you could {disfmarker} you could do a paper on {pause} what 's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to {pause} other ways of doing it .
Turn 887, F (PhD): How well does an Aurora system do on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} you know , on digits collected in a {disfmarker} in this environment ?
Turn 888, H (PhD): 
Turn 889, E (Grad): Different way . Yeah .
Turn 890, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 891, B (Professor): Maybe .
Turn 892, F (PhD): Maybe .
Turn 893, E (Grad): Pretty hokey .
Turn 894, B (Professor): I think it 's a littl little far - fetched . Nah , I mean , the thing is Aurora 's pretty closed community .
Turn 895, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 896, B (Professor): I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who {disfmarker} who made it above a certain threshold in the first round ,
Turn 897, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 898, E (Grad): It 's very specific .
Turn 899, B (Professor): uh {vocalsound} w in ninety - nine and it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of a {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} not like a {disfmarker}
Turn 900, F (PhD): Well , that 's maybe why they don't f know that they have a crummy system . I mean , a crummy back - end . No , I mean {disfmarker} I mean , seriously , if you {disfmarker} if you have a very {disfmarker} No , I 'm sorry .
Turn 901, A (PhD): Uh , {comment} " beep " {vocalsound} " bee "
Turn 902, E (Grad): I mean , th
Turn 903, F (PhD): No . I didn't mean anybody {disfmarker} any particular system . I meant this H T K back - end .
Turn 904, B (Professor): Oh , you don't like HTK ?
Turn 905, F (PhD): If they {disfmarker}
Turn 906, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 907, F (PhD): I don't h I don't have any stock in HTK or Entropic or anything .
Turn 908, B (Professor): No . I mean , this {disfmarker} it it 's the HTK {pause} that is trained on a very limited amount of data .
Turn 909, E (Grad): It 's d it 's very specific .
Turn 910, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 911, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 912, F (PhD): But so , if you {disfmarker} But maybe you should , you know , consider more {disfmarker} using more data , or {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 913, B (Professor): Oh , yeah . I {disfmarker} I really think that that 's true . And they i i
Turn 914, F (PhD): If yo if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right , then you 're gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 915, E (Grad): But they {disfmarker} they had {disfmarker}
Turn 916, B (Professor): i But {disfmarker}
Turn 917, E (Grad): They had something very specific in mind when they designed it . Right ?
Turn 918, B (Professor): Well , u i
Turn 919, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 920, E (Grad): And so {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do , but , you know , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they had something specific .
Turn 921, B (Professor): But , one of the reasons I have Chuck 's messing around with {disfmarker} with the back - end that you 're not supposed to touch {disfmarker} I mean , for the evaluations , yes , we 'll run a version that hasn't been touched .
Turn 922, F (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 923, B (Professor): But , uh , one of the reasons I have him messing around with that , because I think it 's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to . People always say very glibly {vocalsound} that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything , cuz it may not be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} show {disfmarker} uh , because , you know , it doesn't tell you anything about the good system .
Turn 924, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 925, B (Professor): And I {disfmarker} I 've always sort of felt that that depends . You know , that if some peopl If you 're actually are getting at something that has some {pause} conceptual substance to it , it will port .
Turn 926, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 927, B (Professor): And in fact , most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute {pause} best system at some level . But of course , sometimes it doesn't , uh , port . So I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's an interesting question . If we 're getting {pause} three percent error on , uh , u uh , English , uh , nati native speakers , {vocalsound} um , using the Aurora system , and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two , {vocalsound} do those same improvements bring , uh , th you know , the SRI system from one point three to {disfmarker} you know , to {vocalsound} point eight ?
Turn 928, F (PhD): Hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 929, E (Grad): Zero .
Turn 930, B (Professor): Well . You know , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's something we can test .
Turn 931, F (PhD): Mmm . Right .
Turn 932, B (Professor): So . Anyway .
Turn 933, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 934, B (Professor): I think we 've {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 've covered that one up extremely well .
Turn 935, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 936, F (PhD): Whew !
Turn 937, B (Professor): OK . So , um {disfmarker} Yeah . So tha so we 'll {disfmarker} you know , maybe you guys 'll have {disfmarker} have one . Uh , you {disfmarker} you and , uh {disfmarker} and Dan have {disfmarker} have a paper that {disfmarker} that 's going in .
Turn 938, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 939, B (Professor): You know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation {pause} stuff .
Turn 940, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . I will send you the {disfmarker} the final version ,
Turn 941, B (Professor): Yeah . And the Aurora folks here will {disfmarker} will definitely get something in on Aurora ,
Turn 942, D (PhD): which is not {disfmarker}
Turn 943, F (PhD): Actually this {disfmarker} this , um {disfmarker} So , there 's another paper .
Turn 944, B (Professor): so .
Turn 945, F (PhD): It 's a Eurospeech paper but not related to meetings . But it 's on digits . So , um , uh , a colleague at SRI developed a improved version of MMIE training .
Turn 946, B (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 947, F (PhD): And he tested it mostly on digits because it 's sort of a {disfmarker} you know , it doesn't take weeks to train it .
Turn 948, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 949, F (PhD): Um . And got some very impressive results , um , with , you know , discriminative , uh , Gaussian training . Um , you know , like , um , error rates {pause} go from {disfmarker} I don't know , in very noisy environment , like from , uh , uh {disfmarker} I for now I {disfmarker} OK , now I have the order of magnit I 'm not sure about the order of magnitude . Was it like from ten percent to {vocalsound} eight percent or from e e you know , point {disfmarker} you know , from one percent to point eight percent ?
Turn 950, B (Professor): H i it got {disfmarker} it got better .
Turn 951, F (PhD): I mean , it 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 952, B (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 953, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 954, F (PhD): It got better . That 's the important thing .
Turn 955, E (Grad): Hey , that 's the same percent relative ,
Turn 956, F (PhD): Yeah . But it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 957, E (Grad): so {disfmarker}
Turn 958, F (PhD): Yeah . Right .
Turn 959, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 960, F (PhD): It 's , uh , something in {disfmarker}
Turn 961, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 962, E (Grad): Twenty percent relative gain .
Turn 963, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 964, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 965, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 966, B (Professor): Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} let 's see . I think the only thing we had left was {disfmarker} unless somebody else {disfmarker} Well , there 's a couple things . Uh , one is {pause} anything that , um , {vocalsound} anybody has to say about Saturday ? Anything we should do in prep for Saturday ? Um {disfmarker} I guess everybody knows about {disfmarker} I mean , u um , Mari was asking {disfmarker} was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we 're sort of fitting around people 's times a bit . But , um , {vocalsound} clearly when we actually get here we 'll {pause} move things around this , as we need to , but {disfmarker} so you can't absolutely count on it .
Turn 967, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 968, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 969, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 970, A (PhD): Are we meeting in here probably or {disfmarker} ? OK .
Turn 971, B (Professor): Yeah . That was my thought .
Turn 972, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 973, B (Professor): I think this is {disfmarker}
Turn 974, F (PhD): Are we recording it ?
Turn 975, A (PhD): We won't have enough microphones ,
Turn 976, B (Professor): 
Turn 977, A (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 978, B (Professor): u No . I {disfmarker} I hadn't in intended to .
Turn 979, A (PhD): There 's no way .
Turn 980, B (Professor): We won we wanna {disfmarker} I mean , they 're {disfmarker} there 's gonna be , uh , Jeff , Katrin , Mari and two students .
Turn 981, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 982, B (Professor): So there 's five {pause} from there .
Turn 983, E (Grad): And Brian .
Turn 984, B (Professor): And Brian 's coming ,
Turn 985, F (PhD): But you know th
Turn 986, B (Professor): so that 's six .
Turn 987, E (Grad): And plus all of us .
Turn 988, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 989, B (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 990, F (PhD): Can use the Oprah mike .
Turn 991, A (PhD): Depends how fast you can {pause} throw it .
Turn 992, E (Grad): It seems like too many {disfmarker} too much coming and going .
Turn 993, A (PhD): It 's just {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 994, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 995, A (PhD): We don't even have enough channel {disfmarker}
Turn 996, B (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 997, F (PhD): Because it would be a different kind of meeting ,
Turn 998, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 999, F (PhD): that 's what I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 1000, B (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1001, F (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1002, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1003, B (Professor): I hadn't {pause} really thought of it ,
Turn 1004, F (PhD): Maybe just {disfmarker} maybe not the whole day
Turn 1005, B (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 1006, F (PhD): but just , you know , maybe some {disfmarker} I mean ,
Turn 1007, B (Professor): Maybe part of it .
Turn 1008, F (PhD): part of it ?
Turn 1009, B (Professor): Maybe part of it .
Turn 1010, E (Grad): Make everyone read digits .
Turn 1011, B (Professor): At the same time .
Turn 1012, A (PhD): At the same time .
Turn 1013, E (Grad): At the same time .
Turn 1014, F (PhD): Please .
Turn 1015, H (PhD): 
Turn 1016, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1017, A (PhD): We c
Turn 1018, B (Professor): I don't know .
Turn 1019, A (PhD): That 's their initiation into our
Turn 1020, B (Professor): Any
Turn 1021, A (PhD): w
Turn 1022, E (Grad): Into our {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our cult .
Turn 1023, A (PhD): Yeah , our {disfmarker} Yeah , our {disfmarker}
Turn 1024, F (PhD): Maybe the sections that are not right afte you know , after lunch when everybody 's still munching and {disfmarker}
Turn 1025, A (PhD): So can you send out a schedule once you know it , jus ?
Turn 1026, B (Professor): OK . Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1027, A (PhD): Is {disfmarker} is there a r ?
Turn 1028, B (Professor): OK . Yeah . I guess I sent it around a little bit .
Turn 1029, A (PhD): There 's a res Is it changed now , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1030, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} I hadn't heard back from Mari after I {disfmarker} I u u uh , brought up the point abou about Andreas 's schedule . So , {vocalsound} um , maybe when I get back there 'll be {pause} some {disfmarker} some mail from her .
Turn 1031, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 1032, B (Professor): So , I 'll make a {disfmarker}
Turn 1033, C (Postdoc): I 'm looking forward to seeing your representation . That 'd be , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1034, A (PhD): And w we should get {pause} the two meetings from y
Turn 1035, C (Postdoc): I 'd like to see that . Yeah .
Turn 1036, A (PhD): I mean , I know about the first meeting , um , but the other one that you did , the NSA one , which we {pause} hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it , because the non - native speaker {disfmarker}
Turn 1037, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1038, A (PhD): there were five non - native speakers .
Turn 1039, C (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . I see . Mm - hmm .
Turn 1040, A (PhD): But , it would be useful for the {disfmarker} to see what we get {pause} with that one . So .
Turn 1041, C (Postdoc): Great . OK . It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand .
Turn 1042, A (PhD): Yeah , three . Right . So {disfmarker}
Turn 1043, C (Postdoc): Great . I sent email when I finished the {disfmarker} that one .
Turn 1044, A (PhD): N S A three , I think .
Turn 1045, C (Postdoc): That was sort of son Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . That 's much simpler .
Turn 1046, A (PhD): I don't know what they said but I know the number .
Turn 1047, B (Professor): Th - that part 's definitely gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later .
Turn 1048, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 1049, B (Professor): I mean , this is {disfmarker} we we 're recording secret NSA meetings ?
Turn 1050, F (PhD): Um . Not the {disfmarker}
Turn 1051, B (Professor): I mean , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1052, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1053, C (Postdoc): Yeah . Not that NSA .
Turn 1054, F (PhD): Uh . The {disfmarker} th the {disfmarker}
Turn 1055, A (PhD): They are hard to understand .
Turn 1056, B (Professor): It 's network services and applications .
Turn 1057, F (PhD): Wait .
Turn 1058, A (PhD): They 're very , uh , out there .
Turn 1059, F (PhD): The {disfmarker}
Turn 1060, A (PhD): I have no idea what they 're talking about .
Turn 1061, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1062, F (PhD): The , um {disfmarker} th the other good thing about the alignments is that , um , it 's not always the machine 's fault if it doesn't work . So , you can actually find , um ,
Turn 1063, A (PhD): It 's the person 's fault .
Turn 1064, F (PhD): problem {disfmarker} uh , proble
Turn 1065, A (PhD): It 's Morgan 's fault .
Turn 1066, F (PhD): You can find {disfmarker}
Turn 1067, B (Professor): It 's always Morgan 's fault .
Turn 1068, F (PhD): You can find , uh , problems with {disfmarker} with the transcripts , um , you know ,
Turn 1069, E (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1070, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1071, F (PhD): and go back and fix them .
Turn 1072, A (PhD): Tha - There are some cases like where the {disfmarker} the wrong speaker {disfmarker} uh , these ca Not a lot , but where the {disfmarker} the wrong person {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker
Turn 1073, F (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1074, A (PhD): and you can tell that when you run it . Or at least you can get {pause} clues to it .
Turn 1075, C (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 1076, A (PhD): So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals , like what you have .
Turn 1077, C (Postdoc): I guess it does w Mm - hmm . It also raises the possibility of , um , using that kind of representation {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know , this 'd be something we 'd wanna check , {comment} but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized , uh , representation , cuz it {disfmarker} I think that the {disfmarker} I mean , my {disfmarker} my preference in terms of , like , looking at the data is to see it {pause} in this kind of musical score format .
Turn 1078, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1079, C (Postdoc): And also , s you know , Sue 's preference as well .
Turn 1080, A (PhD): Yeah , if you can get it to {disfmarker}
Turn 1081, C (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but , I mean , this {disfmarker} if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too . I don't {disfmarker} I have no idea . I think this is something that would need to be checked . Yeah .
Turn 1082, B (Professor): OK . Th - the other thing I had actually was , I {disfmarker} I didn't realize this till today , but , uh , this is , uh , Jose 's last day .
Turn 1083, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1084, H (PhD): Is my last {disfmarker} my last day .
Turn 1085, A (PhD): Oh !
Turn 1086, C (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1087, F (PhD): Oh !
Turn 1088, E (Grad): You 're not gonna be here tomorrow ?
Turn 1089, H (PhD): My {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my last meeting {pause} about meetings .
Turn 1090, E (Grad): Oh , that 's right . Tomorrow {disfmarker}
Turn 1091, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1092, D (PhD): The last meeting meeting ?

Turn 1102, H (PhD): And I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to say thank you very much , eh , to all people {pause} in the group and at ICSI ,
Turn 1103, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1104, E (Grad): Yeah . It was good having you .
Turn 1105, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1106, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1107, H (PhD): because I {disfmarker} I enjoyed @ @ very much ,
Turn 1108, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1109, H (PhD): uh . And I 'm sorry by the result of overlapping , because , eh , {vocalsound} I haven't good results , eh , yet but , eh , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I pretend {comment} to {disfmarker} to continuing out to Spain , eh , during the {disfmarker} the following months ,
Turn 1110, B (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 1111, H (PhD): eh , because I have , eh , another ideas but , eh , I haven't enough time to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with six months it 's not enough to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to {disfmarker} to research ,
Turn 1112, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1113, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1114, H (PhD): eh , and e i I mean , if , eh , the topic is , eh , so difficult , uh , in my opinion , there isn't {disfmarker}
Turn 1115, B (Professor): Yeah . Maybe somebody else will come along and will be , uh , interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also , you know . They 'd make use of {disfmarker} of what you 've done .
Turn 1116, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1117, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1118, H (PhD): Yeah . But , eh , I {disfmarker} I will try to recommend , eh , at , eh , {vocalsound} the Spanish government but , eh , the following @ @ scholarship , eh , eh , {vocalsound} eh , will be here {pause} more time , because eh , i in my opinion is {disfmarker} is better , {vocalsound} eh , for us {pause} to {disfmarker} to spend more time here and to work more time i i in a topic .
Turn 1119, B (Professor): Yeah , it 's a very short time .
Turn 1120, H (PhD): No ? But , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1121, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1122, E (Grad): Yeah , six months is hard .
Turn 1123, H (PhD): Yeah . It is .
Turn 1124, E (Grad): I think a year is a lot better .
Turn 1125, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1126, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1127, H (PhD): It 's difficult . You {disfmarker} e you have , eh {disfmarker} you are lucky , and you {disfmarker} you find a solution {comment} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in some few tim uh , months , eh ? OK . But , eh , I think it 's not , eh , common . But , eh , anyway , thank you . Thank you very much . Eh , I {disfmarker} I bring the chocolate , eh , to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} to tear , uh , with {disfmarker} with you ,

Turn 1144, H (PhD): Thank you .
Turn 1145, B (Professor): Yeah . OK . I guess , uh , unless somebody has something else , we 'll read {disfmarker} read our digits
Turn 1146, E (Grad): Digits ?
Turn 1147, B (Professor): and we 'll get our {disfmarker}
Turn 1148, D (PhD): Uh .
Turn 1149, B (Professor): get our last bit of , uh , Jose 's {disfmarker} Jose {disfmarker} Jose 's digit {disfmarker}
Turn 1150, D (PhD): Oops .
Turn 1151, E (Grad): Are we gonna do them simultaneously or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1152, H (PhD): You {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker}
Turn 1153, B (Professor): Uh , I 'm sorry ?
Turn 1154, H (PhD): Ye - ye you prefer , eh , to eat , eh , chocolate , eh , at the coffee break , eh , at the {disfmarker} ? {vocalsound} Or you prefer now , before after {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1155, C (Postdoc): Well , we have a time {disfmarker}
Turn 1156, F (PhD): No , we prefer to keep it for ourselves .
Turn 1157, D (PhD): During {disfmarker}
Turn 1158, C (Postdoc): Well , we have a s a time {disfmarker} time constraint .
Turn 1159, F (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1160, D (PhD): during digits .
Turn 1161, B (Professor): So keep it away from that end of the table .
Turn 1162, C (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1163, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1164, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1165, A (PhD): Why is it that I can read your mind ?

Turn 1167, E (Grad): Well , we 've gotta wait until after di after we take the mikes off .
Turn 1168, D (PhD): No , no .
Turn 1169, E (Grad): So are we gonna do digits simultaneously
Turn 1170, A (PhD): You {disfmarker} This is our reward if we {pause} do our digi
Turn 1171, B (Professor): Well ? Yeah .
Turn 1172, C (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1173, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1174, E (Grad): or what ?
Turn 1175, D (PhD): Simultaneous digit chocolate task .
Turn 1176, H (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think , eh , it 's enough , eh , for more peopl for more people {pause} after .
Turn 1177, B (Professor): We 're gonna {disfmarker} we 're gonna do digits at the same {disfmarker}
Turn 1178, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 1179, F (PhD): Mmm !
Turn 1180, C (Postdoc): That 's nice .
Turn 1181, H (PhD): But , eh {disfmarker}

Turn 1194, B (Professor): Alright , so in the interest of getting to the {disfmarker}
Turn 1195, A (PhD): We could do digits while other people eat .
Turn 1196, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1197, A (PhD): So it 's background crunching .
Turn 1198, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1199, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1200, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1201, A (PhD): We don't have background chewing .
Turn 1202, C (Postdoc): Nice .
Turn 1203, H (PhD): Is , eh , a {disfmarker} another acoustic event .
Turn 1204, D (PhD): Background crunch . Yeah .
Turn 1205, A (PhD): No , we don't have any data with background eating .
Turn 1206, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1207, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1208, A (PhD): I 'm serious . You
Turn 1209, B (Professor): She 's {disfmarker} she 's serious .
Turn 1210, A (PhD): I am serious .
Turn 1211, E (Grad): It 's just the rest of the digits {disfmarker} the rest of the digits are very clean ,
Turn 1212, B (Professor): She is serious .
Turn 1213, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1214, A (PhD): Well {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1215, H (PhD): Are you {disfmarker} ? Oh , they 're clean .
Turn 1216, D (PhD): Yeah !
Turn 1217, E (Grad): um , without a lot of background noise ,
Turn 1218, A (PhD): And it {disfmarker} You have to write down , like , while y what you 're {disfmarker} what ch chocolate you 're eating
Turn 1219, E (Grad): so I 'm just not sure {disfmarker}
Turn 1220, A (PhD): cuz they might make different sounds , like n nuts {disfmarker} chocolate with nuts , chocolate without nuts .
Turn 1221, C (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1222, B (Professor): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 1223, D (PhD): Crunchy frogs .
Turn 1224, F (PhD): Chocolate adaptation .
Turn 1225, B (Professor): Actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} actually kind of careful cuz I have a strong allergy to nuts , so I have to sort of figure out one without th
Turn 1226, A (PhD): That w Oh , yeah , they {disfmarker} they might .
Turn 1227, B (Professor): It 's hard to {disfmarker} hard to say .
Turn 1228, A (PhD): Maybe those ? They 're so {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 1229, B (Professor): I don't know . Um {disfmarker}
Turn 1230, A (PhD): This is {disfmarker} You know , this is a different kind of speech ,

Turn 1238, B (Professor): But if I was {disfmarker} eh , but maybe I 'll get some later . Thanks .
Turn 1239, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1240, B (Professor): Well {disfmarker} well , why don't we {disfmarker} ? He {disfmarker} he 's worried about a ticket . Why don't we do a simultaneous one ?
Turn 1241, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 1242, B (Professor): Simultaneous one ?
Turn 1243, C (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1244, E (Grad): OK .

Turn 1257, B (Professor): and now I love it so much .
Turn 1258, E (Grad): OK , everyone ready ?
Turn 1259, A (PhD): You have to sort of , um {disfmarker} Jose , if you haven't done this , you have to plug your ears while you 're t talking
Turn 1260, B (Professor): W wait {disfmarker} wait a minute {disfmarker} wait a minute . W we want {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker}
Turn 1261, A (PhD): so that you don't get confused , I guess .
Turn 1262, B (Professor): we want it synchronized .
Turn 1263, A (PhD): Yeah . Oh , you 've done this one before ?
Turn 1264, C (Postdoc): Hey , you 've done this before . Haven't you ?
Turn 1265, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1266, D (PhD): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1267, A (PhD): Together ?
Turn 1268, C (Postdoc): You 've read {pause} digits together with us , haven't you {disfmarker} I mean , at the same time ?
Turn 1269, A (PhD): I 'm not {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} Oh , and you haven't done this either .

Turn 1275, A (PhD): I the first time is {pause} traumatic ,
Turn 1276, B (Professor): We
Turn 1277, A (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 1278, B (Professor): Y {vocalsound} Yeah , bu
Turn 1279, C (Postdoc): Oh , and the groupings are important ,
Turn 1280, H (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1281, C (Postdoc): so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings .
Turn 1282, H (PhD): The grouping .
Turn 1283, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1284, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1285, B (Professor): OK . So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1286, F (PhD): You mean that the {disfmarker} the grouping is supposed to be synchronized ?
Turn 1287, B (Professor): No , no .
Turn 1288, C (Postdoc): No .
Turn 1289, E (Grad): Yeah , sure .
Turn 1290, F (PhD): No ?
Turn 1291, A (PhD): That 'd be good .
Turn 1292, B (Professor): Synchronized digits .
Turn 1293, C (Postdoc): No .
Turn 1294, F (PhD): No ?
Turn 1295, A (PhD): We - we 'll give everybody the same sheet
Turn 1296, F (PhD): It 's like a {disfmarker} like a Greek {disfmarker} like a Greek choir ?
Turn 1297, A (PhD): but they say different {disfmarker}
Turn 1298, F (PhD): You know ?
Turn 1299, B (Professor): Yes .
Turn 1300, E (Grad): Hey , what a good idea .
Turn 1301, F (PhD): Like {disfmarker}
Turn 1302, E (Grad): We could do the same sheet for everyone .
Turn 1303, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1304, E (Grad): Have them all read them at once .
Turn 1305, A (PhD): Well , different digits
Turn 1306, D (PhD): Eh {disfmarker}
Turn 1307, A (PhD): but same groupings .
Turn 1308, E (Grad): Or {disfmarker} or just same digits .
Turn 1309, A (PhD): So they would all be {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 1310, C (Postdoc): Yeah . That 'd be good .
Turn 1311, E (Grad): See if anyone notices .
Turn 1312, B (Professor): There 's so many possibilities .
Turn 1313, C (Postdoc): And then {disfmarker} then we can sing them next time .
Turn 1314, B (Professor): Uh . OK , why don't we go ? Uh , one two three {disfmarker} Go !
Turn 1315, C (Postdoc): OK . Mmm !
Turn 1316, B (Professor): And Andreas has the last word .
Turn 1317, E (Grad): Did you read it twice or what ?
Turn 1318, A (PhD): He 's try No , he 's trying to get good recognition performance .
Turn 1319, C (Postdoc): He had the h
Turn 1320, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1321, C (Postdoc): He had the {disfmarker} the long form .
Turn 1322, H (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1323, E (Grad): And we 're off .
Turn 1324, F (PhD): No .
