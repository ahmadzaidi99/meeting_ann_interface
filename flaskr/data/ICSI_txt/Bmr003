Turn 0, A (Grad): OK , this is one channel . Can you uh , say your name and talk into your mike one at a time ?
Turn 1, C (PhD): This is Eric on channel three , I believe .
Turn 2, A (Grad): OK . Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane .
Turn 3, D (Undergrad): Tasting one two three , tasting .
Turn 4, E (Postdoc): OK , this is Jane on channel five .
Turn 5, A (Grad): Uh , I still don't see you Jane .
Turn 6, E (Postdoc): Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ?
Turn 7, D (Undergrad): Can you see me on channel four ? Really ?
Turn 8, A (Grad): Yeah , I s
Turn 9, D (Undergrad): My lucky day .
Turn 10, E (Postdoc): Uh , screen no , {disfmarker} it is , oh , maybe it just warmed up ?
Turn 11, A (Grad): No .
Turn 12, E (Postdoc): Oh , darn , can you can't see channel five yet ?
Turn 13, A (Grad): Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth , so .
Turn 14, E (Postdoc): Oh , this would be k OK , is that better ?
Turn 15, A (Grad): S uh , try speaking loudly ,
Turn 16, D (Undergrad): I like the high quality labelling .
Turn 17, A (Grad): so ,
Turn 18, E (Postdoc): Hello ,
Turn 19, A (Grad): OK , good .
Turn 20, D (Undergrad): David , can we borrow your labelling machine to improve the quality of the labelling a little bit here ?
Turn 21, E (Postdoc): hello . Alright .
Turn 22, A (Grad): Thank you .
Turn 23, B (PhD): One t
Turn 24, D (Undergrad): How {disfmarker} how many are there , one to five ?
Turn 25, B (PhD): One five , yeah .
Turn 26, D (Undergrad): Yeah , please .
Turn 27, E (Postdoc): Would you like to join the meeting ?
Turn 28, A (Grad): Well , we don't wanna renumber them ,
Turn 29, E (Postdoc): I bet {disfmarker}
Turn 30, A (Grad): cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them . So , let 's keep the same numbers on them .
Turn 31, B (PhD): Yeah , OK , that 's a good idea .
Turn 32, A (Grad): OK , Dan , are you on ?
Turn 33, B (PhD): I 'm on {disfmarker} I 'm on two and I should be on .
Turn 34, A (Grad): Good .
Turn 35, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 36, D (Undergrad): Want to join the meeting , Dave ? Do we {disfmarker} do {disfmarker} do we have a spare , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 37, A (Grad): And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones , so I assume {pause} the various and assorted P Z Ms are on .
Turn 38, D (Undergrad): We ' r we 're {disfmarker} we ' r This is {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this is a meeting meeting .
Turn 39, E (Postdoc): This is abou we 're {disfmarker} we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , uh , transcription for the m future meeting meetings .
Turn 40, A (Grad): Stuff . Yeah , this is not something you need to attend . So .
Turn 41, E (Postdoc): Yeah . e OK .
Turn 42, C (PhD): You 're always having one of those days , Dave .
Turn 43, E (Postdoc): Y you 'd be welcome .
Turn 44, A (Grad): Besides , I don't want anyone who has a weird accent .
Turn 45, E (Postdoc): You 'd be welcome .
Turn 46, A (Grad): Right , Dan ?
Turn 47, D (Undergrad): So , I don't understand if it 's neck mounted you don't get very good performance .
Turn 48, C (PhD): It 's not neck mounted . It 's supposed to be h head mounted .
Turn 49, D (Undergrad): Yeah . It {disfmarker} it should be head mounted . Right ?
Turn 50, A (Grad): Well , then put it on your head .
Turn 51, B (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 52, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 53, A (Grad): What are you doing ?
Turn 54, D (Undergrad): Cuz when you do this , you can {disfmarker} Rouww - Rouww .
Turn 55, E (Postdoc): Why didn't I {disfmarker} you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the {disfmarker} on the transcription {disfmarker} on the , uh , tape .
Turn 56, A (Grad): Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head
Turn 57, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 58, C (PhD): i
Turn 59, A (Grad): but they were complaining about it . Because it 's not {disfmarker} it doesn't go over the ears .
Turn 60, D (Undergrad): Why ?
Turn 61, E (Postdoc): It 's badly designed .
Turn 62, A (Grad): It 's very badly designed so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 63, B (PhD): It 's very badly designed ?
Turn 64, D (Undergrad): What do you mean it doesn't go over the ears ?
Turn 65, B (PhD): Why ? It 's not s It 's not supposed to cover up your ears .
Turn 66, A (Grad): Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable .
Turn 67, B (PhD): I mean , it 's only badly {disfmarker}
Turn 68, E (Postdoc): So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation .
Turn 69, B (PhD): Oh , that 's strange .
Turn 70, C (PhD): Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} that 's what I have .
Turn 71, A (Grad): And it feels so good that way .
Turn 72, C (PhD): It feels so good when I stop .
Turn 73, A (Grad): So I {disfmarker} I again would like to do some digits .
Turn 74, D (Undergrad): Somebody wanna {disfmarker}
Turn 75, E (Postdoc): Try it .
Turn 76, A (Grad): Um .
Turn 77, D (Undergrad): Somebody wanna close the door ?
Turn 78, A (Grad): Sure .
Turn 79, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 80, E (Postdoc): We could do it with noise .
Turn 81, A (Grad): So let me {disfmarker}
Turn 82, C (PhD): You 're always doing digits .
Turn 83, A (Grad): Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of {disfmarker} digit - y g sorta guy . OK . So this is Adam .
Turn 84, E (Postdoc): Uh , this is the same one I had before .
Turn 85, A (Grad): I doubt it .
Turn 86, B (PhD): It 's still the same words .
Turn 87, A (Grad): I think we 're session four by the way . Or m it might be five .
Turn 88, D (Undergrad): Psss ! Oh , that 's good .
Turn 89, E (Postdoc): No
Turn 90, A (Grad): I didn't bring my previous thing .
Turn 91, B (PhD): We didn't {disfmarker}
Turn 92, E (Postdoc): Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ?
Turn 93, B (PhD): That 's the microphone number .
Turn 94, E (Postdoc): That 's the microphone number .
Turn 95, A (Grad): Yeah , d leave the channel blank .
Turn 96, E (Postdoc): Uh - oh . OK , good .
Turn 97, D (Undergrad): But number has to be {disfmarker} ? So we have to look up the number .
Turn 98, E (Postdoc): Five {disfmarker}
Turn 99, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 100, D (Undergrad): OK , good .
Turn 101, E (Postdoc): Good . OK . Well , this is Jane , on mike number five . Um . I just start ? Do I need to say anything more ?
Turn 102, A (Grad): Uh , transcript number .
Turn 103, B (PhD): Transcript number {disfmarker}
Turn 104, C (PhD): OK , this is Eric on microphone number three ,
Turn 105, D (Undergrad): This is Beck on mike four .
Turn 106, A (Grad): Thanks . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ?
Turn 107, B (PhD): Oh , God . No , let me do it .
Turn 108, A (Grad): Why ? Are you gonna do something other than hit " quit " ?
Turn 109, B (PhD): No , but I 'm gonna look at the uh , logs as well .
Turn 110, A (Grad): Oh . Should have done it before .
Turn 111, E (Postdoc): Uh , you said turn off the what ?
Turn 112, A (Grad): The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the act of recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors .
Turn 113, E (Postdoc): Oh . Oh , I see .
Turn 114, D (Undergrad): Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ?
Turn 115, E (Postdoc): I See .
Turn 116, A (Grad): That was me ,
Turn 117, D (Undergrad): Oh , I 'm sorry y
Turn 118, A (Grad): I thought that was {disfmarker}
Turn 119, D (Undergrad): That was malarkey .
Turn 120, A (Grad): Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug . Right ? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded .
Turn 121, D (Undergrad): No chance of that .
Turn 122, A (Grad): No chance of that . Just because it 's beta . Look OK ?
Turn 123, B (PhD): Yeah , there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} there was a {disfmarker} there was a bug . There was a glitch last time we ran .
Turn 124, D (Undergrad): Are - are yo are you recording where the table mikes are by the way ?
Turn 125, B (PhD): No .
Turn 126, D (Undergrad): Do you know which channels {disfmarker}
Turn 127, A (Grad): Yeah , we usually do that .
Turn 128, B (PhD): No , we don't .
Turn 129, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 130, B (PhD): But we {disfmarker} we ought to st we ought to standardize .
Turn 131, D (Undergrad): Why not ?
Turn 132, B (PhD): I think , {vocalsound} uh , I s I spoke to somebody , Morgan , {comment} about that . I think {disfmarker} I think we should put mar Well , no , w we can do that .
Turn 133, D (Undergrad): Why don't you just do this ?
Turn 134, A (Grad): I mean , that 's what we 've done before .
Turn 135, B (PhD): I know what they {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're four , three , two , one . In order now .
Turn 136, D (Undergrad): Four .
Turn 137, B (PhD): Three , two , {vocalsound} and one .
Turn 138, D (Undergrad): Three .
Turn 139, B (PhD): But I think {disfmarker} I think we should put them in standard positions . I think we should make little marks on the table top .
Turn 140, A (Grad): Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things .
Turn 141, B (PhD): So that we can put them {disfmarker}
Turn 142, E (Postdoc): Oh , OK .
Turn 143, B (PhD): I guess that 's the point .
Turn 144, A (Grad): So .
Turn 145, B (PhD): It 'll be a lot easier if we have a {disfmarker} if we have them permanently in place or something like that .
Turn 146, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 147, E (Postdoc): I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling .
Turn 148, B (PhD): You do ?
Turn 149, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 150, C (PhD): Would it make you feel more important ?
Turn 151, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 152, E (Postdoc): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 153, C (PhD): I see .
Turn 154, D (Undergrad): Wait till the projector gets installed .
Turn 155, E (Postdoc): You know .
Turn 156, A (Grad): That 'll work .
Turn 157, E (Postdoc): Oh , that 'll be good .
Turn 158, A (Grad): That 'll work .
Turn 159, B (PhD): Oh , gosh .
Turn 160, D (Undergrad): Cuz it 's gonna hang down , make noise .
Turn 161, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 162, B (PhD): When 's it gonna be installed ?
Turn 163, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 164, D (Undergrad): Well , {vocalsound} it depends on
Turn 165, B (PhD): I see .
Turn 166, D (Undergrad): Is this b is this being recorded ?
Turn 167, A (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 168, D (Undergrad): Uh , I think Lila actually is almost getting r pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order .
Turn 169, B (PhD): OK . Cool .
Turn 170, D (Undergrad): I handed it off to her about a month ago .
Turn 171, B (PhD): I see .
Turn 172, A (Grad): OK , so , topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription . Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription . Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that and then get an update on the electronics , and then , uh , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on . Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we 're gonna {disfmarker} how we 're gonna handle some of these factors . So .
Turn 173, B (PhD): Distribute what ?
Turn 174, A (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 175, B (PhD): The data ?
Turn 176, A (Grad): Right . Right . I mean , so we 're {disfmarker} we 're collecting a corpus and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is {disfmarker} uh , has been done before . And so I think people will be interested in having {disfmarker} having it ,
Turn 177, B (PhD): Oh .
Turn 178, A (Grad): and so we will {disfmarker}
Turn 179, D (Undergrad): u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ?
Turn 180, A (Grad): Excuse me ?
Turn 181, B (PhD): Yes .
Turn 182, D (Undergrad): Audio D V
Turn 183, A (Grad): Well , or something . Yeah , audio D V C Ds ,
Turn 184, D (Undergrad): Or t
Turn 185, A (Grad): you know .
Turn 186, D (Undergrad): Yeah . tapes .
Turn 187, A (Grad): And {disfmarker} and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we {disfmarker} how do we just do all that infrastructure ?
Turn 188, C (PhD): Well , I think {disfmarker} I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to {disfmarker} to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance .
Turn 189, E (Postdoc): Yeah ,
Turn 190, A (Grad): Right , but {disfmarker} but so should we do it in the same format as LDC
Turn 191, E (Postdoc): that 's right .
Turn 192, A (Grad): and what does that mean to what we 've done already ?
Turn 193, B (PhD): Right . The {disfmarker} It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to {pause} preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution .
Turn 194, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 195, A (Grad): Right . So , uh , as it is , it 's sort of a {pause} ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal . So .
Turn 196, B (PhD): And the other thing is that , um , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well ,
Turn 197, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 198, B (PhD): in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy .
Turn 199, A (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 200, D (Undergrad): A field trip .
Turn 201, A (Grad): Yeah . I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . That would be kind of fun .
Turn 202, B (PhD): Oh , really ?
Turn 203, A (Grad): Yeah . Visit my friends and spend some time {disfmarker}
Turn 204, B (PhD): Different for you . Yes .
Turn 205, A (Grad): Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out {vocalsound} and align where the digits are . And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well .
Turn 206, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 207, A (Grad): And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard .
Turn 208, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 209, A (Grad): You know , STM files , or XML , or something .
Turn 210, D (Undergrad): An - and there 's interest up there ?
Turn 211, A (Grad): What 's that ?
Turn 212, D (Undergrad): There 's interest up there ?
Turn 213, A (Grad): Well they {disfmarker} they certainly wanna collect more data . And so they 're applying , I think I B Is that right ? Something like that .
Turn 214, B (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 215, A (Grad): Um , for some more money to do more data . So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings . They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours . So , they want a very large data set . Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money . So .
Turn 216, B (PhD): I see .
Turn 217, A (Grad): And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room . I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well ,
Turn 218, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 219, A (Grad): the {disfmarker} the acoustics of this room .
Turn 220, B (PhD): All about that .
Turn 221, D (Undergrad): Including the fan .
Turn 222, A (Grad): Including the fan .
Turn 223, D (Undergrad): Did you notice the fan difference ?
Turn 224, B (PhD): Oh , now you 've touched the fan control , now all our data 's gonna be {disfmarker}
Turn 225, D (Undergrad): Hear the difference ?
Turn 226, A (Grad): Oh , it 's enormous .
Turn 227, B (PhD): Yeah , it 's great .
Turn 228, E (Postdoc): Oh , that 's better .
Turn 229, D (Undergrad): Do you wanna leave it off or not ?
Turn 230, E (Postdoc): That 's better .
Turn 231, A (Grad): All the others have been on .
Turn 232, B (PhD): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 233, D (Undergrad): Yeah , the {disfmarker} You sure ?
Turn 234, B (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 235, A (Grad): y Absolut
Turn 236, B (PhD): Absolutely .
Turn 237, D (Undergrad): You {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You think that {disfmarker}
Turn 238, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 239, D (Undergrad): things after the f then This fan 's wired backwards by the way . Uh , I think this is high speed here .
Turn 240, E (Postdoc): Yeah , it 's noticeable .
Turn 241, D (Undergrad): Well , not clear .
Turn 242, B (PhD): Well it 's {disfmarker} well like {vocalsound} " low " is mid {disfmarker} mid - scale .
Turn 243, D (Undergrad): Maybe it {disfmarker} Maybe it isn't .
Turn 244, B (PhD): So it could be {vocalsound} that it 's not actually wired backwards
Turn 245, D (Undergrad): That 's right .
Turn 246, B (PhD): it 's just that ambiguous .
Turn 247, D (Undergrad): I was wondering also , Get ready . {comment} whether the lights made any noise .
Turn 248, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 249, A (Grad): There 's definitely {disfmarker} Yep .
Turn 250, B (PhD): Oh , they do .
Turn 251, C (PhD): Yeah , a little bit .
Turn 252, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 253, A (Grad): High pitch hum . Wow .
Turn 254, D (Undergrad): So , {vocalsound} do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future .
Turn 255, A (Grad): Yeah , just get a variety .
Turn 256, E (Postdoc): I think candles would be nice if they don't make noise .
Turn 257, A (Grad): They 're very good .
Turn 258, B (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 259, C (PhD): It would {disfmarker} you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you {vocalsound} turn off the {disfmarker} {comment} turn off the air conditioning ,
Turn 260, A (Grad): Carbon monoxide poisoning ?
Turn 261, D (Undergrad): Short meetings , that 's right . Or {disfmarker} Yeah , sort of {comment} r r
Turn 262, C (PhD): got to finish this meeting .
Turn 263, D (Undergrad): Tear t {pause} Tear your clothing off to stay cool .
Turn 264, C (PhD): That 's right .
Turn 265, D (Undergrad): Actually , the a th air {disfmarker} the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan .
Turn 266, C (PhD): Right , I see .
Turn 267, A (Grad): So
Turn 268, C (PhD): So , um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara .
Turn 269, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I saw it . I 've been watching for that corpus .
Turn 270, C (PhD): Um , of general spoken English .
Turn 271, E (Postdoc): Yeah . Yep .
Turn 272, C (PhD): And I don't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there 's a lot of different {vocalsound} styles of speech and what not .
Turn 273, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 274, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 275, E (Postdoc): They had people come in to a certain degree and they {disfmarker} and they have DAT recorders .
Turn 276, C (PhD): I see . So it is sort of far field stuff . Right ?
Turn 277, E (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I assume so , actually , I hadn't thought about that . Unless they added close field later on but , um , I 've listened to some of those data and I , um , I 've been {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up .
Turn 278, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 279, C (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 280, B (PhD): What 's it sound like ?
Turn 281, E (Postdoc): I 'm glad to see that it got released .
Turn 282, A (Grad): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I wish {disfmarker}
Turn 283, E (Postdoc): So it it 's a very nice thing .
Turn 284, A (Grad): I wish we had someone here working on adaptation
Turn 285, C (PhD): S
Turn 286, A (Grad): because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . You know {disfmarker}
Turn 287, C (PhD): But it may be {disfmarker} it may be useful in {disfmarker}
Turn 288, E (Postdoc): How do you mean {disfmarker} do you mean mechanical adaptation or {disfmarker}
Turn 289, A (Grad): No , software , to adapt the speech recognition .
Turn 290, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 291, C (PhD): Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff ,
Turn 292, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 293, C (PhD): right ? In doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data
Turn 294, E (Postdoc): Great idea .
Turn 295, C (PhD): because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far .
Turn 296, A (Grad): That 's true .
Turn 297, E (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and their recording conditions are really clean . I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I 've heard {disfmarker} I 've listened to the data .
Turn 298, A (Grad): Well that 's not good , right ?
Turn 299, C (PhD): That 's {disfmarker} that 's not great .
Turn 300, E (Postdoc): It sounds {disfmarker}
Turn 301, D (Undergrad): Tr
Turn 302, E (Postdoc): well but what I mean is that , um {disfmarker}
Turn 303, D (Undergrad): But far field means great distance ? I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 304, A (Grad): Just these .
Turn 305, D (Undergrad): Not head mounted ?
Turn 306, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 307, D (Undergrad): And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple DATs ?
Turn 308, E (Postdoc): Um , oh , good question and I can't ans answer it .
Turn 309, A (Grad): Well we can look into it .
Turn 310, E (Postdoc): I don't know .
Turn 311, C (PhD): No , and their web {disfmarker} their web page didn't answer it either . So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them .
Turn 312, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 313, C (PhD): So it 's {disfmarker} that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . But .
Turn 314, A (Grad): So we can get that just with , uh , media costs ,
Turn 315, D (Undergrad): Still a point .
Turn 316, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 317, A (Grad): is that right ?
Turn 318, C (PhD): Uh , in fact we get it for free
Turn 319, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 320, C (PhD): cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC .
Turn 321, A (Grad): Great .
Turn 322, E (Postdoc): Yep .
Turn 323, A (Grad): So that would be {disfmarker} yeah , that would be something to look into . So .
Turn 324, C (PhD): So , I can {disfmarker} I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're {disfmarker}
Turn 325, E (Postdoc): The other thing too is from {disfmarker} from a {disfmarker}
Turn 326, A (Grad): Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to think about it a little bit .
Turn 327, C (PhD): Huh .
Turn 328, E (Postdoc): The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in {disfmarker} in the discourse domain . But they also mentioned that they have it time aligned . I mean , I s I {disfmarker} I saw that write - up .
Turn 329, C (PhD): Yeah . Maybe we should {disfmarker} maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did
Turn 330, B (PhD): Yeah , absolutely .
Turn 331, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 332, C (PhD): so {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} we can compare .
Turn 333, E (Postdoc): It 's very nice .
Turn 334, A (Grad): OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ?
Turn 335, B (PhD): Absolutely .
Turn 336, C (PhD): Alright , I 'll do that . I can't remember the name of the corpus . It 's Corps - S {disfmarker}
Turn 337, E (Postdoc): CSAE .
Turn 338, C (PhD): S {disfmarker}
Turn 339, E (Postdoc): Corpus of Spoken American English .
Turn 340, C (PhD): Right , OK .
Turn 341, E (Postdoc): Yeah , sp I 've been {disfmarker} I was really pleased to see that . I knew that they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they had had some funding problems in completing it
Turn 342, B (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 343, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 344, E (Postdoc): but , um ,
Turn 345, C (PhD): Well they 're {disfmarker}
Turn 346, E (Postdoc): this is clever .
Turn 347, C (PhD): Apparently this was like phase one
Turn 348, E (Postdoc): Got it through the LDC .
Turn 349, C (PhD): and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues
Turn 350, E (Postdoc): Great . Great .
Turn 351, C (PhD): and then then it ma they may not do phase two but {vocalsound} from all the web documentation it looked like , " oh , this is phase one " , whatever that means .
Turn 352, E (Postdoc): Super . Super . Great . Yeah , that {disfmarker} I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area ,
Turn 353, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 354, E (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} So this is a very good corpus .
Turn 355, C (PhD): But , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then ,
Turn 356, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 357, C (PhD): you know {disfmarker} So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her .
Turn 358, A (Grad): Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked .
Turn 359, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 360, C (PhD): Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting .
Turn 361, B (PhD): Sure , of course .
Turn 362, D (Undergrad): That would be a meeting meeting meeting ?
Turn 363, A (Grad): A meeting meeting meeting .
Turn 364, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 365, A (Grad): Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting . So .
Turn 366, C (PhD): Oh .
Turn 367, A (Grad): Um .
Turn 368, C (PhD): Right . But maybe we should , uh find some day that Liz {disfmarker} uh , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often .
Turn 369, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 370, C (PhD): So maybe we should find a day when they 're gonna be here and {disfmarker} and Morgan 's gonna be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . I mean , not necessarily have the U - dub people down .
Turn 371, A (Grad): Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub {disfmarker} to see {disfmarker}
Turn 372, C (PhD): We need {disfmarker} we need to talk to them some more .
Turn 373, A (Grad): you know , say " this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription " , if nothing else . So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ?
Turn 374, B (PhD): Mm - hmm . Let 's .
Turn 375, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 376, A (Grad): OK , so {comment} {vocalsound} since that 's what we 're talking about . What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called " Transcriber " that seems to work very well . Um , so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface and , uh ,
Turn 377, D (Undergrad): Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ?
Turn 378, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 379, D (Undergrad): And this requires humans just like the {disfmarker} the STP stuff .
Turn 380, A (Grad): Yes , yeah . Right , right . So we 're {disfmarker} we 're at this point only looking for word level . So all {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it , and identify the speaker . And so the things we {disfmarker} that we know {disfmarker} that I know I want are {vocalsound} the text , the start and end , and the speaker . But other people are interested in for example stress marking . And so Jane is doing primary stress , {vocalsound} um , stress marks as well . Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , {vocalsound} filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , {vocalsound} we have to decide how much of that we wanna do .
Turn 381, E (Postdoc): I did include a glo {comment} uh , a certain first pass . My {disfmarker} my view on it was when you have a repair {vocalsound} then , uh {disfmarker} it seems {disfmarker} I mean , we saw , there was this presentation in the {disfmarker} one of the speech group meetings about how {disfmarker}
Turn 382, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 383, E (Postdoc): and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that , that it , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that you get it bracketed in terms of like {disfmarker} well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} y y you 'll have different prosodic aspects .
Turn 384, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 385, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 386, E (Postdoc): And then also {vocalsound} if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're {disfmarker} like what I just did , {vocalsound} then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance , the start to be to the finish . And , uh , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part {disfmarker} and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . Anyway , {vocalsound} so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't uh , very time - consuming .
Turn 387, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 388, D (Undergrad): I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? Or is it real {disfmarker} is that what we 're talking about here ?
Turn 389, A (Grad): Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour ,
Turn 390, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 391, A (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 392, E (Postdoc): As a pilot study .
Turn 393, D (Undergrad): Yourself ?
Turn 394, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 395, D (Undergrad): It {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is like five times real time or ten times real time {disfmarker}
Turn 396, E (Postdoc): Yeah , as a pilot study .
Turn 397, A (Grad): Ten times about , is {disfmarker} and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? So .
Turn 398, D (Undergrad): And so you make Jane do the first one so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff , just the words are fine .
Turn 399, E (Postdoc): That 's right , that 's right .
Turn 400, B (PhD): That 's right .
Turn 401, E (Postdoc): I wanna hear about these {disfmarker} uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s
Turn 402, A (Grad): R right , so {disfmarker} so one {disfmarker} one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . And apparently that 's happened in the past . And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . Um , it will require a post pass , I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one . And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive .
Turn 403, D (Undergrad): Can't we get Joy to do it all ?
Turn 404, A (Grad): Yeah right .
Turn 405, E (Postdoc): No , {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 406, A (Grad): We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything .
Turn 407, D (Undergrad): Is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ? Yeah , that 's right .
Turn 408, A (Grad): But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who {disfmarker} who need money
Turn 409, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 410, A (Grad): and , uh , duh , again o
Turn 411, E (Postdoc): I object to that characterization !
Turn 412, B (PhD): Oh , really .
Turn 413, A (Grad): I meant Joy . And so again , I have to say " are we recording "
Turn 414, E (Postdoc): Oh , thank you . OK .
Turn 415, A (Grad): and then say , uh , Morgan has {disfmarker} has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have .
Turn 416, D (Undergrad): Right . Well , the answer is zero .
Turn 417, A (Grad): So .
Turn 418, D (Undergrad): There 's a reason why he 's resisted .
Turn 419, A (Grad): Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription .
Turn 420, D (Undergrad): But .
Turn 421, A (Grad): I mean , cuz we 're {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Turn 422, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 423, B (PhD): I have such a hard name .
Turn 424, A (Grad): I mean , I {disfmarker} I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . Right ?
Turn 425, D (Undergrad): Well , we already {disfmarker} we already {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We already have a plan in place for the first meeting .
Turn 426, A (Grad): N right .
Turn 427, D (Undergrad): Right ? That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 428, E (Postdoc): Well th there is als Yeah , really . There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , {vocalsound} you can {disfmarker} you could get people to {disfmarker} to um , to do it in exchange .
Turn 429, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 430, D (Undergrad): Well , i b but seriously , I {disfmarker} I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money .
Turn 431, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 432, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 433, D (Undergrad): And that 's {disfmarker} that 's the best we can do .
Turn 434, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 435, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 436, D (Undergrad): i b To not do anything until we get money is {disfmarker} is ridiculous .
Turn 437, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 438, D (Undergrad): We 're not gonna do any {disfmarker} get anything done if we do that .
Turn 439, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 440, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 441, A (Grad): So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at {disfmarker} is that right ? Talking to people about that ?
Turn 442, E (Postdoc): I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet .
Turn 443, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 444, E (Postdoc): I should 've sent email and I haven't yet .
Turn 445, A (Grad): Yeah , right . So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 446, D (Undergrad): I d do {disfmarker} So until you actually {vocalsound} have a little experience with what this {disfmarker} this French thing does we don't even have {disfmarker}
Turn 447, E (Postdoc): And I do have {disfmarker}
Turn 448, A (Grad): She 's already done quite a bit .
Turn 449, D (Undergrad): Oh , we have .
Turn 450, E (Postdoc): I have {disfmarker} a bunch of hours ,
Turn 451, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 452, D (Undergrad): I 'm sorry . So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ?
Turn 453, E (Postdoc): yeah .
Turn 454, D (Undergrad): Or is that really just a guess ?
Turn 455, E (Postdoc): Actually that 's the {disfmarker} the one people usually use , ten X .
Turn 456, C (PhD): How fast are you ?
Turn 457, E (Postdoc): And I haven't really calculated {disfmarker} How fast am I ?
Turn 458, D (Undergrad): Yeah i
Turn 459, E (Postdoc): I haven't done a s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that {disfmarker} that are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , and {disfmarker} and stuff like , you know , how much {disfmarker}
Turn 460, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 461, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 462, E (Postdoc): There 's some interesting human factors problems like , {vocalsound} yeah , what span of {disfmarker} of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly .
Turn 463, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 464, E (Postdoc): Cuz then , you know , you get like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you get a span of five words , that 's easy .
Turn 465, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 466, E (Postdoc): But then you have to take the time to mark it . And then there 's the issue of {vocalsound} it 's easier to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of {vocalsound} somewhere in the middle ,
Turn 467, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 468, E (Postdoc): cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever and {disfmarker} And so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take .
Turn 469, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 470, D (Undergrad): D does uh {disfmarker} this tool you 're using is strictly {disfmarker} it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ?
Turn 471, A (Grad): No .
Turn 472, E (Postdoc): No , it doesn't but what a super tool . It 's a great environment .
Turn 473, D (Undergrad): But {disfmarker} but is there anyway to {disfmarker} to wire a speech recognizer up to it and actually run it through {disfmarker}
Turn 474, E (Postdoc): That 's an interesting idea .
Turn 475, A (Grad): We 've {disfmarker} we 've thought about doing that
Turn 476, E (Postdoc): Hey !
Turn 477, A (Grad): but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous .
Turn 478, D (Undergrad): Well , a couple things .
Turn 479, B (PhD): Wow .
Turn 480, D (Undergrad): First of all the time marking you 'd get {disfmarker} you could get by a tool .
Turn 481, B (PhD): That 's true .
Turn 482, D (Undergrad): And so if the {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if the issue really
Turn 483, E (Postdoc): That 's interesting .
Turn 484, D (Undergrad): uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on {disfmarker} on live news casts .
Turn 485, A (Grad): Most of those are done by a person .
Turn 486, D (Undergrad): You know , yo I know {disfmarker} I know that .
Turn 487, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I
Turn 488, D (Undergrad): No , I understand . And {disfmarker} in a lot of them you see typos and things like that ,
Turn 489, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 490, D (Undergrad): but it {disfmarker} but it occurs to me that {vocalsound} it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is .
Turn 491, A (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , we {disfmarker}
Turn 492, D (Undergrad): But if {disfmarker} if there was a way to merge the two {disfmarker}
Turn 493, C (PhD): Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right {disfmarker}
Turn 494, A (Grad): I mean , we 've talked about it
Turn 495, E (Postdoc): That 'd be fun .
Turn 496, A (Grad): but {disfmarker}
Turn 497, C (PhD): I mean , it depends on the error rate , right ?
Turn 498, D (Undergrad): Well s but {disfmarker} but again the timing is for fr should be for free . The timing should be {disfmarker}
Turn 499, C (PhD): But we don't care about the timing of the words .
Turn 500, D (Undergrad): Well I thought you just {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} said that was a critical issue .
Turn 501, A (Grad): We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances .
Turn 502, E (Postdoc): No , uh the {disfmarker} the boundary {disfmarker}
Turn 503, C (PhD): We cut it s s
Turn 504, B (PhD): We don't {disfmarker} we don't know , actually .
Turn 505, E (Postdoc): boundary .
Turn 506, B (PhD): We haven't decided which {disfmarker} which time we care about , and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have the option to put in more or less timing data {disfmarker} and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , {vocalsound} we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is .
Turn 507, A (Grad): Yeah , so {disfmarker} so what {disfmarker} what she 's done so far , is sort of {disfmarker} more or less breath g not breath groups , {comment} sort of phrases , continuous phrases .
Turn 508, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 509, A (Grad): And so , um , that 's nice because you {disfmarker} you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end . So that seems to work really well .
Turn 510, E (Postdoc): That 's ideal .
Turn 511, A (Grad): Um .
Turn 512, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 513, E (Postdoc): Although I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , {vocalsound} recently was , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time {disfmarker} i t pre - marked cuz it does take time to put those markings in .
Turn 514, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 515, E (Postdoc): It 's really the i the interface is wonderful because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , {vocalsound} and then you press the return key . But then , you know , it 's like , {vocalsound} uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key
Turn 516, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 517, E (Postdoc): so it 's slightly delayed , so then you {disfmarker} you listen to it a second time and move it over to here .
Turn 518, D (Undergrad): a
Turn 519, E (Postdoc): So that takes time .
Turn 520, D (Undergrad): i a
Turn 521, E (Postdoc): Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , {vocalsound} l you know , good {disfmarker}
Turn 522, D (Undergrad): ar but
Turn 523, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 524, D (Undergrad): Are {disfmarker} are those d delays adjustable ? Those delays adjustable ? See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces {vocalsound} understand that delay ,
Turn 525, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 526, D (Undergrad): and {disfmarker} and so when you {disfmarker} by the time you click it it 'll be right on because it 'll go back in time to put the {disfmarker}
Turn 527, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 528, B (PhD): It could do that
Turn 529, E (Postdoc): Yeah , uh , not in this case .
Turn 530, A (Grad): We could program that pretty easily ,
Turn 531, B (PhD): couldn't it .
Turn 532, E (Postdoc): It has other {disfmarker}
Turn 533, A (Grad): couldn't we Dan ? Yeah , mis Mister TCL ?
Turn 534, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 535, E (Postdoc): Oh , interesting point .
Turn 536, B (PhD): I would have thought so , yeah .
Turn 537, E (Postdoc): Ah ! {comment} Interesting point .
Turn 538, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 539, E (Postdoc): OK , that would make a difference .
Turn 540, A (Grad): But , um {disfmarker}
Turn 541, E (Postdoc): I mean , it 's not bad
Turn 542, A (Grad): But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID .
Turn 543, E (Postdoc): but it does {disfmarker} take twice .
Turn 544, A (Grad): I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change .
Turn 545, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah , but {disfmarker}
Turn 546, A (Grad): But that would be {disfmarker}
Turn 547, B (PhD): But we 've got {disfmarker} we 've got the most channel data . We 'd have to do it from your signal . Right . I mean , we 've {disfmarker} we 've got {disfmarker} we 've got a lot of data .
Turn 548, E (Postdoc): Oh , good point ! Ah !
Turn 549, A (Grad): Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it .
Turn 550, E (Postdoc): We 've got volume .
Turn 551, B (PhD): Right . but the chances are if we if we 're talking about collecting {vocalsound} ten or a hundred hours , which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe {disfmarker}
Turn 552, D (Undergrad): If {disfmarker}
Turn 553, A (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 554, D (Undergrad): if we can go from ten X to five X we 're doing a big {disfmarker}
Turn 555, A (Grad): We 're gonna need {disfmarker} we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to {disfmarker} to do all this anyway .
Turn 556, C (PhD): Right . So maybe {disfmarker}
Turn 557, E (Postdoc): Wow .
Turn 558, B (PhD): If we 're just doing silence detection {disfmarker}
Turn 559, E (Postdoc): But {disfmarker} but it op
Turn 560, A (Grad): I knew you were gonna do that . Just saw it coming .
Turn 561, E (Postdoc): I 'm sorry . I wish you had told me {disfmarker} wish you 'd told me .
Turn 562, D (Undergrad): Put {disfmarker} put it on your sweater .
Turn 563, E (Postdoc): At what part ? OK , I 'm alright .
Turn 564, B (PhD): Um , i it seems like {disfmarker} Well , uh , I don't know . Yeah . I mean , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's maybe like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a week 's work to get to do something like this . So forty or fifty hours .
Turn 565, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 566, E (Postdoc): Could you get it so that with {disfmarker} so it would {disfmarker} it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? And the {disfmarker} the format 's really transparent .
Turn 567, B (PhD): Sure .
Turn 568, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 569, E (Postdoc): It 's just a matter of {vocalsound} a very c clear {disfmarker} it 's XML , isn't it ?
Turn 570, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 571, E (Postdoc): It 's very {disfmarker} I mean , I looked at the {disfmarker} the file format and it 's just {disfmarker} it has a t a time {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other .
Turn 572, C (PhD): So maybe {disfmarker} maybe we could try the following experiment . Take the data that you 've already transcribed
Turn 573, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 574, C (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 575, D (Undergrad): Is this already in the past or already in the future ?
Turn 576, C (PhD): Already in the past .
Turn 577, D (Undergrad): You 've already {disfmarker} you 've already done some ?
Turn 578, A (Grad): She 's {disfmarker} she 's done about half a meeting .
Turn 579, C (PhD): She {disfmarker} she 's done one {disfmarker} she 's one {disfmarker}
Turn 580, E (Postdoc): Yes I have .
Turn 581, D (Undergrad): Oh - Oh , I see .
Turn 582, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 583, D (Undergrad): OK ,
Turn 584, A (Grad): Right ?
Turn 585, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 586, D (Undergrad): good .
Turn 587, A (Grad): About half ?
Turn 588, C (PhD): I 'm go
Turn 589, E (Postdoc): S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much but anyway , enough to work with .
Turn 590, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 591, B (PhD): Several minutes .
Turn 592, C (PhD): Um , and {disfmarker} and throw out the words , but keep the time markings . And then go through {disfmarker} I mean , and go through and {disfmarker} and try and re - transcribe it , given that we had perfect boundary detection .
Turn 593, E (Postdoc): OK . Good idea .
Turn 594, C (PhD): And see if it {disfmarker} see if it {disfmarker} see if it feels easier to you .
Turn 595, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 596, D (Undergrad): And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr
Turn 597, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect .
Turn 598, C (PhD): Yeah , I mean uh , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along .
Turn 599, B (PhD): Well , no , you should do it {disfmarker} you should do it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do it again from scratch and then do it again at the boundaries . So you do the whole thing three times and then we get {disfmarker}
Turn 600, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 601, E (Postdoc): No . Now , there 's a plan .
Turn 602, D (Undergrad): And then {disfmarker} then w since we need some statistics do it three more .
Turn 603, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 604, D (Undergrad): And so you 'll get {disfmarker} you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done .
Turn 605, E (Postdoc): Oh , yeah . I 'll do that tomorrow . I should have it finished by the end of the day .
Turn 606, D (Undergrad): No , but the thing is the fact that she 's {disfmarker} she 's did it before just might give a lower bound . That 's all .
Turn 607, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 608, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 609, D (Undergrad): Uh , which is fine .
Turn 610, E (Postdoc): Exactly .
Turn 611, D (Undergrad): It 's {disfmarker} And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time .
Turn 612, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 613, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 614, E (Postdoc): Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate {disfmarker}
Turn 615, B (PhD): Oh !
Turn 616, E (Postdoc): uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time ,
Turn 617, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 618, E (Postdoc): so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in {disfmarker} in that case . And it 's not really strictly comparable . So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new {disfmarker} a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text .
Turn 619, B (PhD): The point we {disfmarker} where do we get the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the oracle boundaries from ?
Turn 620, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 621, B (PhD): Or the boundaries .
Turn 622, A (Grad): Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the {disfmarker} and the other person would have to {disfmarker}
Turn 623, E (Postdoc): Well , but couldn't I do it for the next {disfmarker}
Turn 624, B (PhD): We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we could get fake {disfmarker}
Turn 625, A (Grad): I mean that 's easy enough .
Turn 626, E (Postdoc): Oh , I see what you mean .
Turn 627, A (Grad): I could do that .
Turn 628, E (Postdoc): Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ?
Turn 629, A (Grad): No , no .
Turn 630, B (PhD): That would be the automatic boundaries .
Turn 631, C (PhD): No , no , no , no . You wanna know {disfmarker} given {disfmarker} Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well {disfmarker}
Turn 632, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 633, C (PhD): I mean , the {disfmarker} the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ?
Turn 634, E (Postdoc): Oh , I see what you mean .
Turn 635, A (Grad): I mean , that {disfmarker} that 's easy enough .
Turn 636, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 637, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 638, A (Grad): I could generate the segmentation and {disfmarker} and you could do the words , and time yourself on it . So .
Turn 639, D (Undergrad): A little double - blind - ear kind of thing .
Turn 640, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 641, E (Postdoc): I see . OK .
Turn 642, A (Grad): So it {disfmarker} that might be worth doing .
Turn 643, E (Postdoc): That 's good . I like that .
Turn 644, A (Grad): That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations .
Turn 645, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 646, D (Undergrad): And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that {vocalsound} sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future but if {disfmarker} if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there .
Turn 647, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 648, E (Postdoc): And the other thing too is with {disfmarker} with speaker identification , if {disfmarker} if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal .
Turn 649, B (PhD): Well it w
Turn 650, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 651, D (Undergrad): Well , use it . Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones .
Turn 652, E (Postdoc): OK . Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature .
Turn 653, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 654, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 655, E (Postdoc): That 's a major {disfmarker} that 's like , one of the two things that {disfmarker}
Turn 656, C (PhD): I mean , there 's gonna {disfmarker} there 's gonna be {disfmarker} in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be a bit of a problem
Turn 657, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 658, C (PhD): because , like , I wasn't wearing a microphone
Turn 659, B (PhD): Yes .
Turn 660, C (PhD): f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones .
Turn 661, A (Grad): That {disfmarker}
Turn 662, D (Undergrad): But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ?
Turn 663, A (Grad): That 'll s
Turn 664, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 665, C (PhD): That 's pretty much true
Turn 666, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 667, A (Grad): it might save ninety percent of the work though .
Turn 668, C (PhD): but {disfmarker} but , yes .
Turn 669, A (Grad): So .
Turn 670, B (PhD): So I {disfmarker} I need to {disfmarker} we need to look at what {disfmarker} what the final output is but it seems like {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker} it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate {vocalsound} the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words .
Turn 671, A (Grad): Yeah . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format ,
Turn 672, E (Postdoc): That 'd be so great .
Turn 673, A (Grad): so it would be easy .
Turn 674, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 675, E (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 676, A (Grad): If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ?
Turn 677, E (Postdoc): We didn't finish the {disfmarker} the part of work already completed on this , did we ? I mean , you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions ,
Turn 678, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 679, E (Postdoc): and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into {disfmarker} So , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} when I {disfmarker} i the {disfmarker} it 's quickest for me in terms of {vocalsound} the transcription part {vocalsound} to say {vocalsound} something like , you know , if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if Adam spoke to , um {disfmarker} to just say , " A colon " , Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line .
Turn 680, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 681, E (Postdoc): and E colon {vocalsound} instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the {disfmarker} the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID .
Turn 682, A (Grad): It 's pretty cute .
Turn 683, E (Postdoc): If that 's clear .
Turn 684, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 685, A (Grad): But at any rate . So , um ,
Turn 686, E (Postdoc): It 's Perl script .
Turn 687, A (Grad): Right . So {disfmarker} so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard . Everyone {disfmarker} more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription .
Turn 688, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 689, D (Undergrad): Using wh using stone age
Turn 690, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 691, D (Undergrad): using stone age tools .
Turn 692, E (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 693, A (Grad): Using {disfmarker} using stone age tools . I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber
Turn 694, E (Postdoc): Yeah , well that 's true , but {disfmarker}
Turn 695, A (Grad): which is a service that you send an audio file , they do a first - pass speech recognition . And then they {disfmarker} they do a clean up . But it 's gonna be horrible . They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this .
Turn 696, B (PhD): No .
Turn 697, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 698, E (Postdoc): What {disfmarker} i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or {disfmarker} or whatever ?
Turn 699, A (Grad): Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . They want you to call and {disfmarker} and talk . So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour .
Turn 700, E (Postdoc): Of {disfmarker} of tape ?
Turn 701, A (Grad): Thirty {disfmarker} So , yeah .
Turn 702, E (Postdoc): Or of action ?
Turn 703, A (Grad): For thirty dollars an hour for {disfmarker} of their work .
Turn 704, E (Postdoc): OK . OK . Oh , of their {disfmarker}
Turn 705, A (Grad): So {disfmarker} so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour .
Turn 706, E (Postdoc): Oh !
Turn 707, C (PhD): So that 's three {disfmarker} that 's three hours .
Turn 708, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 709, D (Undergrad): D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for {disfmarker} for uh , TV ?
Turn 710, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 711, A (Grad): No .
Turn 712, D (Undergrad): Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it .
Turn 713, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah , so {disfmarker} so my {disfmarker} my search was pretty cursory .
Turn 714, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 715, A (Grad): It was just a net search . And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that .
Turn 716, D (Undergrad): Well , you know , the {disfmarker} the thing {disfmarker} the thing about this is thinking kind of , maybe a little more globally than I should here but {comment} {vocalsound} that really this could be a big contribution we could make . Uh , I mean , we 've been through the STP thing , we know what it {disfmarker} what it 's like to {disfmarker} to manage the {disfmarker} manage the process , and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we 're looking for here but {vocalsound} it was a {disfmarker} it was a big hassle , right ?
Turn 717, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 718, D (Undergrad): I mean , uh , you know , they {disfmarker} they constantly could 've reminding people and going over it . And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here . And it 's {disfmarker} it 's only {vocalsound} our time , where " our " of course includes Dan , {vocalsound} Dan and you guys . It doesn't include me at all . Uh . j Just seems like {disfmarker}
Turn 719, B (PhD): Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems . But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than {disfmarker}
Turn 720, D (Undergrad): Bec Why ? Because they wanted a lot more detail ?
Turn 721, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 722, B (PhD): No . Because they had {disfmarker} because they only had two speakers , right ? I mean , the {disfmarker} the segmentation problem is {disfmarker}
Turn 723, A (Grad): Trivial .
Turn 724, D (Undergrad): Only had two .
Turn 725, A (Grad): They had two speakers over the telephone .
Turn 726, D (Undergrad): Oh , I see . So what took them so long ?
Turn 727, A (Grad): Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time .
Turn 728, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 729, A (Grad): So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription .
Turn 730, D (Undergrad): Right . Right .
Turn 731, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 732, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 733, A (Grad): And so we 're {disfmarker} w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that .
Turn 734, D (Undergrad): I see . But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that {disfmarker} which is clearly a hassle .
Turn 735, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 736, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 737, A (Grad): Right . And so {disfmarker} so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour .
Turn 738, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 739, A (Grad): I think that 's the ball park . There were several different companies that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the range was very tight for technical documents . Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour .
Turn 740, C (PhD): And who who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ?
Turn 741, B (PhD): Yeah , they won't .
Turn 742, A (Grad): They won't .
Turn 743, B (PhD): They w they 'll refuse to do it .
Turn 744, A (Grad): We 'll have to mix them .
Turn 745, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 746, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 747, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 748, B (PhD): No , but I mean , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they won't {disfmarker} they won't {disfmarker} they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material .
Turn 749, E (Postdoc): And then there 's the problem also that {disfmarker}
Turn 750, B (PhD): That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ?
Turn 751, A (Grad): Yes , it is .
Turn 752, D (Undergrad): Well , they might {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they might quote it {disfmarker}
Turn 753, B (PhD): For quoting meetings ?
Turn 754, A (Grad): Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , or speaker change mark .
Turn 755, B (PhD): Wow . Yeah .
Turn 756, A (Grad): They all just said transcription .
Turn 757, D (Undergrad): Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co {comment} Something like that .
Turn 758, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 759, A (Grad): Well , the {disfmarker} the way it worked is it {disfmarker} it was scaled . So what they had is , {vocalsound} if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time . And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time . So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do .
Turn 760, B (PhD): I see . Yeah .
Turn 761, A (Grad): It would probably be a little more
Turn 762, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 763, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 764, A (Grad): because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking .
Turn 765, D (Undergrad): A lot of companies I 've worked for y the , uh {disfmarker} the person leading the meeting , the executive or whatever , would sort of go around the room and {disfmarker} and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing ,
Turn 766, A (Grad): So .
Turn 767, D (Undergrad): right ? In university {vocalsound} atmosphere you get a little different thing . But you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour , he 's worth {disfmarker} " And so he so here we 're thinking , " well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . " You know ? It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 768, A (Grad): Yep , we have to have a short meeting .
Turn 769, D (Undergrad): So ch {vocalsound} So every everybody ta Talk really fast .
Turn 770, E (Postdoc): That 's very interesting .
Turn 771, A (Grad): Stop talking !
Turn 772, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 773, D (Undergrad): Let 's get it over with .
Turn 774, E (Postdoc): Talk {vocalsound} slowly but with few words .
Turn 775, A (Grad): And clearly .
Turn 776, B (PhD): That 's right .
Turn 777, D (Undergrad): And only talk when you 're pointed to .
Turn 778, E (Postdoc): There you go .
Turn 779, A (Grad): Content words only .
Turn 780, E (Postdoc): We could have some telegraphic meetings . That might be interesting .
Turn 781, B (PhD): Yeah , it 'd be cheap .
Turn 782, D (Undergrad): 
Turn 783, B (PhD): Cheap to transcribe .
Turn 784, A (Grad): So . But at any rate , so we {disfmarker} we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out .
Turn 785, D (Undergrad): And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ?
Turn 786, A (Grad): Thirty or forty .
Turn 787, D (Undergrad): So thirty or forty thousand dollars .
Turn 788, B (PhD): Well , for ten thousand dollars .
Turn 789, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 790, C (PhD): So , meanwhile {disfmarker}
Turn 791, D (Undergrad): Oh . What {disfmarker} Well , it was thirty times {disfmarker}
Turn 792, B (PhD): Three hundred .
Turn 793, A (Grad): Three hundred dollars an hour .
Turn 794, D (Undergrad): Oh , I 'm sorry , three hundred .
Turn 795, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 796, D (Undergrad): Right , I w got an extra factor of three there .
Turn 797, C (PhD): So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ?
Turn 798, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 799, C (PhD): But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour . And the question is what 's the difference {disfmarker}
Turn 800, B (PhD): How {disfmarker} how much lower are they ?
Turn 801, C (PhD): or ei eight dollars . What {disfmarker} do you know what the going rate is ? It 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} on the order of eight to ten .
Turn 802, E (Postdoc): I think uh that would give us a {disfmarker} a good {disfmarker} good estimate .
Turn 803, C (PhD): I think . But I 'm not sure .
Turn 804, E (Postdoc): I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd say {disfmarker}
Turn 805, B (PhD): Ten .
Turn 806, E (Postdoc): yeah , I was gonna say eight {disfmarker} you 'd say ten ?
Turn 807, C (PhD): Let 's say ten .
Turn 808, B (PhD): Yeah , give them a break .
Turn 809, C (PhD): Cuz it 's easier .
Turn 810, D (Undergrad): The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ?
Turn 811, A (Grad): Right , these are linguistics grad students . Six .
Turn 812, C (PhD): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't know what the {disfmarker} I don't know what the standard {disfmarker}
Turn 813, D (Undergrad): That 's right .
Turn 814, C (PhD): but there is a standard pay scale
Turn 815, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 816, C (PhD): I just don't know what it is .
Turn 817, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right . That 's right .
Turn 818, C (PhD): Um , so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to {disfmarker} to do graduate students .
Turn 819, E (Postdoc): And there 's another aspect too .
Turn 820, A (Grad): I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper .
Turn 821, B (PhD): No , it isn't . So .
Turn 822, E (Postdoc): The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be {disfmarker} you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh {disfmarker} tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time .
Turn 823, A (Grad): And also we would have control of {disfmarker} I mean , we could give them feedback . Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount .
Turn 824, B (PhD): Yep , yep .
Turn 825, E (Postdoc): Mmm .
Turn 826, A (Grad): I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress
Turn 827, E (Postdoc): Good point .
Turn 828, B (PhD): Yep .
Turn 829, A (Grad): and for this meeting we want {disfmarker} "
Turn 830, B (PhD): No .
Turn 831, E (Postdoc): Good point .
Turn 832, A (Grad): And {disfmarker} and they 're not gonna provide {disfmarker} they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna {vocalsound} provide {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they may or may not provide speaker ID . So that we would have to do our own tools to do that . So {disfmarker}
Turn 833, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 834, A (Grad): I just {disfmarker}
Turn 835, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 836, D (Undergrad): Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that {disfmarker} that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . I who {disfmarker} who 's the person in charge ? Who 's gonna be the Steve here ?
Turn 837, A (Grad): I hope it 's Jane .
Turn 838, D (Undergrad): You ?
Turn 839, A (Grad): Is that alright ?
Turn 840, E (Postdoc): Oh , interesting . Um , now would this involve some manner of uh , monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ?
Turn 841, A (Grad): Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it .
Turn 842, B (PhD): Yeah , out of {disfmarker} out of Adam 's pocket .
Turn 843, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 844, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 845, D (Undergrad): You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave . See ?
Turn 846, E (Postdoc): Oh ,
Turn 847, D (Undergrad): That 's why Dave should have been here .
Turn 848, E (Postdoc): I don't wanna stop working for Dave .
Turn 849, D (Undergrad): To pr protect his people .
Turn 850, A (Grad): Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do ,
Turn 851, E (Postdoc): Oh , cool . Yeah .
Turn 852, A (Grad): but if {disfmarker} if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor .
Turn 853, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 854, D (Undergrad): W we 'd like you to do it and we 'd like to pay you .
Turn 855, E (Postdoc): We 'll see .
Turn 856, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 857, D (Undergrad): Not being Morgan though , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 858, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 859, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 860, E (Postdoc): Oh , I see .
Turn 861, B (PhD): We 'd like to . Unfortunately {disfmarker}
Turn 862, E (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 863, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 864, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 865, A (Grad): Yeah , six dollars an hour .
Turn 866, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I see .
Turn 867, C (PhD): That 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 868, D (Undergrad): And {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker}
Turn 869, E (Postdoc): OK . Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again .
Turn 870, B (PhD): Yeah , that 's right . Yeah .
Turn 871, D (Undergrad): an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale .
Turn 872, E (Postdoc): I see . Good . Yeah , no , that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would be interested in that {disfmarker} in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that {disfmarker}
Turn 873, A (Grad): OK . More .
Turn 874, E (Postdoc): more . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah .
Turn 875, A (Grad): Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ?
Turn 876, B (PhD): What s so what are you {disfmarker} so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . And what 's your plan ?
Turn 877, E (Postdoc): Yes . Mm - hmm .
Turn 878, B (PhD): To carry on doing it ?
Turn 879, E (Postdoc): What {disfmarker} Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement .
Turn 880, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 881, E (Postdoc): The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} It 's a good suggestion . So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . And so my next plan would be {disfmarker}
Turn 882, B (PhD): What {disfmarker} what do they {disfmarker} what do they cover ?
Turn 883, E (Postdoc): They 're very minimal . So , {vocalsound} it would be good to {disfmarker} just to summarize that . So , um , {vocalsound} one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change ,
Turn 884, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 885, E (Postdoc): and this is a way which meshes well with {disfmarker} with , uh , making it {vocalsound} so that , uh , you know , on the {disfmarker} At the {disfmarker}
Turn 886, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 887, E (Postdoc): Boy , it 's such a nice interface . When you {disfmarker} when you get the , um {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you get the speech signal you also get {vocalsound} down beneath it , {vocalsound} an indication of , {vocalsound} uh , if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them {vocalsound} one {disfmarker} displayed one above each other . And then at the same time {vocalsound} the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . You can clip {disfmarker} click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you . And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two {disfmarker} these two things .
Turn 888, D (Undergrad): Is there a limit to the number of speakers ?
Turn 889, A (Grad): Um , the user interface only allows two . And so if {disfmarker} if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two .
Turn 890, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 891, A (Grad): But my script can handle any . And their save format can handle any . And so , um , using this {disfmarker} the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want .
Turn 892, D (Undergrad): Do y is this a , uh , university project ?
Turn 893, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 894, D (Undergrad): Th - this is the French software , right ?
Turn 895, A (Grad): Yeah , French .
Turn 896, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah ,
Turn 897, A (Grad): Yeah . And they 're {disfmarker} they 've been quite responsive .
Turn 898, B (PhD): their academic .
Turn 899, D (Undergrad): eh
Turn 900, A (Grad): I 've been exchanging emails on various issues .
Turn 901, B (PhD): Oh , really ?
Turn 902, D (Undergrad): Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ?
Turn 903, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 904, A (Grad): Yes , and they said that 's on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the works for the next version .
Turn 905, D (Undergrad): Good .
Turn 906, C (PhD): Oh , so multi multichannels .
Turn 907, D (Undergrad): Good .
Turn 908, A (Grad): Multichannels was also {disfmarker} Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen .
Turn 909, C (PhD): I see . OK .
Turn 910, D (Undergrad): Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? Why 'd they develop it ?
Turn 911, A (Grad): For this exact task ?
Turn 912, C (PhD): For transcription .
Turn 913, D (Undergrad): Are they linguists ?
Turn 914, C (PhD): It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 915, D (Undergrad): But I mean , are they {disfmarker} are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ?
Turn 916, A (Grad): I think they 're linguists .
Turn 917, E (Postdoc): Ho
Turn 918, B (PhD): Linguists .
Turn 919, E (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 920, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 921, C (PhD): They 're {disfmarker} they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , the Linguistic Data Consortium . Um ,
Turn 922, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 923, C (PhD): so {disfmarker} but a apart from that .
Turn 924, A (Grad): It 's also {disfmarker} All the source is available .
Turn 925, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 926, A (Grad): So .
Turn 927, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 928, A (Grad): If you {disfmarker} if you speak TCLTK .
Turn 929, D (Undergrad): Great . Mm - hmm .
Turn 930, A (Grad): And they have {disfmarker} they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said , well , maybe .
Turn 931, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 932, D (Undergrad): Good .
Turn 933, A (Grad): So if we want {disfmarker} if we did {disfmarker} if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in .
Turn 934, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah , I do too .
Turn 935, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 936, D (Undergrad): Their pre pre - lay .
Turn 937, B (PhD): Pre - lay .
Turn 938, A (Grad): Way .
Turn 939, E (Postdoc): Pre - lay . Well , and they 've thought about things . You know , I mean , they {disfmarker} they do have {disfmarker} So you have {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} when you play it back , um , it 's {disfmarker} it is useful to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a break mark to {disfmarker} se segment it . But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the {disfmarker} uh , the tabbed key to toggle {vocalsound} the sound on and off . I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab . And , um . And so , uh , that 's a nice feature . And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of {vocalsound} cycling through the unit . You could do it like multiply until you get {comment} crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit .
Turn 940, D (Undergrad): Loop it ? Yo - you n you know , there 's al also the {disfmarker} the user interface that 's missing .
Turn 941, E (Postdoc): Or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Turn 942, D (Undergrad): It 's missing from all of our offices , and that is some sort of analog input for something like this . It 's what audio people actually use of course . It 's something that wh {vocalsound} when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it , like fast forward . You know , like a joy stick or a {disfmarker} uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that .
Turn 943, E (Postdoc): Why , that 's {disfmarker} That 's not something I wanted to have happen .
Turn 944, D (Undergrad): No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} m for video or for audio {disfmarker} {vocalsound} where you {disfmarker} you need to do this ,
Turn 945, E (Postdoc): I see . Uh - huh .
Turn 946, D (Undergrad): and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that .
Turn 947, B (PhD): Mmm . Mmm .
Turn 948, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 949, A (Grad): Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog {disfmarker}
Turn 950, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 951, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 952, A (Grad): So {vocalsound} I mean , tho those are things we could do but I {disfmarker} I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . I mean we 're just gonna have {disfmarker}
Turn 953, D (Undergrad): Ye - Yeah .
Turn 954, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 955, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 956, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . They {disfmarker} they have several options . So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary . And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab
Turn 957, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 958, E (Postdoc): and it goes on to the next unit .
Turn 959, D (Undergrad): Cool .
Turn 960, E (Postdoc): I mean , it 's very nicely thought out .
Turn 961, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 962, E (Postdoc): They thought about {disfmarker} and also it 'll {vocalsound} go around the c the , uh , I wanna say cursor but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing .
Turn 963, A (Grad): Point , whatever .
Turn 964, E (Postdoc): Anyway , you can {disfmarker} so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c uh work within ,
Turn 965, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 966, E (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , {vocalsound} uh , basically , {vocalsound} uh , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w provisions for , uh , w uh , {vocalsound} colloquial forms . So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in {disfmarker} in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be .
Turn 967, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 968, E (Postdoc): And this could be {vocalsound} something that was handled by a table or something but I think {vocalsound} to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard {disfmarker} but a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a non {vocalsound} uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever .
Turn 969, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 970, A (Grad): Non - canonical .
Turn 971, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 972, E (Postdoc): " Gonna " or " wanna " , you know , the same thing . And {disfmarker} and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation .
Turn 973, C (PhD): How are you handling backchannels ?
Turn 974, E (Postdoc): Backchannels ?
Turn 975, A (Grad): Comments .
Turn 976, E (Postdoc): Um , you know {disfmarker} oh , yes , there was some {disfmarker} in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about {disfmarker} I didn't worry about s specific start times .
Turn 977, C (PhD): What do you mean by du
Turn 978, E (Postdoc): I sort of thought that this is not gonna be {comment} easily processed anyway and {vocalsound} maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said {vocalsound} " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " .
Turn 979, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 980, E (Postdoc): And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , {vocalsound} there were two people speaking during part of it
Turn 981, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 982, E (Postdoc): and {vocalsound} if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " ,
Turn 983, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 984, A (Grad): Well , I think what {disfmarker} w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech ,
Turn 985, C (PhD): I see .
Turn 986, E (Postdoc): was sort of the way I felt @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 987, A (Grad): right ?
Turn 988, C (PhD): Well , yeah , what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 989, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 990, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh . That happened very seldom .
Turn 991, C (PhD): Oh , cuz I was {disfmarker} I was listening to {disfmarker} Dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking .
Turn 992, D (Undergrad): Uh - huh . Uh - huh .
Turn 993, E (Postdoc): Oh , well , thank you Dan .
Turn 994, C (PhD): So .
Turn 995, E (Postdoc): Appreciate it . Well , if it {disfmarker} if there was a word like " right " , you know , then I wou I would indicate {vocalsound} that it happened within the same tem time frame
Turn 996, A (Grad): Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark .
Turn 997, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 998, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 999, E (Postdoc): but wouldn't say exactly when it happened .
Turn 1000, D (Undergrad): I 'll be right back .
Turn 1001, B (PhD): I transcribed a minute of this stuff
Turn 1002, C (PhD): I see .
Turn 1003, B (PhD): and there was a lot of overlapping . It was {disfmarker}
Turn 1004, E (Postdoc): A lot of overlapping , yeah .
Turn 1005, A (Grad): Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end .
Turn 1006, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1007, A (Grad): Huge amounts .
Turn 1008, B (PhD): It was at the beginning .
Turn 1009, A (Grad): Um , when {disfmarker} when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , {vocalsound} and we 're all sort of separated , and {disfmarker} and doing things . But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap but it {disfmarker} it 's marked pretty clearly . Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting . And so I think that {disfmarker} that often {disfmarker} {vocalsound} often you can't tell .
Turn 1010, E (Postdoc): Yeah , well that 's true . That 's another issue .
Turn 1011, A (Grad): I mean , Jane had {disfmarker} had comments like uh , to {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who the person was speaking to .
Turn 1012, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1013, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1014, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1015, E (Postdoc): Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling
Turn 1016, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1017, E (Postdoc): because he was in the other room talking .
Turn 1018, A (Grad): Yeah , but someone who , uh , {vocalsound} was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that .
Turn 1019, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1020, A (Grad): Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " .
Turn 1021, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 1022, E (Postdoc): That 's true . I know .
Turn 1023, D (Undergrad): So you take a bathroom break in the middle and {disfmarker} and keep your head mount
Turn 1024, A (Grad): You have to turn off your mike .
Turn 1025, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1026, D (Undergrad): Oh , you do ?
Turn 1027, B (PhD): You don't have to .
Turn 1028, E (Postdoc): Well he was so {disfmarker} so he was checking the meter levels and {disfmarker} and we were handling things while he was labeling the {disfmarker} the whatever it was , the PDA ?
Turn 1029, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1030, B (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 1031, E (Postdoc):  And {disfmarker} and so he was {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} sort of {disfmarker} you were sort of talking {disfmarker} you know , so I was saying , like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} " and I could label this one left . Right ? " And he {disfmarker} and he said , " I don't see anything " . And he said {disfmarker} {vocalsound} he said , {vocalsound} " I wasn't talking to you " . Or {disfmarker} it wasn't {disfmarker} it didn't sound quite that rude .
Turn 1032, A (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1033, E (Postdoc): But really , no , uh {disfmarker} w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying {disfmarker}
Turn 1034, A (Grad): but when you w when you listen to it {disfmarker}
Turn 1035, D (Undergrad): he he It was a lot funnier if you were there though .
Turn 1036, E (Postdoc): Uh , yeah ,
Turn 1037, A (Grad): Well what {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total {disfmarker} {vocalsound} totally impolite .
Turn 1038, E (Postdoc): I know . Well , you 'll see . You can listen to it . Oh , I thought it was you who was . No , well , but you were {disfmarker} you were asking off the wall questions .
Turn 1039, A (Grad): Um {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} but if you knew that {disfmarker} that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it {disfmarker} it became OK . So .
Turn 1040, B (PhD): I see .
Turn 1041, D (Undergrad): So th
Turn 1042, E (Postdoc): And that 's w that 's where I added comments .
Turn 1043, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 1044, E (Postdoc): The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but {disfmarker} but this was unusual circum circumstance .
Turn 1045, D (Undergrad): So this is {disfmarker} this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape , right ?
Turn 1046, A (Grad): Yes . Right .
Turn 1047, E (Postdoc): Well and part of it was funny , uh {disfmarker} reason was because it was a mixed signal so you couldn't get any clues from volume {vocalsound} that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation .
Turn 1048, A (Grad): Stereo . Yeah .
Turn 1049, E (Postdoc): You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case .
Turn 1050, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1051, A (Grad): Oh . I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . I have a {pause} auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal
Turn 1052, E (Postdoc): That 's a good idea .
Turn 1053, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1054, A (Grad): and that seems to work really well for the uh {pause} transcribers .
Turn 1055, D (Undergrad): Great .
Turn 1056, E (Postdoc): But I thought it would be {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . And , uh {disfmarker} OK ,
Turn 1057, C (PhD): So , s
Turn 1058, E (Postdoc): so normalization {disfmarker}
Turn 1059, C (PhD): I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels ,
Turn 1060, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1061, C (PhD): if that 's OK ,
Turn 1062, E (Postdoc): Yeah . OK .
Turn 1063, C (PhD): which {disfmarker} which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while
Turn 1064, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1065, C (PhD): and somebody goes " mm - hmm " in the middle of it , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and what not , does the conversation come out from the {disfmarker} or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment {vocalsound} of this other speaker or does it {disfmarker} does the fact that there 's a backchannel split the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it in two .
Turn 1066, E (Postdoc): OK , my {disfmarker} my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . Like {vocalsound} I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . So {vocalsound} if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a {disfmarker} of someone 's , {vocalsound} uh , uh , intonational contour , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I indicated it as , like what you just did .
Turn 1067, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1068, E (Postdoc): then I indicated it as a segment which contained {vocalsound} @ @ {comment} this utterance plus an overlap .
Turn 1069, B (PhD): But that 's {disfmarker} but there 's only one {disfmarker} there 's only one time boundary for both speakers ,
Turn 1070, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1071, B (PhD): right ?
Turn 1072, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right . And you know , it could be made more precise than that
Turn 1073, C (PhD): I see ,
Turn 1074, E (Postdoc): but I just thought {disfmarker}
Turn 1075, C (PhD): I see , OK .
Turn 1076, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1077, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 1078, D (Undergrad): I think whenever we use these speech words we should always {vocalsound} do the thing like you 're talking about , accent ,
Turn 1079, E (Postdoc): Oh , I see what you mean . And then {pause} " hesitation " . Yeah . OK , and so then , uh , in terms of like words like " uh " and " um " I just wrote them because I figured there 's a limited number , and I keep them to a {disfmarker} uh , limited set because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , {comment} {vocalsound} you know , versus " um " . So I just always wrote it as U M .
Turn 1080, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 1081, E (Postdoc): And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . But in any case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I didn't mark those .
Turn 1082, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1083, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1084, B (PhD): " Uh - huh " is " U H H U H . " H U H . "
Turn 1085, E (Postdoc): I 'd be happy with that . That 'd be fine . It 'd be good to have that in the {disfmarker} in the conventions , what 's to be used .
Turn 1086, C (PhD): Huh - uh .
Turn 1087, A (Grad): I {disfmarker} I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker . Then , so question mark colon is fine for that .
Turn 1088, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's a fine idea . That 's a fine idea .
Turn 1089, A (Grad): Just say silence .
Turn 1090, D (Undergrad): Well , what 's that mean ?
Turn 1091, E (Postdoc): Yeah , OK . Yeah .
Turn 1092, D (Undergrad): You mean re
Turn 1093, A (Grad): No one 's talking .
Turn 1094, D (Undergrad): ye s Oh . Silence all around .
Turn 1095, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1096, D (Undergrad): Yep .
Turn 1097, B (PhD): We have to mark those ?
Turn 1098, E (Postdoc): So I had {disfmarker}
Turn 1099, B (PhD): Don't they {disfmarker} d can't we just leave them unmarked ?
Turn 1100, E (Postdoc): I d Well , you see , that 's possible too .
Turn 1101, A (Grad): Well , I wanna leave the marked {disfmarker} I don't want them to be part of another utterance . So you just {disfmarker} you need to have the boundary at the start and the end .
Turn 1102, B (PhD): OK . Sure .
Turn 1103, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by part of the {disfmarker} part of the script or something more {disfmarker}
Turn 1104, B (PhD): Uh , yeah , it seems like {disfmarker} it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these {vocalsound} automatic speaker detection turn placing things . Because suddenly {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know , actually it sounds like there might be a problem {vocalsound} putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . But assuming we can get around that somehow .
Turn 1105, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Well you were saying , I think it can read {disfmarker}
Turn 1106, A (Grad): It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it
Turn 1107, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 1108, B (PhD): But what if you wanna edit it ? Right ? I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate {vocalsound} this transcript with five {disfmarker} five tracks in it , but with no words . Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . Um , and if there are five {disfmarker} five people speaking at once ,
Turn 1109, A (Grad): Right , i it 's {disfmarker} I didn't explain it well . If we use the {disfmarker} the little {disfmarker} the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention .
Turn 1110, B (PhD): Oh , yeah . Yes .
Turn 1111, E (Postdoc): Which allows five .
Turn 1112, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1113, E (Postdoc): And it can be m edited after the fact ,
Turn 1114, A (Grad): Yes .
Turn 1115, E (Postdoc): can't it also ? But their {disfmarker} but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , {vocalsound} then i they {disfmarker} a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers .
Turn 1116, B (PhD): Yeah . Right .
Turn 1117, D (Undergrad): But you 're saying that by the time you call it back in to {disfmarker} from their saved format it opens up a window with window with five speakers ?
Turn 1118, E (Postdoc): So . But .
Turn 1119, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1120, D (Undergrad): Oh ! That is sort of {pause} f
Turn 1121, A (Grad): It 's just user interface .
Turn 1122, D (Undergrad): They didn't quite go the whole {disfmarker}
Turn 1123, A (Grad): So i it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1124, D (Undergrad): Yeah , they didn't go the whole route ,
Turn 1125, A (Grad): the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers .
Turn 1126, D (Undergrad): did they ? They just {disfmarker}
Turn 1127, A (Grad): It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple {disfmarker} any more than two .
Turn 1128, D (Undergrad): Right . So your {disfmarker} your script solves {disfmarker} Doesn't it solve all our problems ,
Turn 1129, E (Postdoc): And that {disfmarker}
Turn 1130, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1131, D (Undergrad): cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing {disfmarker}
Turn 1132, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1133, D (Undergrad): uh , assuming it works .
Turn 1134, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1135, E (Postdoc): And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which {disfmarker} worry who the speaker was .
Turn 1136, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1137, D (Undergrad): I see . Right . Good .
Turn 1138, E (Postdoc): And then , uh , let 's see what else . Oh , yes , I {disfmarker} I wanted to have {disfmarker} So sometimes a pers I {disfmarker} uh in terms of like the continuity of thought {vocalsound} for transcriptions , it 's {disfmarker} i it isn't just words coming out , it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance . And {vocalsound} sometimes someone will {vocalsound} do a backchannel in the middle of it but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point . So I have {disfmarker} I have a convention of putting like a dash {vocalsound} arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . And then when it uh , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash , and then you have the opposite direction {vocalsound} to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , um , sometimes {vocalsound} we had the situation which is {disfmarker} you know , which you {disfmarker} which you get in conversations , {comment} of someone continuing someone else 's utterance ,
Turn 1139, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1140, E (Postdoc): and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , {vocalsound} to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't {disfmarker} Oh , I guess I did {vocalsound} equal arrow for the {disfmarker} for the own {disfmarker} for yourself things
Turn 1141, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1142, E (Postdoc): cuz it 's {disfmarker} the speakers the same . And then tilde arrow if it was a different {disfmarker} if a different speaker , uh , con continuation .
Turn 1143, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1144, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1145, E (Postdoc): But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought .
Turn 1146, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1147, E (Postdoc): And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing {disfmarker} you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later . And that was like this person continued
Turn 1148, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1149, E (Postdoc): and you 'd be able to {vocalsound} look for the continuation .
Turn 1150, A (Grad): So
Turn 1151, B (PhD): But the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers . Like , if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need {vocalsound} one arrow at each end , and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that {disfmarker} and they sort of swap . I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} then you need to know whether they were swapped or not .
Turn 1152, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 1153, C (PhD): How often does that happen do you think ?
Turn 1154, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1155, B (PhD): Hopefully not very much .
Turn 1156, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I didn't use it very often .
Turn 1157, A (Grad): Especially for meetings . I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know ,
Turn 1158, D (Undergrad): It l ou
Turn 1159, A (Grad): if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . But I think for meetings it 's probably alright .
Turn 1160, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 1161, A (Grad): But , a lot of these issues , I think that for {disfmarker} uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter .
Turn 1162, B (PhD): Sure .
Turn 1163, A (Grad): But other people have other interests .
Turn 1164, B (PhD): I know .
Turn 1165, A (Grad): So .
Turn 1166, B (PhD): But it {disfmarker} it does feel {disfmarker} it does feel like it 's really in there . I {disfmarker} you know I did this {disfmarker} I did this transcription and I marked that , I marked it with ellipsis because it seemed like there was a difference . It 's something you wanted to indicate that it {disfmarker} that I {disfmarker} this was the end of the phrase , this was the end of {vocalsound} that particular transcript , but it was continued later .
Turn 1167, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1168, B (PhD): And I picked up with an ellipsis .
Turn 1169, E (Postdoc): Excellent . Yeah .
Turn 1170, B (PhD): I didn't have the equal , not equal thing .
Turn 1171, E (Postdoc): Yeah . Well that 's {disfmarker} you know , I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't {comment} I didn't do it n {vocalsound} I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and {disfmarker} and re - ev
Turn 1172, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1173, E (Postdoc): and it didn't do {disfmarker} I didn't do it in ten times the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the time .
Turn 1174, A (Grad): Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ?
Turn 1175, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1176, A (Grad): Is that something you want to do , Dan ?
Turn 1177, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1178, A (Grad): No .
Turn 1179, B (PhD): But it 's something @ @ that I feel we definitely ought to do .
Turn 1180, E (Postdoc): I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed . Do you have a sense of how long {disfmarker}
Turn 1181, B (PhD): Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , but I didn't have any {disfmarker} I didn't even have a {disfmarker}
Turn 1182, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1183, B (PhD): I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit {disfmarker} It was horrible .
Turn 1184, E (Postdoc): OK . OK .
Turn 1185, D (Undergrad): So thirty to one 's what you got ?
Turn 1186, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1187, D (Undergrad): So that 's a new upper limit ?
Turn 1188, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1189, E (Postdoc): Well , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other {disfmarker}
Turn 1190, A (Grad): But I think for a first try that 's about right .
Turn 1191, B (PhD): Is it {disfmarker}
Turn 1192, C (PhD): So {disfmarker} so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1193, D (Undergrad): That 's right .
Turn 1194, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1195, B (PhD): It was actually {disfmarker} it was quite {disfmarker} it was a t
Turn 1196, D (Undergrad): a
Turn 1197, A (Grad): If we {pause} hire an infinite number of Dan 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1198, B (PhD): it w
Turn 1199, D (Undergrad): It 'd b a a
Turn 1200, E (Postdoc): And there 's always a warm up thing of {disfmarker}
Turn 1201, A (Grad): Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ?
Turn 1202, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1203, A (Grad): OK ,
Turn 1204, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1205, A (Grad): good .
Turn 1206, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1207, D (Undergrad): d Doesn't it beep in the other room when you 're out of disk space ?
Turn 1208, C (PhD): So {disfmarker} Is there {disfmarker}
Turn 1209, A (Grad): No .
Turn 1210, C (PhD): Maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things .
Turn 1211, B (PhD): Web site ! That 's great !
Turn 1212, C (PhD): I know .
Turn 1213, A (Grad): Dan 's sort of already started .
Turn 1214, B (PhD): We could have like business - to - business E - commerce as well !
Turn 1215, C (PhD): That 's right . No , but I 'm it would be interesting {disfmarker} it would be interesting to see {disfmarker}
Turn 1216, A (Grad): Can we sell banner ads ?
Turn 1217, D (Undergrad): Get {disfmarker} get paid for click - throughs ?
Turn 1218, A (Grad): What a good idea ,
Turn 1219, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1220, A (Grad): that 's how we could pay for the transcription .
Turn 1221, C (PhD): I want to introduce {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to introduce the word " snot - head " into the conversation at this point .
Turn 1222, B (PhD): We can have {disfmarker}
Turn 1223, D (Undergrad): You wanna word that won't be recognized ?
Turn 1224, C (PhD): You see , cuz {disfmarker} uh , cuz {disfmarker} Exactly . Um .
Turn 1225, E (Postdoc): Oh , I don't think so .
Turn 1226, C (PhD): No .
Turn 1227, A (Grad): Hey , what about me ?
Turn 1228, C (PhD): The r w What {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 1229, E (Postdoc): You 're the one who raised the issue .
Turn 1230, C (PhD): No . Alright , see here 's {disfmarker} here 's {disfmarker} here 's my thought behind it which is that , uh , the {disfmarker} the stuff that you 've been describing , Jane , I gu one has to , {vocalsound} of course {vocalsound} indicate , {comment} {vocalsound} um , i is very interesting ,
Turn 1231, E (Postdoc): Alright .
Turn 1232, C (PhD): and I I 'd like to be able to {disfmarker} to pore through , you know , the {disfmarker} the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that .
Turn 1233, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 1234, C (PhD): So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web .
Turn 1235, E (Postdoc): OK , now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech .
Turn 1236, B (PhD): Yes . Yes .
Turn 1237, E (Postdoc): Cuz {disfmarker} cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription {vocalsound} that I have on my account
Turn 1238, C (PhD): Either 's fine .
Turn 1239, B (PhD): We c
Turn 1240, E (Postdoc): but it doesn't matter .
Turn 1241, A (Grad): We can do it all .
Turn 1242, B (PhD): we can do it all ! We can write {disfmarker}
Turn 1243, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1244, B (PhD): Oh .
Turn 1245, E (Postdoc): Web site 's nice .
Turn 1246, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1247, E (Postdoc): Then you have to t you have to do an HT access .
Turn 1248, D (Undergrad): Web site 's what ?
Turn 1249, B (PhD): We could actually {disfmarker} maybe we could use the TCL plug - in . Oh , man .
Turn 1250, E (Postdoc): Ooo ! He 's committed himself to something .
Turn 1251, C (PhD): Ow . See he said the word TCL and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1252, D (Undergrad): But he does such a good job of it . He should be allowed to {disfmarker} to , you know , w do it .
Turn 1253, E (Postdoc): I know , I know .
Turn 1254, B (PhD): I know , but that {disfmarker} but , I {disfmarker} Right . But I should be allowed to but {disfmarker}
Turn 1255, D (Undergrad): If you just did a crappy job , {vocalsound} no nobody would want you to do it .
Turn 1256, B (PhD): I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own {disfmarker} {vocalsound} by my {disfmarker} according to my own priorities . Alright . Let 's look at it anyway . So definitely we should {disfmarker} we should have some kind of access to the data .
Turn 1257, A (Grad): And we have {disfmarker} we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around .
Turn 1258, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1259, A (Grad): I have several and Dan has a few ,
Turn 1260, B (PhD): Yes .
Turn 1261, A (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 1262, C (PhD): Right , so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things .
Turn 1263, E (Postdoc): Ah !
Turn 1264, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1265, E (Postdoc): Nice .
Turn 1266, B (PhD): Well , yeah .
Turn 1267, C (PhD): The {disfmarker}
Turn 1268, B (PhD): Well so then th
Turn 1269, A (Grad): Try {disfmarker} try to s consolidate . I mean , who wants to do that though ?
Turn 1270, B (PhD): the other side is , yeah .
Turn 1271, C (PhD): Uh , right .
Turn 1272, A (Grad): No one wants to do that . So .
Turn 1273, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1274, B (PhD): Right , that 's the problem .
Turn 1275, C (PhD): Well , we could put {disfmarker} we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt {disfmarker}
Turn 1276, D (Undergrad): Why ? What {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's the issue ?
Turn 1277, B (PhD): No one owns the project .
Turn 1278, D (Undergrad): No one what ?
Turn 1279, B (PhD): No one owns the project .
Turn 1280, A (Grad): Yeah , I own the project but I don't wanna do it .
Turn 1281, B (PhD): No one wants to own the project .
Turn 1282, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 1283, D (Undergrad): W well {pause} Do {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Turn 1284, A (Grad): It 's mine ! All mine !
Turn 1285, B (PhD): Well then you have to do the web site .
Turn 1286, D (Undergrad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1287, A (Grad): " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . "
Turn 1288, B (PhD): You know , it 's like , it 's that simple .
Turn 1289, D (Undergrad): b but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but what are you {disfmarker} what are you talking about for web site hacking ?
Turn 1290, B (PhD): No {disfmarker}
Turn 1291, D (Undergrad): You 're talking about writing HTML , right ?
Turn 1292, A (Grad): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that {disfmarker} that is legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
Turn 1293, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1294, D (Undergrad): But , is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier ?
Turn 1295, A (Grad): Absolutely . It 's {disfmarker} it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool . I haven't found any tools that I like .
Turn 1296, D (Undergrad): You y
Turn 1297, A (Grad): It 's just as easy to use {disfmarker} to edit the raw HTML as anything else .
Turn 1298, D (Undergrad): No kidding ?
Turn 1299, B (PhD): That 's obviously not true ,
Turn 1300, A (Grad): It 's obviously not true .
Turn 1301, B (PhD): but you have {disfmarker}
Turn 1302, D (Undergrad): No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes .
Turn 1303, B (PhD): Right . That 's true .
Turn 1304, D (Undergrad): The question is what is {disfmarker} what 's he looked at .
Turn 1305, E (Postdoc): Which one do you use Jim ?
Turn 1306, D (Undergrad): I use something called Trellix .
Turn 1307, E (Postdoc): Oh , that 's right . I remember . Yeah .
Turn 1308, D (Undergrad): And it {disfmarker}
Turn 1309, E (Postdoc): Which produces also site maps .
Turn 1310, A (Grad): Now , I guess if I were {disfmarker} if I were doing more powerful {disfmarker} excuse me {disfmarker} more complex web sites I might want to .
Turn 1311, D (Undergrad): it 's - it it 's very powerful .
Turn 1312, A (Grad): But most of the web sites I do aren't that complex .
Turn 1313, E (Postdoc): Well , would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use ?
Turn 1314, A (Grad): But . I think both .
Turn 1315, C (PhD): No , I think in
Turn 1316, A (Grad): Mostly in house .
Turn 1317, B (PhD): That 's right .
Turn 1318, C (PhD): I think mostly internal .
Turn 1319, D (Undergrad): Well , yeah ,
Turn 1320, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1321, D (Undergrad): but what does internal mean ?
Turn 1322, B (PhD): No , both .
Turn 1323, D (Undergrad): I mean , you 're leaving . People at UW wanna look at it . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's internal {comment} until {disfmarker}
Turn 1324, C (PhD): Right . Internal to the project .
Turn 1325, D (Undergrad): I see .
Turn 1326, E (Postdoc): We could do an HT access which would accommodate those things .
Turn 1327, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 1328, A (Grad): OK , well , send me links and I wi send me pointers , rather , and I 'll put it together .
Turn 1329, B (PhD): I 'm not {disfmarker} o
Turn 1330, E (Postdoc): Wonderful .
Turn 1331, B (PhD): OK . I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} how {vocalsound} important that distinction is . I don't think {vocalsound} we should say , {vocalsound} " oh , it 's internal therefore we don't have to make it very good " . I mean , you can say {vocalsound} " oh {disfmarker} oh , it 's internal
Turn 1332, C (PhD): No . No .
Turn 1333, B (PhD): therefore we can put data in it that we don't {disfmarker} we don't have to worry about releasing " . But I think the point is to try and {vocalsound} be coherent and make it a nice presentation .
Turn 1334, D (Undergrad): Right . I agree .
Turn 1335, E (Postdoc): Yeah , it is true , that is {disfmarker} it benefits to {disfmarker}
Turn 1336, D (Undergrad): Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later .
Turn 1337, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1338, E (Postdoc): That 's right . I mean , it 's the early on .
Turn 1339, D (Undergrad): Even if it 's just writing things up .
Turn 1340, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1341, D (Undergrad): You know ?
Turn 1342, E (Postdoc): It 's a great idea .
Turn 1343, A (Grad): OK , um , let 's move on to electronics .
Turn 1344, B (PhD): Ah . Great .
Turn 1345, D (Undergrad): d we {disfmarker} we out of tape {disfmarker} out of disk ?
Turn 1346, B (PhD): No , we 're doing {disfmarker} we 're doing great .
Turn 1347, D (Undergrad): I {disfmarker} I was looking for the actual box I plan to use , uh , but I {disfmarker} c all I could {disfmarker} I couldn't find it at the local store . But this is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the technology . It 's actually a little bit thinner than this . And it 's two by two , by one , and it would fit right under the {disfmarker} right under th the the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the lip ,
Turn 1348, A (Grad): Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great .
Turn 1349, D (Undergrad): yeah . There 's a lip in these tables .
Turn 1350, E (Postdoc): Nice .
Turn 1351, D (Undergrad): And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded .
Turn 1352, A (Grad): Clink ! Clink !
Turn 1353, D (Undergrad): Let 's see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} see what it does to the {disfmarker} But this was the uh {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just to review , and I also brought this {comment} along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around .
Turn 1354, A (Grad): And {disfmarker} and crinkle them and {disfmarker}
Turn 1355, B (PhD): What ?
Turn 1356, E (Postdoc): And th " that " being a diagram .
Turn 1357, B (PhD): What ?
Turn 1358, D (Undergrad): That {disfmarker} that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . These six tables here , {vocalsound} with {disfmarker} with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here .
Turn 1359, B (PhD): I see .
Turn 1360, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1361, D (Undergrad): Which es would {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . I 'll - I 'll show you the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the cro this is the table cross section . I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at .
Turn 1362, B (PhD): You trying to {pause} screw up the m the microphones ?
Turn 1363, A (Grad): Yes . He is . Absolutely .
Turn 1364, B (PhD): I mean th
Turn 1365, D (Undergrad): Well why not ? I mean , cuz this is what 's gonna happen . You got plenty of data . I won't come to your next meeting . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you So this is the box 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1366, A (Grad): Get your paper off my PDA !
Turn 1367, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1368, E (Postdoc): Yeah , let {disfmarker} let the record show that this is exhibit two B .
Turn 1369, D (Undergrad): That 's right . " Or not to be " . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1370, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1371, D (Undergrad): Uh , the box , uh {disfmarker} there 's a half inch lip here . The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch . And so the {disfmarker} the two {vocalsound} head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . The {disfmarker} the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this .
Turn 1372, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 1373, D (Undergrad): So there 'd be a subset of them used for {disfmarker} obviously j just use the ones at this end for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for this many . So {disfmarker} Excuse me . you 'd like a {disfmarker} a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on .
Turn 1374, B (PhD): Right . All the lights .
Turn 1375, D (Undergrad): So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's {disfmarker} that 's a tip off . And then the , uh {disfmarker} would wire the {disfmarker} all of the cables in a {disfmarker} in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time .
Turn 1376, E (Postdoc): That 's good .
Turn 1377, D (Undergrad): Uh , so this {disfmarker} this notion of putting down the P Z Ms {vocalsound} and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table
Turn 1378, A (Grad): Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely .
Turn 1379, D (Undergrad): or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 1380, A (Grad): So .
Turn 1381, D (Undergrad): Right . And so the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we just epoxy them down or something . Big screw into the table .
Turn 1382, B (PhD): Velcro .
Turn 1383, D (Undergrad): Uh , and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a p piece of {disfmarker}
Turn 1384, A (Grad): Sleeve .
Turn 1385, D (Undergrad): yeah , that {disfmarker} that stuff that people put with the little {disfmarker} you slip the wires into that 's {vocalsound} sort of shaped like that cross section .
Turn 1386, A (Grad): Oh . OK , not just sleeve them all ?
Turn 1387, D (Undergrad): Yeah . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down .
Turn 1388, A (Grad): And leave them loose ?
Turn 1389, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1390, E (Postdoc): That looks like a semi - circle .
Turn 1391, B (PhD): Yeah . It 's like a {disfmarker} it 's a sleeping policeman .
Turn 1392, A (Grad): Whoo !
Turn 1393, B (PhD): Speed bump !
Turn 1394, E (Postdoc): Sleeping pol
Turn 1395, B (PhD): Speed bump .
Turn 1396, A (Grad): Speed A " sleeping policeman " !
Turn 1397, D (Undergrad): Yeah , it 's like a speed bum {vocalsound} An
Turn 1398, E (Postdoc): Speed bump . That 's good . There we go s
Turn 1399, A (Grad): Cool .
Turn 1400, D (Undergrad): And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic .
Turn 1401, C (PhD): What is {disfmarker}
Turn 1402, D (Undergrad): They sorta look like this .
Turn 1403, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 1404, C (PhD): What does that mean ?
Turn 1405, B (PhD): That 's the s that 's British for speed bump ,
Turn 1406, C (PhD): Is it a speed bump ?
Turn 1407, D (Undergrad): So that the wires go through here .
Turn 1408, B (PhD): yeah .
Turn 1409, C (PhD): Wow .
Turn 1410, E (Postdoc): Oh , is that right ?
Turn 1411, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1412, E (Postdoc): I never heard that .
Turn 1413, A (Grad): That 's really cruel .
Turn 1414, D (Undergrad): So .
Turn 1415, E (Postdoc): Ah !
Turn 1416, A (Grad): OK , so that {disfmarker}
Turn 1417, D (Undergrad): s So it would c basically go on the diagonal here .
Turn 1418, C (PhD): It could go either way .
Turn 1419, A (Grad): So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ?
Turn 1420, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1421, C (PhD): I guess .
Turn 1422, D (Undergrad): Uh , because the {disfmarker}
Turn 1423, B (PhD): How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ?
Turn 1424, D (Undergrad): Because they 're there .
Turn 1425, A (Grad): Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ?
Turn 1426, B (PhD): Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box .
Turn 1427, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 1428, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 1429, D (Undergrad): And to {disfmarker} See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . Th
Turn 1430, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 1431, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1432, D (Undergrad): Uh . Dot , dot , dot .
Turn 1433, E (Postdoc): Which means two at each station .
Turn 1434, D (Undergrad): Well that {disfmarker} that 's the way people sit . That 's how many chairs are in the room .
Turn 1435, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1436, A (Grad): Alright .
Turn 1437, E (Postdoc): Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording .
Turn 1438, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 1439, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1440, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 1441, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 1442, D (Undergrad): And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in .
Turn 1443, A (Grad): But then none of these .
Turn 1444, D (Undergrad): Uh if {disfmarker} if you ha if you had nothing else .
Turn 1445, A (Grad): Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then .
Turn 1446, D (Undergrad): Yeah . Right . Right . I agree .
Turn 1447, B (PhD): Only if you had {disfmarker} Well it depends on this box , right ?
Turn 1448, D (Undergrad): Oh , true enough . And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box .
Turn 1449, B (PhD): Exactly .
Turn 1450, A (Grad): Oh , I didn't understand {disfmarker}
Turn 1451, D (Undergrad): This {disfmarker} this box {disfmarker} Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal .
Turn 1452, E (Postdoc): That being the wiring box .
Turn 1453, A (Grad): Oh , I see , I see .
Turn 1454, D (Undergrad): Uh . And , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , plus supply power to the microphones cuz the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage .
Turn 1455, A (Grad): So {disfmarker} so you 'd imagine some sort of {disfmarker} in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ?
Turn 1456, B (PhD): Hmm !
Turn 1457, D (Undergrad): Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to {disfmarker} quite literally that these things plug in . And there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a plug on the end of each of these {disfmarker} these , uh , ei eight cables .
Turn 1458, E (Postdoc): What {disfmarker}
Turn 1459, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1460, E (Postdoc): OK . Each of the blue wires ?
Turn 1461, B (PhD): But there are only four .
Turn 1462, D (Undergrad): An - and there 's only {disfmarker} there 's only four slots that are {disfmarker} you know , in {disfmarker} in the first version or the version we 're planning to {disfmarker} to build .
Turn 1463, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1464, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1465, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1466, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1467, D (Undergrad): So {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} that was the whole issue with the LED , that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you 're live .
Turn 1468, A (Grad): Oh , then it comes on . I see , I see . OK , good .
Turn 1469, D (Undergrad): Now the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the subtle issue here is that {disfmarker} tha I {disfmarker} I haven't really figured out a solution for this . So , we it 'll have to be convention . What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ?
Turn 1470, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1471, D (Undergrad): Well the {disfmarker} there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . So {disfmarker} th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things .
Turn 1472, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1473, B (PhD): Yeah , I mean , we {disfmarker} I had that last time .
Turn 1474, D (Undergrad): But .
Turn 1475, B (PhD): But uh there are actually {disfmarker} that you know , there 's an extra {disfmarker} there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ?
Turn 1476, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1477, B (PhD): So there are actually six {vocalsound} XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in , I had the wrong five , so I ended up {vocalsound} not recording one of the channels and recording the mix .
Turn 1478, D (Undergrad): How interesting . D did you do any recognition on the mix {disfmarker} mix out ?
Turn 1479, E (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 1480, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1481, D (Undergrad): Wonder whether it works any {disfmarker}
Turn 1482, B (PhD): But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ .
Turn 1483, D (Undergrad): Got the fifth ?
Turn 1484, A (Grad): You g
Turn 1485, D (Undergrad): Cool .
Turn 1486, E (Postdoc): Oh , how great .
Turn 1487, A (Grad): And did it work ?
Turn 1488, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1489, A (Grad): Did it sound good ?
Turn 1490, B (PhD): It 's not bad .
Turn 1491, D (Undergrad): Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Turn 1492, B (PhD): It 's not bad ,
Turn 1493, A (Grad): Wow .
Turn 1494, B (PhD): yeah .
Turn 1495, D (Undergrad): Ain't science wonderful ?
Turn 1496, E (Postdoc): That 's amazing .
Turn 1497, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1498, A (Grad): So what 's the schedule on these things ?
Turn 1499, D (Undergrad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 1500, B (PhD): But , you always {disfmarker}
Turn 1501, E (Postdoc): Wow .
Turn 1502, D (Undergrad): Uh , well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , uh , {vocalsound} powering system . And I {disfmarker} I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it .
Turn 1503, B (PhD): Hmm !
Turn 1504, D (Undergrad): So I 'm ready to build it . Which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done .
Turn 1505, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up
Turn 1506, B (PhD): See
Turn 1507, A (Grad): so that it 's a little more presentable and organized .
Turn 1508, D (Undergrad): I agree .
Turn 1509, A (Grad): And I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just not sure what that is . I mean , some sort of cabinet .
Turn 1510, D (Undergrad): Well I can build a cabinet . The {disfmarker} the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet .
Turn 1511, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1512, D (Undergrad): In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is . That cabinet can {disfmarker} can go away . We can use that for {disfmarker} for uh kindling or something . But if you can imagine what the right form factor is . Dan - Dan and I have sort of gone around on this , and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top {vocalsound} to allow access to the mixer for example .
Turn 1513, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1514, D (Undergrad): But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain , so you end up with this thing that {disfmarker} if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be {disfmarker} it 'd be fine . You wouldn't necessarily {disfmarker} Well , you s understand what I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 1515, A (Grad): Yeah , I understand .
Turn 1516, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1517, D (Undergrad): the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can start {disfmarker} start s sketching it out ,
Turn 1518, A (Grad): So .
Turn 1519, D (Undergrad): and I can certainly build it out of oak no problem , would it {disfmarker} you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of {disfmarker}
Turn 1520, A (Grad): I need a desk at home too , alright ? Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ?
Turn 1521, D (Undergrad): Well , the {disfmarker} as we found out with the {disfmarker} the thing that , uh , Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system {vocalsound} the stuff you buy is total crap . And I mean this is something you buy .
Turn 1522, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1523, D (Undergrad): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 1524, A (Grad): And it 's total crap .
Turn 1525, D (Undergrad): It 's total crap . Well , it 's useless for this function . Works fine for holding a Kleenex ,
Turn 1526, A (Grad): Right , Kleenex and telephones .
Turn 1527, D (Undergrad): but it {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 1528, A (Grad): Um , so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ?
Turn 1529, D (Undergrad): Oh , I {disfmarker} I 'm paid for .
Turn 1530, A (Grad): OK , great .
Turn 1531, D (Undergrad): I have no problem . No , but w certainly one of the issues is {disfmarker} is the , uh {disfmarker} is security .
Turn 1532, A (Grad): Hmm ? Mm - hmm .
Turn 1533, D (Undergrad): I mean , we 've been {disfmarker} been {disfmarker} been lax and lucky .
Turn 1534, A (Grad): Lax .
Turn 1535, B (PhD): Yeah . Yep .
Turn 1536, D (Undergrad): Really lucky with these things . But they 're not ours , so {disfmarker}
Turn 1537, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1538, D (Undergrad): the , uh {disfmarker} the flat panels .
Turn 1539, B (PhD): Oh , yeah !
Turn 1540, A (Grad): I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer .
Turn 1541, B (PhD): Well w yeah , exactly .
Turn 1542, D (Undergrad): Uh , let the record show at {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} at f four thirty - five {vocalsound} Adam Janin says {disfmarker}
Turn 1543, E (Postdoc): Wow . Tempting .
Turn 1544, B (PhD): We 'll know {disfmarker} we 'll know to come after .
Turn 1545, E (Postdoc): Tempting . Yeah .
Turn 1546, A (Grad): So , um , j uh , then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ?
Turn 1547, B (PhD): Sorry ?
Turn 1548, D (Undergrad): Slipped {disfmarker} almost slipped it by Dan .
Turn 1549, E (Postdoc): Use - user interface {disfmarker}
Turn 1550, A (Grad): A user interface . I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ? Or just something .
Turn 1551, B (PhD): Oh ! Sure .
Turn 1552, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1553, B (PhD): Well of course we do .
Turn 1554, A (Grad): And how do we want to do that ?
Turn 1555, E (Postdoc): You mean like see {disfmarker} see meter readings , from {disfmarker} while sitting here .
Turn 1556, A (Grad): J just so we see something .
Turn 1557, E (Postdoc): Wow .
Turn 1558, D (Undergrad): How about use the thing that um ACIRI 's doing .
Turn 1559, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1560, D (Undergrad): Which is to say just laptop with a wireless .
Turn 1561, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah . Sure .
Turn 1562, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1563, B (PhD): Which we 'll borrow from them , {vocalsound} when we need it .
Turn 1564, D (Undergrad): What 's wrong with yours ? If we bought you a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker}
Turn 1565, B (PhD): Oh , a Applecard . Sure . Right . Yeah , you could use my machine .
Turn 1566, C (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1567, D (Undergrad): What ?
Turn 1568, A (Grad): I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it .
Turn 1569, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} or the {disfmarker}
Turn 1570, D (Undergrad): N no , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm serious . Does {disfmarker} does the wireless thing work on your {disfmarker}
Turn 1571, A (Grad): Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ?
Turn 1572, B (PhD): Uh , that 's an ethernet connection .
Turn 1573, A (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1574, B (PhD): It 's going next door .
Turn 1575, D (Undergrad): Yeah {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no I 'm a I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I ain't joking here .
Turn 1576, A (Grad): We jus
Turn 1577, D (Undergrad): I 'm serious , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Turn 1578, B (PhD): Yeah . No , no , absolutely , that 's the right way to do it . T to have it uh , just {disfmarker}
Turn 1579, D (Undergrad): It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and {disfmarker} and look in the thing every so often ,
Turn 1580, B (PhD): Yeah . And given {disfmarker} given that we 've got a wireless {disfmarker} that we 've got a {disfmarker} we got the field .
Turn 1581, D (Undergrad): but just have the {disfmarker} It 's right there .
Turn 1582, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 1583, D (Undergrad): Right ? The antenna 's right there ,
Turn 1584, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1585, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1586, D (Undergrad): right outside the {disfmarker}
Turn 1587, B (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 1588, D (Undergrad): Y I mean , we need {disfmarker} obviously need to clear this with ACIRI but , uh , how tough can that be ? There {disfmarker} it you 'd {disfmarker} all you need 's web access , isn't it ?
Turn 1589, B (PhD): W we don't need X access
Turn 1590, D (Undergrad): In {disfmarker} in theory .
Turn 1591, B (PhD): but I mean that 's fine . That 's {disfmarker} that 's what it does ,
Turn 1592, D (Undergrad): OK ,
Turn 1593, B (PhD): yeah .
Turn 1594, D (Undergrad): great , great .
Turn 1595, A (Grad): Um ,
Turn 1596, B (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 1597, A (Grad): right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem .
Turn 1598, B (PhD): With a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} w
Turn 1599, D (Undergrad): No , and he {disfmarker} he had , reque @ @ {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my proposal is you have a laptop .
Turn 1600, B (PhD): No . Yeah . I do !
Turn 1601, D (Undergrad): You don't ?
Turn 1602, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1603, D (Undergrad): If {disfmarker} if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with i the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Turn 1604, B (PhD): No , I would love to but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave LAN thing they 're using .
Turn 1605, D (Undergrad): Really ?
Turn 1606, A (Grad): To {pause} Mac .
Turn 1607, B (PhD): Well Apple has their own thing , right ?
Turn 1608, C (PhD): He 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1609, D (Undergrad): Your new one ?
Turn 1610, A (Grad): Airport .
Turn 1611, D (Undergrad): I 'm sorry ?
Turn 1612, B (PhD): Apple has their own thing . And {disfmarker}
Turn 1613, D (Undergrad): I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port .
Turn 1614, B (PhD): Yeah , I think what {disfmarker} I think you {disfmarker} I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , so you could probably make it run with that , but .
Turn 1615, A (Grad): The question is , is there an Apple driver ?
Turn 1616, D (Undergrad): I {disfmarker} e
Turn 1617, B (PhD): Yeah , I 'm sure . I imagine there is . But {disfmarker} uh anyway there are {disfmarker} there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards
Turn 1618, D (Undergrad): But the two t
Turn 1619, B (PhD): and so I think if w if it doesn't {disfmarker} we should be able to find a machine that does that . I {disfmarker} I mean I know that doesn't {disfmarker} don't {disfmarker} don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that {disfmarker}
Turn 1620, D (Undergrad): Well , uh , b that {disfmarker} to me that 's a whole nother . That 's a whole nother issue .
Turn 1621, E (Postdoc): Hmm . Hmm .
Turn 1622, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1623, D (Undergrad): The {disfmarker} the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward .
Turn 1624, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1625, D (Undergrad): The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is a non - starter .
Turn 1626, B (PhD): Yeah . I see .
Turn 1627, D (Undergrad): That {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think that 's gonna work . So , I mean , either {disfmarker} either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already {disfmarker} in the group already owns , {vocalsound} a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not {disfmarker} not a disadvan {comment} {vocalsound} or else we {disfmarker} we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose .
Turn 1628, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Absolutely . Yeah .
Turn 1629, D (Undergrad): Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time .
Turn 1630, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1631, D (Undergrad): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people ,
Turn 1632, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 1633, D (Undergrad): right ? Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way
Turn 1634, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1635, D (Undergrad): and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev
Turn 1636, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Right . I 've {disfmarker} I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy ,
Turn 1637, C (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1638, A (Grad): and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back .
Turn 1639, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1640, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 1641, B (PhD): You 're kidding !
Turn 1642, D (Undergrad): Well , the next conference they will .
Turn 1643, A (Grad): So . Sure .
Turn 1644, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 1645, A (Grad): But that does mean {disfmarker} so we can use that as well .
Turn 1646, D (Undergrad): Well , uh , the {disfmarker} certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether you you can get compatible stuff .
Turn 1647, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1648, D (Undergrad): Uh , ask them what it costs . Ask them if they have an extra one . Who knows , they might have an extra {vocalsound} hardware s
Turn 1649, B (PhD): I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . Yeah .
Turn 1650, C (PhD): What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ?
Turn 1651, D (Undergrad): Good . Uh , the , uh {disfmarker} Tsk . It 's gonna be hooked up to all sorts of junk . There 's gonna be actually a {disfmarker} a plug at the front that 'll connect to people 's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in . And it 's gonna be con connected to the machine at the back . So we certainly could use that as {disfmarker} as a constant reminder of what the VU meters are doing .
Turn 1652, B (PhD): Huge VU meters .
Turn 1653, D (Undergrad): So people sitting here {comment} are going {vocalsound} " testing , one , two , three " !
Turn 1654, C (PhD): But I mean , that 's another {disfmarker} that 's another possibility that , you know , solves {disfmarker}
Turn 1655, D (Undergrad): It {disfmarker} a
Turn 1656, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1657, D (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 1658, B (PhD): That 's an end
Turn 1659, D (Undergrad): But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's {disfmarker} that 's there in front of you is really cool .
Turn 1660, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1661, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1662, B (PhD): I think and uh , having {disfmarker} having it on wireless is {disfmarker} is the neatest way {disfmarker} neatest way to do it .
Turn 1663, D (Undergrad): R
Turn 1664, A (Grad): I had {disfmarker}
Turn 1665, D (Undergrad): As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , " can you talk a bit louder ? "
Turn 1666, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1667, A (Grad): I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff
Turn 1668, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1669, A (Grad): and they said , " sure , whenever you want " . So I think it won't be a problem .
Turn 1670, B (PhD): Oh , cool . OK .
Turn 1671, D (Undergrad): And {disfmarker} and it 's a {disfmarker} a PCMCIA card , right ?
Turn 1672, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1673, D (Undergrad): PC card ,
Turn 1674, A (Grad): PC card .
Turn 1675, D (Undergrad): so you can have a slot ,
Turn 1676, B (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1677, D (Undergrad): right ? In your new machine ?
Turn 1678, C (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} it really come down to the driver .
Turn 1679, D (Undergrad): Is it with s
Turn 1680, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1681, C (PhD): I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 1682, A (Grad): Right , I mean , and if {disfmarker} and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC .
Turn 1683, D (Undergrad): Right , i it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll work {disfmarker} It 'll work the first time . I {disfmarker} I trust Steve Jobs .
Turn 1684, A (Grad): Good .
Turn 1685, B (PhD): Um ,
Turn 1686, A (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 1687, B (PhD): well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other .
Turn 1688, A (Grad): So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ?
Turn 1689, D (Undergrad): Uh , y yeah .
Turn 1690, A (Grad): Great .
Turn 1691, D (Undergrad): We {disfmarker} we need to {vocalsound} figure out what we want . Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1692, B (PhD): We 'd {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1693, D (Undergrad): Hey , what are those green lights doing ?
Turn 1694, A (Grad): They 're flashing !
Turn 1695, B (PhD): Uh - oh ! Uh - oh ! Does that {disfmarker} it means {disfmarker} it means it 's gonna explode . No .
Turn 1696, D (Undergrad): Cut the red wire , the red wire !
Turn 1697, B (PhD): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 1698, A (Grad): When people talk , it {disfmarker} they go on and off .
Turn 1699, B (PhD): This {disfmarker} So again , Washington wants to equip a system . Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC . However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes . Uh ,
Turn 1700, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1701, B (PhD): using {disfmarker} using these {disfmarker}
Turn 1702, D (Undergrad): And it {disfmarker} and the f the five thousand for the wires , so if I 'm gonna do {disfmarker} No .
Turn 1703, B (PhD): Yeah ,
Turn 1704, D (Undergrad): It 's a joke .
Turn 1705, B (PhD): that 's true
Turn 1706, D (Undergrad): I have to do {disfmarker}
Turn 1707, B (PhD): but we haven't spent that , right ? But once we {disfmarker} once we 've done the intellectual part of these , uh , we can just knock them out , right ?
Turn 1708, A (Grad): Cheap .
Turn 1709, B (PhD): We can start {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} you can make a hundred of them or something .
Turn 1710, D (Undergrad): Oh , of the {disfmarker} of the boards ? Yeah , yeah , sure , right .
Turn 1711, B (PhD): And then we could {disfmarker} Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had {disfmarker} what 's based on these
Turn 1712, D (Undergrad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1713, B (PhD): and it would cost {disfmarker}
Turn 1714, A (Grad): A PC and a peanuts .
Turn 1715, D (Undergrad): Peanuts .
Turn 1716, B (PhD): PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff .
Turn 1717, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1718, B (PhD): And that 's about {disfmarker} cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the {disfmarker} Oh th {vocalsound} the P Z
Turn 1719, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 1720, B (PhD): P Z Ms cost a lot . But anyway you 'd save , on the seven {disfmarker} seven or eight thousand for the {disfmarker} for the wireless system . So actually that might be attractive .
Turn 1721, D (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 1722, A (Grad): Good .
Turn 1723, B (PhD): OK , I can move my thumb now .
Turn 1724, E (Postdoc): That 's a great idea .
Turn 1725, D (Undergrad): What ?
Turn 1726, E (Postdoc): It 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be thinking toward that .
Turn 1727, D (Undergrad): Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer .
Turn 1728, A (Grad): Well , actually shorten {disfmarker}
Turn 1729, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1730, A (Grad): There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits . And so most of the time no one 's talking so it shortens it dramatically . But {vocalsound} if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better . So .
Turn 1731, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1732, E (Postdoc): Oh . Hmm .
Turn 1733, D (Undergrad): It also helps if you talk in a monotone .
Turn 1734, A (Grad): Probably .
Turn 1735, D (Undergrad): Constant volume all the time .
Turn 1736, E (Postdoc): Oh , interesting . And shorter words .
Turn 1737, A (Grad): Shorter words .
Turn 1738, C (PhD): Now , shorter words wouldn't {disfmarker} would induce more dynamics , right ? You want to have {disfmarker}
Turn 1739, B (PhD): Yeah , but if the words are more predictable .
Turn 1740, A (Grad): How about if you just go " uh " ?
Turn 1741, C (PhD): Huh .
Turn 1742, D (Undergrad): Uh .
Turn 1743, E (Postdoc): That 's a long word !
Turn 1744, A (Grad): How do you spell that ?
Turn 1745, E (Postdoc): I don't know .
Turn 1746, A (Grad): OK , can you do one more round of digits ? Are we done talking ?
Turn 1747, D (Undergrad): Well it 's a choice {disfmarker} if we get a choice , let 's keep talking .
Turn 1748, A (Grad): Do we have more to talk about ?
Turn 1749, D (Undergrad): Sure . No , I 'm done .
Turn 1750, C (PhD): I 'm done .
Turn 1751, A (Grad): Are you done ?
Turn 1752, E (Postdoc): I 'm done ,
Turn 1753, A (Grad): I 'm done .
Turn 1754, E (Postdoc): yeah .
Turn 1755, C (PhD): Dan isn't but he 's not gonna say anything .
Turn 1756, D (Undergrad): But {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's a problem {disfmarker} a structural problem with this though . You really need an incentive at the end if you 're gonna do digits again . Like , you know , candy bars or something ,
Turn 1757, A (Grad): I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time .
Turn 1758, D (Undergrad): or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or or a little , uh {disfmarker} you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist .
Turn 1759, B (PhD): Mmm !
Turn 1760, E (Postdoc): Or both .
Turn 1761, D (Undergrad): Or both .
Turn 1762, B (PhD): Sorry .
Turn 1763, D (Undergrad): Eric , you and I win . We didn't make any mistakes .
Turn 1764, A (Grad): It 's harder at the end than at the beginning .
Turn 1765, E (Postdoc): We don't know that for sure , do we ?
Turn 1766, A (Grad): I should have mentioned that s uh , to pause between lines but {disfmarker}
Turn 1767, D (Undergrad): No , I know . I 'm just giving you a hard time .
Turn 1768, A (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer .
Turn 1769, B (PhD): Tha - tha
Turn 1770, E (Postdoc): But {disfmarker} I also think you said channel four
Turn 1771, A (Grad): Me .
Turn 1772, E (Postdoc): and I think you meant microphone four . And I think that 's a mistake .
Turn 1773, D (Undergrad): Very good . So Eric , you win . But the other thing is that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a colon for transcripts . And there shouldn't be a colon . Because see , everything else is stuff you fill in .
Turn 1774, B (PhD): Yeah , that 's been filled in for you .
Turn 1775, D (Undergrad): Right ? Automatically .
Turn 1776, B (PhD): But they 're in order !
Turn 1777, D (Undergrad): But real
Turn 1778, B (PhD): They start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine .
Turn 1779, D (Undergrad): Where 'd they come from ?
Turn 1780, B (PhD): And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are {disfmarker} have the numbers in digits .
Turn 1781, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1782, B (PhD): And so they 're actually {disfmarker} this is like all the {disfmarker} all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something .
Turn 1783, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1784, B (PhD): And then within MPJ they 're sorted by what he actually said .
Turn 1785, A (Grad): Ugh ! I didn't know that . I should have randomized it .
Turn 1786, E (Postdoc): Wow .
Turn 1787, B (PhD): It doesn't matter ! It 's like {disfmarker} Cuz you said " six , seven , eight " .
Turn 1788, D (Undergrad): Well , we think it doesn't matter .
Turn 1789, B (PhD): We think it doesn't matter . If I {disfmarker} if not I {disfmarker}
Turn 1790, D (Undergrad): But the real question I have is that , why bother with these ?
Turn 1791, E (Postdoc): Oh , interesting .
Turn 1792, D (Undergrad): Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know ? Like phone numbers , you know , social security numbers .
Turn 1793, B (PhD): Cuz we have these writt written down , right ?
Turn 1794, A (Grad): Because {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 1795, B (PhD): That 's why {disfmarker}
Turn 1796, A (Grad): If we have it , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1797, D (Undergrad): I know .
Turn 1798, E (Postdoc): Social security numbers .
Turn 1799, D (Undergrad): I kn
Turn 1800, A (Grad): we don't have to transcribe .
Turn 1801, B (PhD): You can {disfmarker} you can generate {disfmarker}
Turn 1802, E (Postdoc): Bank account numbers .
Turn 1803, D (Undergrad): Credit card numbers ,
Turn 1804, A (Grad): We don't have to tran
Turn 1805, D (Undergrad): yeah .
Turn 1806, A (Grad): Yeah , please .
Turn 1807, B (PhD): Yeah . That 's a great idea .
Turn 1808, E (Postdoc): Passport numbers .
Turn 1809, D (Undergrad): Yeah , so you just say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} say your credit card numbers , say your phone numbers , say your mother 's maiden name .
Turn 1810, A (Grad): Bet we could do it .
Turn 1811, D (Undergrad): You know pe
Turn 1812, E (Postdoc): Password to your account .
Turn 1813, D (Undergrad): people off the street .
Turn 1814, E (Postdoc): Go on .
Turn 1815, D (Undergrad): This {disfmarker}
Turn 1816, A (Grad): Actually , this {disfmarker} I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora .
Turn 1817, B (PhD): Alright .
Turn 1818, A (Grad): So . We can compare directly .
Turn 1819, B (PhD): Looks good . Looks like there were no errors .
Turn 1820, E (Postdoc): I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the reason I made my mistake was {disfmarker}
Turn 1821, A (Grad): What ?
Turn 1822, E (Postdoc): Wa - was this {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1823, B (PhD): There were no {disfmarker} there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good .
Turn 1824, A (Grad): Great .
Turn 1825, E (Postdoc): Good news .
Turn 1826, A (Grad): OK , the mike 's off .
Turn 1827, B (PhD): So I 'm gonna stop it . Yeah , OK .
Turn 1828, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1829, A (Grad): Thank you all .
Turn 1830, D (Undergrad): Mony on the mike .
Turn 1831, B (PhD): Uh - oh .
