The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more. That is the principle.\n              In fact, we propose that over the $1,000 no-penalty limit, half of the earnings be exempt from penalty.

They can increase those transfers to ensure long-term care is adequately funded. \n              We could also ensure that there's a national care guarantee, working with provinces to ensure that we are meeting the best standards.

Thank you."}, {"turn": 393, "speakerID": "261817", "name": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "contribution": "I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions.\n              \n              Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. \n              Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. \n              This committee is now adjourned."}]}
