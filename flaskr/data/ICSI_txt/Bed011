Turn 0, C (Grad): Now can you give me the uh {pause} remote T ?
Turn 1, D (Professor): OK , so Eva , co uh {disfmarker} could you read your numbers ?
Turn 2, A (Grad): Go ahead and read . OK .
Turn 3, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 4, C (Grad): Alright .
Turn 5, D (Professor): Yeah , let 's get started . Um {disfmarker} Hopefully Nancy will come , if not , she won't .
Turn 6, B (Grad): Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every {disfmarker} uh , it seems to have about at two minute {disfmarker}
Turn 7, C (Grad): Yeah , I 've {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} it 's not that I didn't try .
Turn 8, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 9, C (Grad): and um I {disfmarker} I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands .
Turn 10, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 11, C (Grad): It has a mind .
Turn 12, B (Grad): Got it .
Turn 13, C (Grad): But I I just {disfmarker} You know , sort of keep on wiggling .
Turn 14, E (Undergrad): Wants to conserve .
Turn 15, B (Grad): Yeah , OK .
Turn 16, C (Grad): But uh {disfmarker} we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen . We 'll see . Should we plunge right into it ?
Turn 17, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 18, C (Grad): So , would you like to {disfmarker}
Turn 19, D (Professor): I think so .
Turn 20, C (Grad): So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this {pause} side . Commented and {disfmarker} what they 're about and sort of {disfmarker} the properties we may um give them . And here are the uh {disfmarker} tasks to be implemented via our data collection . So all of these tasks {disfmarker} The reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um {disfmarker} intention . And these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . Analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and {pause} that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so {disfmarker} trying to im um {disfmarker} implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .
Turn 21, D (Professor): Right , right .
Turn 22, C (Grad): But I think that might be overdoing it a little .
Turn 23, D (Professor): So {disfmarker} Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh {disfmarker} in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less . And {disfmarker} depending on what Fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .
Turn 24, C (Grad): Well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,
Turn 25, D (Professor): So {disfmarker} Fo - v yeah people with the {disfmarker} phrase them
Turn 26, C (Grad): huh ?
Turn 27, D (Professor): and so {disfmarker} Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh {disfmarker} we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh {pause} things that {disfmarker} that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . So the uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . So if {disfmarker} if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . And he has a handout .
Turn 28, C (Grad): Yeah . Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .
Turn 29, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 30, C (Grad): Um you can look at this if you want , these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . Any comments I can {disfmarker} can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .
Turn 31, E (Undergrad): m {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes .
Turn 32, C (Grad): Let me summarize in two sentences , mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all .
Turn 33, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 34, C (Grad): Or have you heard about it ?
Turn 35, A (Grad): Not that much you didn't .
Turn 36, C (Grad): No . OK . We were gonna put this in front of people . They give us some information on themselves .
Turn 37, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 38, C (Grad): Then {disfmarker} then they will read uh {disfmarker} a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between . And um {disfmarker} and they have to read isolated proper names And these change {disfmarker}
Turn 39, D (Professor): S I don't see a release
Turn 40, C (Grad): No , this is not the release form . This is the speaker information form .
Turn 41, D (Professor): Got it . OK , fine . OK .
Turn 42, C (Grad): The release form is over there in that box .
Turn 43, D (Professor): Alright , fair enough .
Turn 44, C (Grad): And um {disfmarker} And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . They {disfmarker} they pick a couple , say three {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh six as a matter of fact . Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} and they have a map .
Turn 45, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 46, C (Grad): Like this . Very sketchy , simplified map . And they can take notes on that map . And then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything .
Turn 47, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 48, C (Grad): And um {disfmarker}
Turn 49, B (Grad): This is a fictional system obviously ,
Turn 50, C (Grad): The comp Yeah , the computer system sits right in front of you ,
Turn 51, B (Grad): huh .
Turn 52, C (Grad): that 's Fey .
Turn 53, E (Undergrad): I 've {disfmarker} I understand everything .
Turn 54, D (Professor): And she does know everything .
Turn 55, E (Undergrad): Yes I do .
Turn 56, C (Grad): And she has a way of making this machine talk . So she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that . So if you ask " How do I get to the castle " then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here " In order to get to the castle you do {disfmarker} "
Turn 57, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 58, C (Grad): OK ? And um {disfmarker} And then after three tasks the system breaks down . And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator . And says " Sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . " And we sort of get the idea what people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human , or know , or assume they speak to a human .
Turn 59, A (Grad): OK . Huh .
Turn 60, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 61, C (Grad): That 's the data collection . And um {disfmarker} And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? Something ?
Turn 62, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 63, C (Grad): And um {disfmarker} And they 're {disfmarker} r ready uh {disfmarker} to roll .
Turn 64, E (Undergrad): And more and more every day .
Turn 65, C (Grad): And we 're gonna start tomorrow at three ? four ? one ?
Turn 66, E (Undergrad): Tomorrow , well we don't know for sure . Because we don't know whether that person is coming or not ,
Turn 67, C (Grad): OK . Around four - ish .
Turn 68, E (Undergrad): but {disfmarker}
Turn 69, C (Grad): And um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . Um {disfmarker} behind our backs . But {disfmarker}
Turn 70, D (Professor): Well , there are these {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} oh , I see , we have to {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's tricky . We 'll {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} let {disfmarker} we 'll do that off - line , OK .
Turn 71, C (Grad): Yeah , but I {disfmarker} i i it 's happening . David and {disfmarker} and Jane and {disfmarker} and Lila are working on that as we speak .
Turn 72, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 73, C (Grad): OK . That was the uh {disfmarker} the data collection in a nutshell . And um {disfmarker} I can report a {disfmarker} so I did this but I also tried to do this {disfmarker} so if I click on here , Isn't this wonderful ? we get to the uh {disfmarker} uh belief - net just focusing on {disfmarker} on the g Go - there node . uh {disfmarker} Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth .
Turn 74, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 75, C (Grad): And what w what happened is that um design - wise I 'd sort of n noticed that we can {disfmarker} we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes . So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . How much will he {disfmarker} is he willing to spend ? Or can spend . Being the same at this {disfmarker} just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there if it is {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e whatever . Twenty - two million to fly to International Space Station , you know . just {disfmarker} Not all people can do that .
Turn 76, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 77, C (Grad): So , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} intermediate level Um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here {disfmarker} let 's go to our favorite endpoint one is again more or less {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} then the situation nodes contributing to the {disfmarker} the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth . um {disfmarker} I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it g of course goes where the sub - S {disfmarker} everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - U , and whatever we specify for the so - called " Keith node " , or the discourse , what comes from the {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the D and the ontology to the sub - O node . And um one just s sort of has to watch which {disfmarker} also final decision node so it doesn't make sense {disfmarker} t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place . But this makes the design thing fairly simple . And um now all w that 's left to do then is the CPG 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of a person having enough money , actually wanting to go a place if it costs , you know this or that . And um {disfmarker} OK . and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing . You get involved in that process too . And um {disfmarker} And for now uh the {disfmarker} the question is " How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? " So {disfmarker} Um , one could {disfmarker} sort of {disfmarker} think of {disfmarker} you know we could call the z see or {disfmarker} you know , people who visit the zoo we could s call it " Visit the zoo tomorrow " , so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now {disfmarker} but later .
Turn 78, D (Professor): Right . Yeah . Yeah , so {disfmarker} let 's s uh s see I th I think that from one point of view , Uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d That , um {disfmarker} in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . And um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . Um are all big - ish things that um {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine .
Turn 79, C (Grad): Hmm . Hmm , hmm . Yeah {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the reason why we did it that way , as a {disfmarker} as a reminder , is uh {disfmarker} no person is gonna do all of them .
Turn 80, D (Professor): And {disfmarker}
Turn 81, C (Grad): They 're just gonna select u um , according to their preferences .
Turn 82, D (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 83, C (Grad): " Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit castles , or I usually {disfmarker} " And then you pick that one .
Turn 84, D (Professor): Right , no no , but {disfmarker} but s th point is to {disfmarker} to y to {disfmarker} build a system that 's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing .
Turn 85, E (Undergrad): They 're redundant .
Turn 86, D (Professor): T to build a system that um {disfmarker} had the most data on a relatively confined set of things , you do something else . And the speech people , for example , are gonna do better if they {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} things come up uh {disfmarker} repeatedly . Now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting . So , all I 'm saying is i th there 's {disfmarker} there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish . and {disfmarker} I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh , you know {disfmarker} And each person is only gonna do it once , so you don't have to worry about them being bored , so if {disfmarker} if it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , um {disfmarker} then my guess is that {disfmarker} that the data is going to be easier to handle . Now of course you have this I guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff , um {disfmarker} but I guess I 'm {disfmarker} I uh m my temptation is to go for simpler . You know , less variation . But I don't know what other people think about this in terms of {disfmarker}
Turn 87, B (Grad): So I don't exactly understand {disfmarker}
Turn 88, D (Professor): uh {disfmarker}
Turn 89, B (Grad): like I I {disfmarker} I guess we 're trying to {disfmarker} limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , right ? But who is it that has to care about this , or what component of the system ?
Turn 90, D (Professor): Oh , well , uh {disfmarker} th I think there are two places where it comes up . One is uh {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} th these people who are gonna take this and {disfmarker} and try to do speech with it .
Turn 91, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 92, D (Professor): uh {disfmarker} Lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you better data than l you know , a few pronunciations of lots more things .
Turn 93, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 94, D (Professor): That 's one .
Turn 95, B (Grad): So we would rather just ask {disfmarker} uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo , uh and assume that that will {disfmarker} that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places .
Turn 96, D (Professor): Bigger {disfmarker} Y yeah thi well this is a question for {disfmarker}
Turn 97, B (Grad): And that way you get the speech data of people saying " zoo " over and over again or whatever too .
Turn 98, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 99, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 100, D (Professor): Yeah . So this is a question for you ,
Turn 101, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 102, D (Professor): and , you know , if we {disfmarker} if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype , uh probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway . So , Um {disfmarker}
Turn 103, C (Grad): Yeah , the this was sort of {disfmarker} these are all different sort of activities . Um But I think y I {disfmarker} I got the point and I think I like it . We can do {disfmarker} put them in a more hierarchical fashion . So , " Go to place " and then give them a choice , you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say " yeah this is {disfmarker} on that " go to big - ish place " ,
Turn 104, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 105, C (Grad): this is what I would do . " And then we have the " Fix " thing , and then maybe " Do something the other day " thing , so . My question is {disfmarker} I guess , to some extent , we should {disfmarker} y we just have to try it out and see if it works . It would be challenging , in {disfmarker} in a sense , to try to make it so {disfmarker} so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex thing in terms of OK , you know , they should get the feeling that there are these s six things they have to do and they sh can be done maybe in two days .
Turn 106, D (Professor): Well {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 107, C (Grad): So they make these decisions ,
Turn 108, D (Professor): Well I think th th
Turn 109, C (Grad): " Can I go there tomorrow ? "
Turn 110, D (Professor): yeah .
Turn 111, C (Grad): or {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} influences
Turn 112, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 113, D (Professor): Yeah . Well , I think it 's easy enough to set that up if that 's your expectation . So , the uh system could say , " Well , uh we 'd like to {disfmarker} to set up your program for two days in Heidelberg , you know , let 's first think about all the things you might like to do . So there {disfmarker} th i i in {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} I th I {disfmarker} I 'm sure that if that 's what you did then they would start telling you about that , and then you could get into um various things about ordering , if you wanted .
Turn 114, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job . And that can be done , sort of to say , " OK now we 've picked these six tasks . " " Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . "
Turn 115, D (Professor): I 'm sorry .
Turn 116, C (Grad): And th w
Turn 117, D (Professor): No , we have to help {disfmarker} we have to decide . Fey will p carry out whatever we decide . But we have to decide you know , what is the appropriate scenario . That 's what we 're gonna talk about t yeah .
Turn 118, C (Grad): Yep , yep .
Turn 119, F (PhD): But these are two different scenarios entirely . I mean , one is a planner {disfmarker} The other , it kind of give you instructions on the spot
Turn 120, C (Grad): Yeah , but th the {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I 'm not really interested in sort of " Phase planning " capabilities . But it 's more the {disfmarker} how do people phrase these planning requests ? So are we gonna masquerade the system as this {disfmarker} as you said simple response system , " I have one question I get one response " , or should we allow for a certain level of complexity . And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references .
Turn 121, D (Professor): Well , so Keith , what do you think ?
Turn 122, B (Grad): Well , um it seems that {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want , you know , richer data , more complex stuff going on , people trying to do more complex sets of things . I mean {pause} you know , if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic {disfmarker} more interesting linguistic stuff . But I mean {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure Uh , because I don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet .
Turn 123, C (Grad): I mean w we have tested this and a y have you heard {disfmarker} listen to the f first two or th as a matter of fact the second person is uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} was faced with exactly this kind of setup .
Turn 124, B (Grad): I started to listen to one and it was just like , um , uh , sort of depressing .
Turn 125, C (Grad): And {disfmarker}
Turn 126, B (Grad): I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . And .
Turn 127, C (Grad): Oh , OK . That was the first subject .
Turn 128, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 129, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 130, D (Professor): First one wasn't very good .
Turn 131, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 132, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 133, B (Grad): So um , I {disfmarker}
Turn 134, C (Grad): Um , it is {disfmarker} already with this it got pretty {disfmarker} with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex .
Turn 135, E (Undergrad): Although {disfmarker}
Turn 136, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 137, C (Grad): Maybe {disfmarker} I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get {disfmarker} sort of {disfmarker} run through ten or so subjects
Turn 138, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 139, C (Grad): and then take a breather , and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what {disfmarker} what sort of results we 're getting .
Turn 140, B (Grad): Right . Yeah . It {disfmarker} In fact , um , I am just you know {disfmarker} today , next couple days gonna start really diving into this data . I 've basically looked at one of the files {disfmarker} you know one of these {disfmarker} l y y y you gave me those dozens of files and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences , found fifteen , twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on and like , " alright , well , let 's start here . " Um . So I haven't really gone into the , you know {disfmarker} looked at all of the stuff that 's going on . So I don't really {disfmarker} Right , I mean , once I start doing that I 'll have more to say about this kind of thing .
Turn 141, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 142, C (Grad): And y and always {disfmarker}
Turn 143, D (Professor): But well th but you did say something important , which is that um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh {disfmarker} with the simple cases for quite a while .
Turn 144, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 145, D (Professor): Although , obviously th so {disfmarker} so that sa s does suggest that {disfmarker} Uh , now , I have looked at all the data , and it 's pre it 's actually at least to an amateur , quite redundant .
Turn 146, B (Grad): Yeah , Yeah .
Turn 147, D (Professor): That {disfmarker} that it was {disfmarker} it was very stylized , and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing .
Turn 148, B (Grad): I um {disfmarker} I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them .
Turn 149, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 150, B (Grad): But yeah , yeah I noticed that , too .
Turn 151, D (Professor): So , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna do more than that .
Turn 152, C (Grad): And with this we 're getting more . No question .
Turn 153, D (Professor): OK . Right . So {disfmarker}
Turn 154, C (Grad): uh w do we wanna get going beyond more , which is sort of the {disfmarker}
Turn 155, D (Professor): Well , OK , so let 's {disfmarker} let 's take {disfmarker} let 's I {disfmarker} I think your suggestion is good , which is we 'll do a b uh {disfmarker} a batch . OK . And , uh , Fey , How long is it gonna be till you have ten subjects ? Couple days ? Or thr f a A week ? Or {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a feel for th
Turn 156, E (Undergrad): Um {disfmarker} I can {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean I s I think can probably schedule ten people , uh , whenever .
Turn 157, D (Professor): Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's up to you , I mean I j I {disfmarker} uh e We don't have any huge time pressure . It 's just {disfmarker} when you have t
Turn 158, E (Undergrad): How long will it be ?
Turn 159, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 160, E (Undergrad): Um {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would say maybe two weeks .
Turn 161, D (Professor): Oh , OK . So let 's do this . Let 's plan next Monday , OK , to have a review of what we have so far .
Turn 162, C (Grad): This means audio , but {disfmarker}
Turn 163, D (Professor): and {disfmarker} Huh ?
Turn 164, C (Grad): no transcriptions of course , yeah .
Turn 165, D (Professor): No , we won't have the transcriptions , but what we should be able to do and I don't know if , Fey , if you will have time to do this , but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . I mean we could lis uh {disfmarker} just sit here and listen to it all . Are you gonna have the audio on the web site ? OK .
Turn 166, C (Grad): Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s ki kills me . And we 're gonna put it on the web site . Yeah .
Turn 167, D (Professor): Oh , we could get {disfmarker} I mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , right ? I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like {disfmarker} OK . So , we 'll take care of David Johnson .
Turn 168, C (Grad): No , he {disfmarker} uh , he {disfmarker} he has been solving all our problems or {disfmarker} is wonderful ,
Turn 169, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 170, E (Undergrad): Take {disfmarker} care of him .
Turn 171, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 172, C (Grad): so s
Turn 173, D (Professor): Alright . So we 'll buy a disk . But anyway , so , um , If you {disfmarker} if you can think of a way {disfmarker} to uh , point us to th to interesting things , sort of as you 're doing this or {disfmarker} or something uh , make your {disfmarker} make notes or something that {disfmarker} that this is , you know , something worth looking at . And other than that , yeah I guess we 'll just have to uh , listen {disfmarker} although I guess it 's only ten minutes each , right ? Roughly .
Turn 174, E (Undergrad): Well , I guess . I 'm not sure how long it 's actually going to take .
Turn 175, C (Grad): The reading task is a lot shorter . That was cut by fifty percent . And the reading , nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people .
Turn 176, D (Professor): Right . No , we don't care about that at all .
Turn 177, C (Grad): So . It 's actually like five minutes dialogue .
Turn 178, D (Professor): I b My guess is it 's gonna be ten .
Turn 179, C (Grad): Ten minutes is long .
Turn 180, D (Professor): People {disfmarker} I understand , but people {disfmarker} people {disfmarker} you know uh {disfmarker}
Turn 181, E (Undergrad): It feels like a long time
Turn 182, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 183, E (Undergrad): but .
Turn 184, C (Grad): It feels like forever when you 're doing it ,
Turn 185, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 186, C (Grad): but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds .
Turn 187, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 188, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 189, D (Professor): Could be . OK . I was thinking people would , you know , hesitate and {disfmarker} Whatever . Whatever it is we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll deal with it .
Turn 190, C (Grad): Yeah , it 's not {disfmarker} And it 's fun .
Turn 191, D (Professor): OK , so that 'll be {disfmarker} that 'll be {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on the web page .
Turn 192, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 193, D (Professor): That 's great . Um But anyway {disfmarker} yeah , so I think {disfmarker} it 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system . And then if we want to uh {disfmarker} get them to start doing {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an um tell them which things are near each other and {disfmarker} you know , any of that stuff . uh {disfmarker} You know , " Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning ? "
Turn 194, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 195, D (Professor): So yeah I {disfmarker} th that seems {disfmarker} pretty straight forward .
Turn 196, E (Undergrad): But were you saying that {disfmarker}
Turn 197, C (Grad): I need those back by the way .
Turn 198, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 199, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 200, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 201, C (Grad): That 's for {disfmarker}
Turn 202, D (Professor): I 'm sorry , Fey , what ?
Turn 203, E (Undergrad): That w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ?
Turn 204, D (Professor): That 's what I was suggesting for the first round , yeah .
Turn 205, E (Undergrad): OK .
Turn 206, B (Grad): So rather than having zoo and castle .
Turn 207, E (Undergrad): And then , I mean , they could be alternate versions of the same {disfmarker} If you wanted data on different constructions .
Turn 208, D (Professor): They could , but i but i uh tha eh they c yeah , but {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Turn 209, E (Undergrad): Like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice , and the other person gets the {disfmarker}
Turn 210, D (Professor): You could , but i but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think in the short run , {disfmarker}
Turn 211, C (Grad): And no , th the per the person don't get it . I mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - A and three tasks for part - B a
Turn 212, D (Professor): Right . Yeah .
Turn 213, E (Undergrad): Well no , they could still choose . They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle .
Turn 214, C (Grad): Exactly . This is limiting the choices , but yeah . Right . OK , sorry . But um I {disfmarker} I think this approach will very well work , but the person was able to look at it and say " OK , This is what I would actually do . "
Turn 215, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 216, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 217, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 218, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 219, E (Undergrad): He was vicious .
Turn 220, C (Grad): OK , we gotta {disfmarker} we gotta disallow uh {disfmarker} traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time , sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 221, E (Undergrad): I mean there {disfmarker} they are significantly different , but .
Turn 222, C (Grad): But no , they 're {disfmarker} I mean they 're sort of {disfmarker} this is where tour becomes {disfmarker} you know tourists maybe a bit different
Turn 223, E (Undergrad): Yeah , I guess so .
Turn 224, C (Grad): and , um , these are just places where you {disfmarker} you enter um , much like here .
Turn 225, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 226, C (Grad): But we can uh {disfmarker}
Turn 227, D (Professor): Yeah , in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each in common , like at you know , " attend a theater , symphony or opera " is {disfmarker} is a group , and " tour the university , castle or zoo " ,
Turn 228, C (Grad): mm - hmm Yeah .
Turn 229, D (Professor): all of these d do have this kind of " tour " um {disfmarker} aspect about the way you would go to them . And uh , the movie theater is probably also uh {disfmarker} e is a " attend " et cetera .
Turn 230, C (Grad): Attend , yeah .
Turn 231, D (Professor): So it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things ,
Turn 232, C (Grad): Hmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 233, D (Professor): and then , what one would expect is that {disfmarker} that the sentence types would {disfmarker} uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect .
Turn 234, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 235, F (PhD): But I mean i it seem that um {disfmarker} there is a difference between going {disfmarker} to see something , and things like " exchange money " or " dine out "
Turn 236, D (Professor): Oh , absolutely . Yeah .
Turn 237, F (PhD): uh {disfmarker} @ @ function , yeah .
Turn 238, C (Grad): Yeah , this is where {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff {disfmarker} yeah . OK . But this is open . So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy . And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense . And um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with {disfmarker} or with a computer . And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always {disfmarker} just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection . We 're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it .
Turn 239, D (Professor): We don't have enough .
Turn 240, C (Grad): No . But it seems like since we {disfmarker} since we are getting towards uh subject {disfmarker} uh fifty subjects and if we can keep it up um to a {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago .
Turn 241, E (Undergrad): That means that one hundred people have to be interested .
Turn 242, B (Grad): Good luck .
Turn 243, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 244, D (Professor): Well , um , these are all f people off campus s from campus so far ,
Turn 245, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 246, D (Professor): right ?
Turn 247, E (Undergrad): Yeah .
Turn 248, D (Professor): So we {disfmarker} yeah we don't know how many we can get next door at the {disfmarker} uh shelter for example .
Turn 249, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 250, D (Professor): Uh for ten bucks , probably quite a few .
Turn 251, B (Grad): Yeah . That 's right .
Turn 252, D (Professor): Yeah . So , alright , so let 's go {disfmarker} let 's go back then , to the {disfmarker} the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see how we 're doing .
Turn 253, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 254, D (Professor): Do {disfmarker} do people think that , you know this is {disfmarker} is gonna {disfmarker} um cover what we need , or should we be thinking about more ?
Turn 255, C (Grad): Okay , in terms of decision nodes ? I mean , Go - there is {disfmarker} is a yes or no .
Turn 256, D (Professor): Yep .
Turn 257, C (Grad): Right ?
Turn 258, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 259, D (Professor): Yep .
Turn 260, C (Grad): I 'm also interested in th in this " property " uh line here , so if you look at {disfmarker} sorry , look at that um , timing was um {disfmarker} I have these three . Do we need a final differentiation there ? Now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour .
Turn 261, B (Grad): What 's this idea of " next tour " ? I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 262, C (Grad): It 's sort of next day , so you 're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things ,
Turn 263, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 264, C (Grad): and you can do something immediately ,
Turn 265, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 266, C (Grad): you could sort of tag it on to that tour
Turn 267, B (Grad): Or {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 268, C (Grad): or you can say this is something I would do s I wanna do sometime l in my life , basically .
Turn 269, B (Grad): OK . OK . So {disfmarker} so this tour is sort of just like th the idea of current s round of {disfmarker} of touristness or whatever ,
Turn 270, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 271, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 272, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , probably between stops back at the hotel .
Turn 273, B (Grad): OK . Got it .
Turn 274, D (Professor): I mean if you {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you wanted precise about it , uh you know ,
Turn 275, B (Grad): Got it .
Turn 276, D (Professor): uh {disfmarker} and I think that 's the way tourists do organize their lives .
Turn 277, B (Grad): Sure , sure , sure .
Turn 278, D (Professor): You know , " OK , we 'll go back to the hotel and then we 'll go off
Turn 279, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 280, D (Professor): and {disfmarker} "
Turn 281, F (PhD): So all tours {disfmarker} b a tour happens only within one day ?
Turn 282, D (Professor): Yes .
Turn 283, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 284, D (Professor): It {disfmarker}
Turn 285, F (PhD): So the next tour will be tomorrow ?
Turn 286, D (Professor): Right . For this .
Turn 287, B (Grad): OK . Just to be totally clear . OK .
Turn 288, C (Grad): Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel , so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to {vocalsound} think .
Turn 289, B (Grad): You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something ,
Turn 290, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 291, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} w we will {disfmarker} we will not ask you more .
Turn 292, B (Grad): ri
Turn 293, E (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 294, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 295, E (Undergrad): That 's enough .
Turn 296, C (Grad): I don't know . What is the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the English co uh um cognate if you want , for " Sankt Nimmerlandstag " ?
Turn 297, B (Grad): Keine Ahnung
Turn 298, C (Grad): Sort of " We 'll do it on {disfmarker} when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .
Turn 299, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 300, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 301, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 302, C (Grad): Do you have an expression ? Probably you sh
Turn 303, B (Grad): Not that I know of actually .
Turn 304, C (Grad): Yeah , when hell {disfmarker} Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over .
Turn 305, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 306, C (Grad): So maybe that should be another {vocalsound} property in there .
Turn 307, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 308, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 309, E (Undergrad): Never .
Turn 310, D (Professor): No .
Turn 311, C (Grad): OK . Um , the reason why {disfmarker} why do we go there in the first place IE uh {disfmarker} it 's either uh {disfmarker} for sightseeing , for meeting people , for running errands , or doing business . Entertainment is a good one in there , I think . I agree .
Turn 312, B (Grad): So , business is supposed to uh , be sort of {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} like professional type stuff , right , or something like that ?
Turn 313, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 314, B (Grad): OK . Um .
Turn 315, C (Grad): I mean {disfmarker} this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing . He sort of had it in there . " Who is the {disfmarker} the tour is the person ? " So it might be a tourist ,
Turn 316, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 317, C (Grad): it might be a business man who 's using the system , who wants to sort of go to some {disfmarker}
Turn 318, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 319, D (Professor): Yeah , or {disfmarker} or both .
Turn 320, B (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , I mean like for example my {disfmarker} my father is about to travel to Prague .
Turn 321, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 322, B (Grad): He 'll be there for two weeks . He is going to uh {disfmarker} He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things .
Turn 323, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 324, D (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 325, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 326, D (Professor): Sure . Right .
Turn 327, C (Grad): He would {disfmarker}
Turn 328, F (PhD): What ab What do you have in mind in terms of um {disfmarker} socializing ? What kind of activities ?
Turn 329, C (Grad): Eh , just meeting people , basically . " I want to meet someone somewhere " , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the " EVA "
Turn 330, F (PhD): Oh {disfmarker}
Turn 331, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 332, C (Grad): you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually , you 're just {disfmarker} want to approach it .
Turn 333, B (Grad): So {disfmarker} I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put {disfmarker} " Exchange money " is an errand , right ? But what about uh {disfmarker}
Turn 334, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 335, D (Professor): Mm - hmm
Turn 336, B (Grad): So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment , " Dine out " is {disfmarker}
Turn 337, F (PhD): Socializing , I guess .
Turn 338, D (Professor): No , I I well , I dunno . Let {disfmarker} Let {disfmarker} well , we 'll put it somewhere ,
Turn 339, B (Grad): So I mean {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 340, D (Professor): but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I would say that if " Dine out " is a special c uh {disfmarker} if you 're doing it for that purpose then it 's entertainment .
Turn 341, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 342, D (Professor): And {disfmarker} we 'll also as y as you 'll s further along we 'll get into business about " Well , you 're {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} this is going over a meal time , do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? "
Turn 343, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 344, D (Professor): And that 's different . That 's {disfmarker} that 's sort of part of th that 's not a destination reason , that 's sort of " en passant , " right .
Turn 345, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 346, C (Grad): That goes with the " energy depletion " function , blech .
Turn 347, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 348, D (Professor): Right , yeah .
Turn 349, C (Grad): OK , " endpoint " .
Turn 350, B (Grad): " Tourist needs food , badly "
Turn 351, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 352, C (Grad): " Endpoint " is pretty clear . Um , " mode " , uh , I have found three , " drive there " , " walk there " uh {disfmarker} or " be driven " , which means bus , taxi , BART .
Turn 353, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 354, C (Grad): Yeah . Yep .
Turn 355, D (Professor): Obviously taxis are very different than buses , but on the other hand the system doesn't have any public transport {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet .
Turn 356, C (Grad): So this granularity would suffice , I think w if we say the person probably , based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude wants to drive there , walk there , or use some other form of transportation .
Turn 357, B (Grad): H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ? I mean in terms of the interesting bits . There 's lots of bits where you don't really I 've only ev was there ten years ago , for a day , so I don't remember , but . I mean , like the {disfmarker} sort of the tourist - y bits {disfmarker}
Turn 358, D (Professor): Mm - Well ,
Turn 359, C (Grad): Everywhere .
Turn 360, B (Grad): is it like {disfmarker}
Turn 361, D (Professor): you can't get to the Philosophers ' Way very well ,
Turn 362, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 363, D (Professor): but , I mean there are hikes that you can't get to , but {disfmarker}
Turn 364, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 365, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 366, D (Professor): but I think other things you can , if I remember right .
Turn 367, A (Grad): So is like " biking there " {disfmarker} part of like " driving there " ,
Turn 368, C (Grad): Yeah , um we actually {disfmarker} biking should be {disfmarker} should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component .
Turn 369, A (Grad): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 370, C (Grad): So .
Turn 371, D (Professor): Oh !
Turn 372, E (Undergrad): Mmm g that 's good .
Turn 373, C (Grad): Um .
Turn 374, D (Professor): Put it in .
Turn 375, C (Grad): Bicycles c should be in there , but , will we have bic I mean is this realistic ? I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 376, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 377, D (Professor): OK , we can leave it out , I guess .
Turn 378, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 379, C (Grad): We can {disfmarker} we can sort of uh , drive {disfmarker}
Turn 380, B (Grad): I would {disfmarker} I would lump it with " walk " because hills matter .
Turn 381, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 382, B (Grad): Right ? You know . Things like that .
Turn 383, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 384, D (Professor): OK . Skateboards right , anyway .
Turn 385, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 386, D (Professor): Scooters ,
Turn 387, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 388, D (Professor): right ?
Turn 389, C (Grad): OK , " Length " is um , you wanna get this over with as fast as possible ,
Turn 390, D (Professor): Alright .
Turn 391, C (Grad): you wanna use some part of what {disfmarker} of the time you have . Um , they can . But we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time .
Turn 392, D (Professor): Ye
Turn 393, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 394, C (Grad): You know , they wanna do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh {disfmarker} you know the necessary and plus time . And um {disfmarker} And y you know , if we feel that they wanna do nothing but that thing then , you know , we should point out that {disfmarker} to the planner , that they probably want to use all the time they have . So , stretch out that visit for that .
Turn 395, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 396, B (Grad): Wow {disfmarker} It seems like this would be really hard to guess . I mean , on the part of the system . It seems like it {disfmarker} I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're talking about rather than having the user decide this you 're supposed t we 're supposed to figure it out ?
Turn 397, D (Professor): w well
Turn 398, C (Grad): Th - the user can always s say it , but it 's just sort of we {disfmarker} we hand over these parameters if we make {disfmarker} if we have a feeling that they are important .
Turn 399, B (Grad): Overrider
Turn 400, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 401, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 402, C (Grad): And that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask .
Turn 403, D (Professor): And {disfmarker}
Turn 404, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 405, D (Professor): And par yeah , and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out , then you ask .
Turn 406, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 407, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 408, D (Professor): But hopefully you don't ask you know , a all these things all the time .
Turn 409, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 410, D (Professor): Or {disfmarker} eh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking .
Turn 411, B (Grad): Yeah . Right . Yeah .
Turn 412, C (Grad): And if no {disfmarker} no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important , no planner is ever gonna ask for it .
Turn 413, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 414, C (Grad): y so {disfmarker} And I like the idea that , you know , sort of {disfmarker} Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t
Turn 415, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 416, C (Grad): If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ? And , Timing , uh , uh , Length would definitely be part of it , " Costs " , " Little money , some money , lots of money " ?
Turn 417, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 418, C (Grad): Actually , maybe uh F {comment} uh so , F Yeah , OK . Hmm ?
Turn 419, B (Grad): You could say " some " in there .
Turn 420, F (PhD): I must say that thi this one looks a bit strange to me . Um {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} It seems like appropriate if I go to Las Vegas . Well {disfmarker} but I decide k kind of how much money uh I 'm willing to lose . But a I as a tourist , I 'll just paying what 's {disfmarker} what 's more or less is required .
Turn 421, D (Professor): Well , no . I think there are {disfmarker} there 're different things where you have a ch choice ,
Turn 422, E (Undergrad): Mmm .
Turn 423, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 424, D (Professor): for example , uh this t interacts with " do am I do oh are you willing to take a taxi ? "
Turn 425, B (Grad): Dinner .
Turn 426, D (Professor): Or uh , you know , if {disfmarker} if you 're going to the opera are you gonna l look for the best seats or the peanut gallery
Turn 427, F (PhD): The best seat or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 428, D (Professor): or , you know ,
Turn 429, B (Grad): OK . So {disfmarker}
Turn 430, D (Professor): whatever ? S so I think there are a variety of things in which um {disfmarker} Tour - tourists really do have different styles eating . Another one ,
Turn 431, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 432, D (Professor): you know .
Turn 433, E (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 434, F (PhD): Right , that 's true .
Turn 435, C (Grad): The {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what my sort of sentiment is they 're {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I once had to write a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a charter , a carter for a {disfmarker} a student organization . And they had {disfmarker} wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be . And I looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it 's not a {disfmarker} And I wrote in there " En - Enough " people have to be there . And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people .
Turn 436, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 437, C (Grad): And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say " How much cheese do you want ? " and they say " Ah , enough . " And the {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} this used all over the place . Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough .
Turn 438, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 439, C (Grad): And um so the middle part is always sort of the {disfmarker} the golden way , right ? So you can s you can be really {disfmarker} make it as cheap as possible , or you can say " I want , er , you know , I don't care "
Turn 440, B (Grad): Money is no object . Mm - hmm .
Turn 441, C (Grad): Money is no object ,
Turn 442, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 443, C (Grad): or you say " I just want to spend enough " .
Turn 444, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 445, C (Grad): Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount .
Turn 446, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 447, C (Grad): But , Then again , this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes . But well , this is my first guess ,
Turn 448, B (Grad): I mean y Yeah .
Turn 449, C (Grad): in much the same way as how {disfmarker} how d you know {disfmarker} should the route be ? Should it be the easiest route , even if it 's a b little bit longer ?
Turn 450, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 451, C (Grad): No steep inclinations ? Go the normal way ? Whatever that again means , er {disfmarker} or do you {disfmarker} does the person wanna rough it ?
Turn 452, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . I mean {disfmarker} th so there 's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things right ? You know {disfmarker} " I want to go there and I don't care if it 's really hard . " Or if you 're an extreme sport person , you know . " I wanna go there and I insist on it being the hard way . "
Turn 453, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 454, B (Grad): Right ? you know , so I assume we 're going for the first interpretation ,
Turn 455, E (Undergrad): Right .
Turn 456, B (Grad): right ? Something like {disfmarker} I 'll go th I mean {disfmarker} I 'd li I dunno . It 's different from thing to {disfmarker}
Turn 457, D (Professor): No , I think he was going for the second one ar actually .
Turn 458, B (Grad): Yeah ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 459, D (Professor): Anyway , we 'll sort th yeah , we 'll sort that out .
Turn 460, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 461, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 462, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 463, D (Professor): Absolutely .
Turn 464, C (Grad): Well , this is all sort of um , top of my head .
Turn 465, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 466, C (Grad): No {disfmarker} no research behind that . Um {disfmarker} " Object information " , " Do I {disfmarker} do I wanna know anything about that object ? " is either true or false . And . if I care about it being open , accessible or not , I don't think there 's any middle ground there . Um , either I wanna know where it is or not , I wanna know about it 's history or not , or , um I wanna know about what it 's good for or not . Maybe one could put scales in there , too . So I wanna know a l lot about it .
Turn 467, D (Professor): Yeah , now ob OK , I 'm sorry , go ahead , what were you gonna say ?
Turn 468, C (Grad): One could put scales in there . So I wanna know a lot about the history , just a bit .
Turn 469, D (Professor): Yeah , right well y i w if we {disfmarker} w right . So " object " becomes " entity " , right ?
Turn 470, C (Grad): Yep , that 's true .
Turn 471, D (Professor): Yeah , but we don't have to do it now .
Turn 472, C (Grad): Yep . That was the wrong shortcut anyhow .
Turn 473, D (Professor): And we think that 's it , interestingly enough , that um , you know , th or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or something very close to it is going to be uh {disfmarker} going to be enough . And {disfmarker}
Turn 474, E (Undergrad): Still wrong .
Turn 475, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 476, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 477, D (Professor): Alright , so um {disfmarker} So I think the order of things is that um , Robert will clean this up a little bit , although it looks pretty good . And {disfmarker}
Turn 478, C (Grad): What , well this is the part that {disfmarker}
Turn 479, D (Professor): Huh ?
Turn 480, C (Grad): this is the part that needs the work .
Turn 481, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 482, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 483, D (Professor): Yeah , so {disfmarker} right , so {disfmarker} So , um In parallel , uh {disfmarker} three things are going to happen . Uh Robert and Eva and Bhaskara are gonna actually {disfmarker} build a belief - net that {disfmarker} that , um , has CPT 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information . And Fey is going to start collecting data , and we 're gonna start thinking a about {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} what constructions we want to elicit . And then w go it may iterate on uh , further data collection to elicit {disfmarker}
Turn 484, B (Grad): D Do you mean {disfmarker} Do you mean eliciting particular constructions ? Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about ? Semantically speaking , eh ?
Turn 485, D (Professor): Well , yes .
Turn 486, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 487, D (Professor): Both . Uh , and {disfmarker} Though for us , constructions are primarily semantic , right ?
Turn 488, B (Grad): Right . Sure .
Turn 489, D (Professor): And {disfmarker} And so {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}
Turn 490, B (Grad): I mean from my point of view I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to care about the syntax , so you know {disfmarker}
Turn 491, D (Professor): Well that too ,
Turn 492, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 493, D (Professor): but um {disfmarker} You know if th if we in {disfmarker} if we you know , make sure that we get them talking about temporal order .
Turn 494, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 495, D (Professor): OK , that would be great and if th if they use prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses or whatever ,
Turn 496, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Right . OK .
Turn 497, D (Professor): um {disfmarker} W You know , whatever form they use is fine .
Turn 498, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 499, D (Professor): But I {disfmarker} I think that probably we 're gonna try to look at it as you know , s what semantic constructions d do we {disfmarker} do we want them to uh do direc
Turn 500, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 501, D (Professor): you know , um , " Caused motion " , I don't know , something like that .
Turn 502, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 503, D (Professor): Uh But , Eh - uh this is actually a conversation you and I have to have about your thesis fantasies , and how all this fits into that .
Turn 504, B (Grad): Got it . Yeah . Uh Yeah . OK .
Turn 505, D (Professor): But uh {disfmarker}
Turn 506, C (Grad): Well , I will tell you the German tourist data .
Turn 507, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 508, C (Grad): Because I have not been able to dig out all the stuff out of the m ta thirty D V
Turn 509, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 510, C (Grad): Um {disfmarker} If you {disfmarker}
Turn 511, B (Grad): Is that roughly the equivalent of {disfmarker} of what I 've seen in English or is it {disfmarker}
Turn 512, C (Grad): No , not at all .
Turn 513, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 514, C (Grad): Dialogues . SmartKom {disfmarker}
Turn 515, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 516, C (Grad): SmartKom {disfmarker} Human . Wizard of Oz .
Turn 517, B (Grad): OK . Same {disfmarker} OK , that . Got it . Like what {disfmarker} What have I got now ? I mean I have uh what {disfmarker} what I 'm loo what I {disfmarker} Those files that you sent me are the user side of some interaction with Fey ?
Turn 518, C (Grad): A little bit of data , I {disfmarker}
Turn 519, B (Grad): Is that what it is ? Or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 520, C (Grad): With nothing .
Turn 521, B (Grad): Just talking into a box and not hearing anything back .
Turn 522, D (Professor): No , no .
Turn 523, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 524, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 525, C (Grad): Yep . Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when .
Turn 526, B (Grad): OK . OK .
Turn 527, C (Grad): Nothing to write home about .
Turn 528, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 529, C (Grad): And um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} see this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} ontology node is probably something that I will try to expand . Once we have the full ontology API , what can we expect to get from the ontology ? And hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know {disfmarker} or the {disfmarker}
Turn 530, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 531, C (Grad): not the discourse , the utterance as it were , uh ,
Turn 532, D (Professor): mm - hmm .
Turn 533, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 534, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 535, C (Grad): in terms of uh {disfmarker}
Turn 536, D (Professor): Right , but we 're not expecting Keith to actually build a parser .
Turn 537, B (Grad): Right , Right .
Turn 538, C (Grad): No , no , no , no , no .
Turn 539, D (Professor): OK . We are expecting Johno to build a parser ,
Turn 540, C (Grad): Uh , this is {disfmarker} Yes .
Turn 541, B (Grad): By the end of the summer , too .
Turn 542, D (Professor): but that 's a {disfmarker} No .
Turn 543, C (Grad): No .
Turn 544, D (Professor): No . Uh {disfmarker} He 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now .
Turn 545, C (Grad): But it 's sort of {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 546, B (Grad): Right . Hmm . Still , pretty formidable actually .
Turn 547, D (Professor): Eh - absolutely . Uh {disfmarker} limited . I mean , you know , the idea is {disfmarker} is ,
Turn 548, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 549, D (Professor): Well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust . But it 's not popular {disfmarker} it 's only p only {disfmarker}
Turn 550, B (Grad): Right , Right . Existence proof , you know . Set up the infrastructure ,
Turn 551, D (Professor): Right . It 's only popula
Turn 552, B (Grad): yeah .
Turn 553, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 554, B (Grad): Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from {disfmarker} sort of as general as argument structure constructions . Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . I have to do uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} unbounded dependencies , you know , which have a variety of constructions in {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} instantiate that . On the other hand I have to have , you know , there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like " Get " plus path expression for , you know , " how d ho how do I get there ? " ,
Turn 555, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 556, B (Grad): " How do I get in ? " , " How do I get away ? "
Turn 557, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 558, B (Grad): and all that kind of stuff . Um , so there 's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions
Turn 559, D (Professor): Absolutely .
Turn 560, B (Grad): and it {disfmarker} you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of like anything goes . Like {disfmarker}
Turn 561, D (Professor): OK , so this is {disfmarker} I think we 're gonna mainly work on with George .
Turn 562, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 563, D (Professor): OK , and hi let me f th {disfmarker} say what I think is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} so the idea is {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} first of all I misspoke when I said we thought you should do the constructions . Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly . So what I {disfmarker} yeah , OK , {disfmarker} So what {disfmarker} what I meant was " Do a first cut at " .
Turn 564, B (Grad): er {disfmarker} that 's what Yeah , yeah .
Turn 565, D (Professor): OK , Because uh {disfmarker} we do wanna get them r u perfectly {disfmarker} but I think we 're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .
Turn 566, B (Grad): Of course . Right , exactly . Now it {disfmarker} w we talked about this before , right . And I {disfmarker} I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer ,
Turn 567, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 568, B (Grad): but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like , so yeah .
Turn 569, D (Professor): Right . So the idea is going to be to do {disfmarker} sort of like Nancy did in some of the er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom {disfmarker} so you can do f you know , f f uh {disfmarker} have a complete story ov of s of some piece of dialogue .
Turn 570, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 571, D (Professor): And that 's gonna be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or something like that .
Turn 572, B (Grad): Yeah . Sure . Yeah .
Turn 573, D (Professor): So that the {disfmarker} the trick is going to be t to take this and pick a {disfmarker} some sort of lattice of constructions ,
Turn 574, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 575, D (Professor): so some lexical and some phrasal , and {disfmarker} and , you know ,
Turn 576, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 577, D (Professor): whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .
Turn 578, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 579, D (Professor): And so , exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things .
Turn 580, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Sure . OK . But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of uh {disfmarker} of analysis , you know , these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the " Out of " construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something .
Turn 581, D (Professor): Correct . Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah . V a half a page is {disfmarker} is what we 'd like .
Turn 582, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 583, D (Professor): And if {disfmarker} if there 's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does and we have to do it ,
Turn 584, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 585, D (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 586, B (Grad): For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah .
Turn 587, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 588, C (Grad): We could sit down and think of sort of the {disfmarker} the ideal speaker utterances ,
Turn 589, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 590, C (Grad): and I mean two or three that follow each other , so , where we can also sort of , once we have everything up and running , show the tremendous , insane inferencing capabilities of our system .
Turn 591, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 592, C (Grad): So , you know , as {disfmarker} as the SmartKom people have . This is sort of their standard demo dialogue , which is , you know , what the system survives and nothing but that .
Turn 593, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 594, C (Grad): Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of o our sample sentences , the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely .
Turn 595, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 596, C (Grad): So the {disfmarker} the " How do I get to X ? " ,
Turn 597, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 598, C (Grad): you know , that 's definitely gonna be uh , a major one .
Turn 599, B (Grad): Yeah . That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , {vocalsound} yeah .
Turn 600, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 601, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 602, C (Grad): " Where is X ? " might be another one which is not too complicated .
Turn 603, B (Grad): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 604, C (Grad): And um " Tell me something about X . "
Turn 605, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 606, C (Grad): And hey , that 's {disfmarker} that 's already covering eighty percent of the system 's functionality .
Turn 607, D (Professor): Ye - Right , but it 's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest .
Turn 608, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 609, C (Grad): No , we can w throw in an " Out of Film " construction if you want to , but {disfmarker}
Turn 610, D (Professor): No , no , no . Well the {disfmarker} th the thing is there 's a lot that needs to be done to get this right .
Turn 611, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 612, D (Professor): OK , I th We done ?
Turn 613, C (Grad): I have one bit of news .
Turn 614, D (Professor): Good .
Turn 615, C (Grad): Um , the action planner guy has wrote {disfmarker} has written a {disfmarker} a p lengthy {disfmarker} proposal on how he wants to do the action planning .
Turn 616, D (Professor): Good .
Turn 617, C (Grad): And I responded to him , also rather lengthy , how he should do the action planning . And {disfmarker}
Turn 618, D (Professor): " Action planning " meaning " Discourse Modeling " ?
Turn 619, C (Grad): Yes . And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that module a dis disc dialogue manager ,
Turn 620, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 621, C (Grad): and wouldn't it make sense to do this here too ?
Turn 622, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 623, C (Grad): And also Rainer M Malaka is going to be visiting us shortly , most likely in the beginning of June .
Turn 624, D (Professor): Uh - huh , I 'll be gone .
Turn 625, C (Grad): Yeah . He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town .
Turn 626, D (Professor): Sure , OK .
Turn 627, C (Grad): And um {disfmarker} m making me incapable of going to NAACL , for which I had funding . But . No , no Pittsburg this year .
Turn 628, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 629, C (Grad): When is the uh Santa Barbara ?
Turn 630, D (Professor): S
Turn 631, C (Grad): Who is going to ? uh should a lot of people . That 's something I will {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} sort of enjoy .
Turn 632, D (Professor): Probably should go . That was {disfmarker} that 's one you should probably go to .
Turn 633, C (Grad): Yep .
Turn 634, B (Grad): How much does it cost ?
Turn 635, C (Grad): There 's
Turn 636, B (Grad): I haven't planned to go .
Turn 637, D (Professor): Uh , probably we can uh {disfmarker} pay for it .
Turn 638, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 639, D (Professor): Um a student rate shouldn't be very high . So , if we all decide it 's a good idea for you to go then you 'll {disfmarker} we 'll pay for it .
Turn 640, B (Grad): Right . Sure .
Turn 641, E (Undergrad): Then you can go .
Turn 642, D (Professor): I mean I {disfmarker} I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment ,
Turn 643, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 644, D (Professor): but it probably is . OK , great .
Turn 645, B (Grad): Thanks .
