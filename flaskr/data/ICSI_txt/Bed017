Turn 0, A (Grad): Why ?
Turn 1, D (Grad): Um .
Turn 2, E (Grad): I 'm known . I {disfmarker}
Turn 3, A (Grad): No , cuz she already told me it , before she told you .
Turn 4, E (Grad): No , she told me a long time ago . She told me {disfmarker} she told me like two weeks ago .
Turn 5, A (Grad): Oh , well , it doesn't matter what time .
Turn 6, B (Grad): OK . You know how to toggle the display width {pause} function {disfmarker}
Turn 7, A (Grad): Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .
Turn 8, D (Grad): Wow .
Turn 9, A (Grad): Anyway .
Turn 10, D (Grad): What is it ?
Turn 11, E (Grad): Let me explain something to you .
Turn 12, D (Grad): Um ,
Turn 13, E (Grad): My laugh is better than yours .
Turn 14, D (Grad): there .
Turn 15, A (Grad): I beg to differ .
Turn 16, B (Grad): Yo .
Turn 17, D (Grad): Um , OK .
Turn 18, A (Grad): But you have to say something genuinely funny before you 'll get an example .
Turn 19, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 20, D (Grad): The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page . Here .
Turn 21, E (Grad): No . You should be {disfmarker} at least be self - satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes .
Turn 22, D (Grad): Actually I thought {disfmarker}
Turn 23, A (Grad): No , it 's a different laugh .
Turn 24, D (Grad): There .
Turn 25, A (Grad): Ooh , wow !
Turn 26, D (Grad): How weird .
Turn 27, E (Grad): Oh ! Holy mackerel .
Turn 28, A (Grad): Wow . Whoa !
Turn 29, D (Grad): What ? ! Oh . OK . I wasn't even doing anything . {vocalsound} OK .
Turn 30, A (Grad): Uh .
Turn 31, E (Grad): Eva 's got a laptop , she 's trying to show it off .
Turn 32, D (Grad): That was r actually Robert 's idea . But anyhow . Um
Turn 33, F (Professor): O K . So , here we are .
Turn 34, E (Grad): Once again .
Turn 35, F (Professor): Once again , right , together . Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and {disfmarker} and probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone . Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ?
Turn 36, B (Grad): Um , uh in a {disfmarker} in a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . If you 're interested in that , talk to me . Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us . Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round . She 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . So they have to be subjected , {vocalsound} {comment} before they can actually graduate . And um , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , um , sort of package the whole thing in a {disfmarker} in a re in a few more complicated um , structure . That 's for the data collection . As for SmartKom , I 'm {disfmarker} the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . And , so ,
Turn 37, F (Professor): Good .
Turn 38, B (Grad): " should be " means they aren't yet , but {disfmarker} but I think I have the info now that I need . Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're {disfmarker} we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there . That was that . Um , the uh , uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done . Um , something happened , in {disfmarker} on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and um , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy .
Turn 39, A (Grad): Sorry . Hi . Hi .
Turn 40, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 41, B (Grad): Hi . Hi .
Turn 42, A (Grad): So when you said " Andreas " I thought you were talking about Stolcke .
Turn 43, B (Grad): And , um ,
Turn 44, A (Grad): Now I know that we aren't , OK .
Turn 45, B (Grad): Andy , you actually go by Andy , right ? Oh , OK .
Turn 46, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 47, B (Grad): Eh {disfmarker}
Turn 48, C (Grad): Cuz there is another Andreas around ,
Turn 49, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 50, C (Grad): so , to avoid some confusion .
Turn 51, B (Grad): That will be {pause} Reuter ? Oh , OK .
Turn 52, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 53, B (Grad): So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . And , um , the {disfmarker} um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and {disfmarker} by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using . And um . Was that enough of an update ?
Turn 54, F (Professor): I think so .
Turn 55, B (Grad): In what order shall we proceed ?
Turn 56, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 57, B (Grad): Maybe you have your on - line {disfmarker}
Turn 58, D (Grad): Uh , yeah , sure . Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and {disfmarker} and you know , a time , a route , and then {disfmarker} and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually , you know , a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a {disfmarker} I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use , like , {vocalsound} um , all the user stuff , and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you {disfmarker} you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would {disfmarker} basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff .
Turn 59, F (Professor): Well
Turn 60, D (Grad): Right .
Turn 61, F (Professor): No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is .
Turn 62, D (Grad): The output .
Turn 63, F (Professor): So what decisions does this make ?
Turn 64, D (Grad): OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um , {vocalsound} doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit , I 'll come {disfmarker} well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . So . Anything else I missed ?
Turn 65, F (Professor): So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that uh , probably gives the {disfmarker} the details to anybody who needs them . Um , so the {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .
Turn 66, D (Grad): No , not yet , um {disfmarker}
Turn 67, F (Professor): OK . So one {disfmarker} so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is
Turn 68, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 69, F (Professor): uh , we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if {disfmarker} if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears . Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . Uh , the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's a {disfmarker} a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression . Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know . Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it {disfmarker} if it doesn't .
Turn 70, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 71, F (Professor): You know , it 's the same kind of information . I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , uh , without going to some incredible hacking of {disfmarker} sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . And {disfmarker} you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route .
Turn 72, B (Grad): Um - hmm , um , {vocalsound} well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , Certain {disfmarker} certain beauty in it , so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape . But , the um , as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details . So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it
Turn 73, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 74, B (Grad): and uh {disfmarker} because , um , i Can you go all the way back to the {disfmarker} the very top ?
Turn 75, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 76, B (Grad): Um , {vocalsound} uh these {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} these {disfmarker} w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ?
Turn 77, D (Grad): I can't really see the whole thing .
Turn 78, B (Grad): or are they {disfmarker} have they changed , in a sense ?
Turn 79, D (Grad): Well I think I basically leave them to similar things .
Turn 80, B (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 81, D (Grad): Some of the things might {disfmarker} that might be different , maybe like {disfmarker} are that the hours for the site .
Turn 82, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 83, D (Grad): And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not .
Turn 84, B (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 85, D (Grad): And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} or stuff like that .
Turn 86, B (Grad): And the , uh , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . If {disfmarker}
Turn 87, D (Grad): Which is the structural uncertainty ?
Turn 88, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , I {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} That I think was actually in the previous {disfmarker} the Ubenth stuff . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not ,
Turn 89, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 90, F (Professor): uh , structural uncertainty .
Turn 91, B (Grad): It 's sort of in the definition or {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations ,
Turn 92, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 93, B (Grad): and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations .
Turn 94, F (Professor): Alright .
Turn 95, B (Grad): More uncertainty , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Turn 96, F (Professor): Uh ,
Turn 97, B (Grad): I should say .
Turn 98, D (Grad): I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure ,
Turn 99, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 100, D (Grad): but I don't remember reading how you specify
Turn 101, B (Grad): Yeah , that would be exactly my question .
Turn 102, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 103, D (Grad): wh to start with . Yeah .
Turn 104, B (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 105, D (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 106, F (Professor): Yeah . So , uh , the {disfmarker} the plan is {disfmarker} is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep {disfmarker} seriously connected to {disfmarker} to their work and
Turn 107, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 108, F (Professor): somebody 'll {disfmarker} Uh , you know {disfmarker} If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . So , we 'll actually figure all this out .
Turn 109, B (Grad): OK . OK . Then I think the w {vocalsound} long term perspective is {disfmarker} is pretty clear . We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then this becomes foregrounded
Turn 110, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 111, B (Grad): profiled , focused , again .
Turn 112, E (Grad): Designated ?
Turn 113, A (Grad): Of course .
Turn 114, B (Grad): And um , until then we 'll come up with a something that 's {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} that 's way more complicated for you . Right ?
Turn 115, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 116, B (Grad): Because this was laughingly easy , right ?
Turn 117, D (Grad): Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I {disfmarker} I made it really complicated in the beginning , and Jerry was like , {vocalsound} " this is just too much " .
Turn 118, F (Professor): Yeah . So , um , you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal uh , {vocalsound} uh , thing for {disfmarker}
Turn 119, A (Grad): That 's good . That 's definitely a job for artificial intelligence .
Turn 120, F (Professor): uh , or {disfmarker}
Turn 121, A (Grad): Except for humans can't really solve it either , so .
Turn 122, B (Grad): Well that 's not {disfmarker} not even something humans {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 123, F (Professor): Right . Right . Well that 's the {disfmarker} that would {disfmarker} that would be a {disfmarker} uh , you could sell it , as a {disfmarker}
Turn 124, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 125, F (Professor): OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the {disfmarker}
Turn 126, A (Grad): And then you can blame the computer .
Turn 127, F (Professor): w Exactly .
Turn 128, A (Grad): So .
Turn 129, B (Grad): Hmm . But what does it {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Would a pote potential result be to {disfmarker} to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know .
Turn 130, A (Grad): That should be one of them .
Turn 131, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 132, F (Professor): Yeah . Right .
Turn 133, E (Grad): That 'd be nice .
Turn 134, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 135, F (Professor): Anyway . So . So there i there are some {disfmarker} some u uh , you know , uh , elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . Because we 're gonna see what {disfmarker} what else uh {disfmarker} what else we 're gonna do . Anyway . But uh , it 's good , yeah and {disfmarker} and there were a couple other ideas of {disfmarker} of uh , things for Eva to look at in {disfmarker} in the interim .
Turn 136, B (Grad): Good . Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . Or Andy , for that matter ?
Turn 137, C (Grad): OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a {disfmarker} a little background on {disfmarker} on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the {disfmarker} the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And {disfmarker} and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and {disfmarker} and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and {disfmarker} and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and {disfmarker} and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then {disfmarker} and ask some {disfmarker} some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So um , uh what 's uh {disfmarker} Sort of the state of the art there is to um {disfmarker} uh you have a bunch of {disfmarker} of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh {disfmarker} There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh {disfmarker} with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , I think that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a very {disfmarker} that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh {disfmarker} As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then {disfmarker} But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . Now , what this uh {disfmarker} a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really {disfmarker} Um , so what I 'm {disfmarker} what I try to do is um , to have um , uh {disfmarker} So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what {disfmarker} what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not {disfmarker} it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a {disfmarker} a smart F A Q system . Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than " I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . " So . And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you have the same {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and {disfmarker} and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the {disfmarker} in the context of {disfmarker} in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . Now , um , basically giving this um {disfmarker} Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of {disfmarker} of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some {disfmarker} some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some {disfmarker} some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about {disfmarker} uh , working on {disfmarker} on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used {disfmarker} are written in Java . So some {disfmarker} some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um {disfmarker} off the documents you 're {disfmarker} you 're searching against . So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um {disfmarker} given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh {disfmarker} uh {pause} try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um {disfmarker} steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And {disfmarker} and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which um {disfmarker} which questions are worth um , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and {disfmarker} and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that {disfmarker} that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so , uh what I 'm {disfmarker} What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and {disfmarker} and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . Trying to {disfmarker} to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh {disfmarker} representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . Um . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . That {disfmarker} that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository {disfmarker} depending on which {disfmarker} um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it {disfmarker} it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a {disfmarker} a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's {disfmarker} probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . So these are some of the {disfmarker} just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . And I think a lot of the {disfmarker} even though it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are {disfmarker} are fairly similar . So . OK .
Turn 138, A (Grad): And so some of the {disfmarker} I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I {disfmarker} Are you {disfmarker}
Turn 139, C (Grad): Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it .
Turn 140, A (Grad): So it seems like a lot of {disfmarker} some of the issues are the same . It 's like , um , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret ,
Turn 141, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 142, A (Grad): um , s how to interpret . In {disfmarker} in this case , infer in in knowing {disfmarker} wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse .
Turn 143, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 144, A (Grad): But maybe you guys had that in the previous models .
Turn 145, B (Grad): Well , in a {disfmarker} in one {disfmarker} t one s mmm , small difference in a {disfmarker} in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w
Turn 146, A (Grad): Documents that have the answers .
Turn 147, C (Grad): Yeah , so . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not building an expert {disfmarker}
Turn 148, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 149, C (Grad): Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically
Turn 150, A (Grad): Right . Right .
Turn 151, C (Grad): that can point you to the right reference . I don't wanna compute the answer , so it 's a little bit easier for me .
Turn 152, B (Grad): Well . Uh , you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs {disfmarker}
Turn 153, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 154, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 155, A (Grad): So you also don't have to figure out what the content is . You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , as {disfmarker}
Turn 156, C (Grad): I {disfmarker} I assume that {disfmarker} that the there will be learning systems that {disfmarker} that tag their {disfmarker} their content .
Turn 157, A (Grad): OK . Right .
Turn 158, C (Grad): And um , um , m @ @ and basically what I {disfmarker} what I envision is that you {disfmarker} rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So " this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux " or something like this .
Turn 159, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 160, C (Grad): So . So something {disfmarker} something very specific that you can then {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it {disfmarker} it carries .
Turn 161, A (Grad): Mmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 162, C (Grad): You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because um , uh developing these {disfmarker} these rules and these inference uh {disfmarker} inferences I think is very costly , so um , uh I think you must be able to reuse some {disfmarker} some existing um , domain {disfmarker} domain information , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or ontologies that {disfmarker} that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small uh , content management system .
Turn 163, A (Grad): OK . Mm - hmm .
Turn 164, C (Grad): So I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's crucial for {disfmarker} for the success of {disfmarker} or @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 165, A (Grad): So , you 're not {disfmarker} I guess I 'm trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups ,
Turn 166, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 167, A (Grad): cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and I 'm guessing that you {disfmarker} you won't be doing that ? OK .
Turn 168, C (Grad): No .
Turn 169, A (Grad): Just checking . So , {vocalsound} OK .
Turn 170, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 171, C (Grad): No .
Turn 172, A (Grad): So , you take the query , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 173, F (Professor): On the other hand , uh , FrameNet could well be useful . So do you know the FrameNet story ?
Turn 174, C (Grad): Um , yeah . Uh , not {disfmarker} not too much ,
Turn 175, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 176, C (Grad): but uh ,
Turn 177, F (Professor): Oh . Th - that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here .
Turn 178, C (Grad): I have a rough overview .
Turn 179, F (Professor): Because , um , you know , the standard story is that keyworks {disfmarker} keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords or uh , if you know that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that a {disfmarker} a bunch of keywords uh , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just uh , individual {disfmarker}
Turn 180, C (Grad): Mmm . Mmm .
Turn 181, F (Professor): So there 's a lot of stuff , and people are looking at that . Most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're {disfmarker} they 're busily working away . But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it . And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that .
Turn 182, C (Grad): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , yeah , just how to {disfmarker} how to come up with these structures ,
Turn 183, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 184, C (Grad): cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it maybe then makes sense to {disfmarker} to me , but not to anybody else , and {disfmarker} and if we want to share and integrate things , they must {disfmarker} well , they must be well designed really .
Turn 185, B (Grad): Remember the uh , Prashant story ?
Turn 186, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 187, B (Grad): The absolutely no {disfmarker} no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here .
Turn 188, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 189, B (Grad): And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh {disfmarker} with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine ,
Turn 190, F (Professor): Right . Yeah .
Turn 191, B (Grad): which uh , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation
Turn 192, F (Professor): W yeah , I know , I mean it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} w he did w what {disfmarker} what he did was much more s sensible for him .
Turn 193, B (Grad): which in the {disfmarker} Absolutely . Yeah .
Turn 194, F (Professor): I think uh ,
Turn 195, B (Grad): But so {disfmarker} I 'm just saying , the uh , we had that idea
Turn 196, F (Professor): you know {disfmarker} Yeah . The idea was there . Yeah , OK .
Turn 197, B (Grad): uh to {disfmarker} to exploit FrameNet there as well .
Turn 198, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 199, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 200, B (Grad): And um .
Turn 201, F (Professor): Yeah , actually you guys never {disfmarker}
Turn 202, B (Grad): And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ?
Turn 203, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 204, B (Grad): with that FrameNet base .
Turn 205, C (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 206, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 207, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 208, F (Professor): So you {disfmarker} you guys never sent anybody else from I U .
Turn 209, C (Grad): Except {disfmarker} except Prashant ?
Turn 210, F (Professor): You were y no {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 211, C (Grad): Um ,
Turn 212, F (Professor): Uh , this was supposedly an exchange program , and {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just {disfmarker} I 'm a little surprised that uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .
Turn 213, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 214, C (Grad): Uh I don't know , I mean the uh {disfmarker}
Turn 215, F (Professor): Alright . I mean I had forgotten a I {disfmarker} To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program .
Turn 216, B (Grad): Uh it 's in the program ?
Turn 217, C (Grad): Uh I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's really the lack of students uh , at IU at the moment .
Turn 218, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed . It was {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 219, C (Grad): Yeah , yeah . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of {disfmarker} of students , really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams .
Turn 220, F (Professor): Yeah , I know .
Turn 221, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 222, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 223, C (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 224, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 225, C (Grad): Well I mean if {disfmarker} if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German {vocalsound} {nonvocalsound} company , or {disfmarker}
Turn 226, F (Professor): Yeah . Right .
Turn 227, B (Grad): You are being recorded right now , so beware .
Turn 228, F (Professor): Oh , right !
Turn 229, C (Grad): Well , I didn't say anybody to {disfmarker} anything to offend {disfmarker} well , except for the sponsors maybe , but {disfmarker}
Turn 230, F (Professor): Right . Anyway . Right . So I thi tha that 's {disfmarker} that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here .
Turn 231, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 232, F (Professor): Uh , unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town .
Turn 233, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh , in two weeks .
Turn 234, F (Professor): Right , and {disfmarker} Yeah , for {disfmarker} for some reason he 's not doing that .
Turn 235, A (Grad): Yeah . Well , he had other things to do .
Turn 236, F (Professor): I don't know why he @ @ {disfmarker} oh , I , who knows ?
Turn 237, A (Grad): The uh {disfmarker}
Turn 238, F (Professor): Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see {disfmarker} you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there .
Turn 239, A (Grad): The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic spotting
Turn 240, F (Professor): Yeah . St - statistical stuff . That would be a very good idea .
Turn 241, A (Grad): w um , which is , I mean , you {disfmarker} I mean . I don't {disfmarker} Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end ,
Turn 242, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 243, A (Grad): you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on {disfmarker} has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once .
Turn 244, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 245, A (Grad): So . And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . So . I u {vocalsound} Dan Gildea , GILDEA .
Turn 246, C (Grad): So , uh , who is that again ?
Turn 247, A (Grad): And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff ,
Turn 248, B (Grad): Who ? I can take you to his office .
Turn 249, A (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 250, B (Grad): It 's just around the corner .
Turn 251, C (Grad): OK , great .
Turn 252, A (Grad): Hmm . Well , if you fal solve the problem , {vocalsound} hope you can do one for us too .
Turn 253, F (Professor): Alright , was there anything else for this ? One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal .
Turn 254, B (Grad): Yeah . I 'm sure . I have um {disfmarker} I think it was November two thousand three or some {disfmarker} No . Wh - I had something in my calendar .
Turn 255, F (Professor): Oh , OK . Right .
Turn 256, B (Grad): Um ,
Turn 257, E (Grad): Wait a second . That 's a long way away .
Turn 258, F (Professor): Good thinking !
Turn 259, B (Grad): Uh well , maybe I can {disfmarker} I can bribe my way out of this . So . So I did some double checking and it seems like spring break in two thousand {vocalsound} one .
Turn 260, A (Grad): Talk about changing the topic .
Turn 261, B (Grad): No .
Turn 262, F (Professor): Well , no , but he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes .
Turn 263, A (Grad): At least this is a private meeting . Right , exactly , OK , that 's the link .
Turn 264, B (Grad): This uh {disfmarker} Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it {disfmarker} so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing .
Turn 265, F (Professor): Uh , this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} t the s we 're , uh , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh , program . Uh , with the State of California . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . So the budget has not been approved . And two days ago {disfmarker} There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it ,
Turn 266, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 267, F (Professor): and , um , yesterdayday {comment} there was this uh {disfmarker} uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who {disfmarker} who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So , um {disfmarker} Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . So , I {disfmarker} it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil . KILL {disfmarker} KALIL . And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they {disfmarker} So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , uh , they think the money 's coming . So {disfmarker} and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , " for example " , this was his only example , " if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact " . I said , " Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . " Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it .
Turn 268, A (Grad): Mmm . Definitely .
Turn 269, F (Professor): So that 's {disfmarker} So anyway , that 's the end of the story .
Turn 270, A (Grad): But for adults and not for the children .
Turn 271, F (Professor): This was {disfmarker} Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,
Turn 272, A (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 273, F (Professor): but , uh , you know , a again , if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you
Turn 274, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 275, F (Professor): um , and this was {disfmarker} this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem .
Turn 276, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 277, F (Professor): Maybe easier . I don't know . So this is reading , rather than teaching {disfmarker} Another project we started on , and {disfmarker} and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . Which is like half the school population in California . Something like that ,
Turn 278, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 279, F (Professor): isn't it ? Yeah . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build {vocalsound} uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . We think we could . Anyway . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} But this is a slightly different problem ,
Turn 280, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 281, F (Professor): and um , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's {disfmarker} it 's interesting and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So anyway , that was {disfmarker} that was today 's little story .
Turn 282, E (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 283, B (Grad): OK . So I {disfmarker} I did manage to get {disfmarker} pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS ,
Turn 284, F (Professor): No , no .
Turn 285, B (Grad): but uh or {disfmarker} a temporarily putting it out of the sling
Turn 286, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 287, B (Grad): but , I {disfmarker} I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,
Turn 288, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 289, B (Grad): and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal . And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I {disfmarker} I can potentially present once you get back .
Turn 290, A (Grad): Greater than two ?
Turn 291, F (Professor): You 're good .
Turn 292, B (Grad): Nnn . {comment} s sometimes , you know the sum is not uh less than the {disfmarker}
Turn 293, A (Grad): Uh , right , right .
Turn 294, F (Professor): Right . Right . Anyway . Yeah , so {disfmarker} OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's time again , right ?
Turn 295, B (Grad): Absolutely . Yeah .
Turn 296, F (Professor): Yeah . OK .
Turn 297, B (Grad): But um , and hopefully all sidetracking um , other things will have disappeared , soon .
Turn 298, F (Professor): Good . Yep . Done ?
