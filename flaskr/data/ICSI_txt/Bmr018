Turn 0, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1, G (Grad): How about channel
Turn 2, C (Professor): Yeah , go ahead .
Turn 3, E (Grad): We 're recording .
Turn 4, G (Grad): Alright .
Turn 5, C (Professor): Alright , and no crash .
Turn 6, A (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 7, E (Grad): I pre - crashed it .
Turn 8, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 9, F (PhD): Pre - crashed !
Turn 10, D (PhD): It never crashes on me .
Turn 11, E (Grad): I think it 's actually {disfmarker}
Turn 12, D (PhD): What is {disfmarker} what is that ?
Turn 13, E (Grad): it depends on if the temp files are there or not , that {disfmarker} at least that 's my current working hypothesis ,
Turn 14, D (PhD): Ah .
Turn 15, E (Grad): that I think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they 're too big , it crashes .
Turn 16, D (PhD): Ah .
Turn 17, B (PhD): When the power went out the other day and I restarted it , it crashed the first time .
Turn 18, E (Grad): Oh , that 's right .
Turn 19, B (PhD): After the power out
Turn 20, D (PhD): So then there would be no temp files .
Turn 21, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 22, D (PhD): OK . {comment} Hmm .
Turn 23, E (Grad): Uh , no , it doesn't {disfmarker} it doesn't clear those necessarily ,
Turn 24, D (PhD): Oh wait {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it doesn't clear them , OK .
Turn 25, E (Grad): so .
Turn 26, C (Professor): Hmm , no connection .
Turn 27, E (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} i they 're called temp files , but they 're not actually in the temp directory they 're in the scratch , so . They 're not backed up , but they 're not erased either on power failure .
Turn 28, D (PhD): But that 's usually the meeting that I recorded , and it neve it doesn't crash on me .
Turn 29, B (PhD): Well this wasn't {disfmarker} Actually , this wasn't a before your meeting , this was , um , Tuesday afternoon when , um , uh , Robert just wanted to do a little recording ,
Turn 30, E (Grad): Oh well .
Turn 31, D (PhD): Oh {disfmarker} Oh , right .
Turn 32, B (PhD): and the power had gone out earlier in the day .
Turn 33, D (PhD): OK . Huh , OK .
Turn 34, C (Professor): I don't know when would be a good excuse for it , but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and use the example from last week with everybody t doing the digits at once .
Turn 35, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 36, A (Postdoc): That was fun .
Turn 37, C (Professor): I 'd love to play somebody that .
Turn 38, A (Postdoc): That was fun .
Turn 39, D (PhD): It was quick .
Turn 40, C (Professor): It was . It was really efficient .
Turn 41, B (PhD): Talk about a good noise shield . You know ? You wanted to pe keep people from listening in , you could like have that playing outside the room . Nobody could listen in .
Turn 42, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 43, D (PhD): Well , I had this idea we could make our whole meeting faster that way .
Turn 44, C (Professor): Yeah . Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time ,
Turn 45, D (PhD): And we 'll just all leave ,
Turn 46, B (PhD): And then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go back later and review the individual channels ,
Turn 47, C (Professor): yeah .
Turn 48, D (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 49, E (Grad): Yep , and then everyone can listen to it later .
Turn 50, B (PhD): right ?
Turn 51, E (Grad): Yes . Absolutely .
Turn 52, B (PhD): If you wanna know what {disfmarker}
Turn 53, C (Professor): Actually isn't that what we have been doing ?
Turn 54, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 55, E (Grad): It 's what it sounds like .
Turn 56, B (PhD): Practically , huh . With all the overlaps .
Turn 57, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 58, C (Professor): What are we doing ?
Turn 59, E (Grad): I {disfmarker} Since I 've been gone all week , I didn't send out a reminder for an agenda , so .
Turn 60, C (Professor): Yeah , and I 'm just {disfmarker}
Turn 61, E (Grad): Do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go ?
Turn 62, B (PhD): I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was .
Turn 63, C (Professor): What conference ?
Turn 64, D (PhD): Uh , I had one question about {disfmarker}
Turn 65, E (Grad): Yeah , really . It 's all a blur .
Turn 66, D (PhD): Aren't the UW folks coming this weekend ?
Turn 67, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 68, F (PhD): No . The next ,
Turn 69, D (PhD): Next weekend ?
Turn 70, E (Grad): Next weekend , week from {disfmarker}
Turn 71, F (PhD): right ?
Turn 72, C (Professor): That is right . The next weekend .
Turn 73, D (PhD): Sorry , not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not the days coming up , but {disfmarker}
Turn 74, F (PhD): It 's like the {disfmarker}
Turn 75, E (Grad): A week from Saturday .
Turn 76, D (PhD): Yeah ,
Turn 77, C (Professor): That 's when they 're coming .
Turn 78, D (PhD): within ten days .
Turn 79, C (Professor): That 's correct .
Turn 80, D (PhD): So , are we {disfmarker} do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be {disfmarker}
Turn 81, C (Professor): No , but that would be a good idea .
Turn 82, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 83, C (Professor): Why don't we w
Turn 84, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} so the deal is that I can , um , {vocalsound} uh , I can be available after , uh , like ten thirty or something . I don't know how s how early you wanted to {disfmarker}
Turn 85, C (Professor): They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so .
Turn 86, E (Grad): That 's good .
Turn 87, F (PhD): Oh , OK . So {disfmarker}
Turn 88, C (Professor): Cuz they 're flying up that day .
Turn 89, D (PhD): Wait , this is on {disfmarker} on Sunday ?
Turn 90, C (Professor): Saturday .
Turn 91, D (PhD): Or Saturday ?
Turn 92, C (Professor): Saturday .
Turn 93, F (PhD): Saturday .
Turn 94, C (Professor): S Saturday .
Turn 95, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 96, E (Grad): Well , y
Turn 97, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 98, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 99, E (Grad): Eurospeech is due on Friday and then I 'm going down to San {disfmarker} uh , San Jose Friday night , so , if {disfmarker} you know , if we start nice and late Saturday that 's a good thing .
Turn 100, C (Professor): No , I mean , they 're flying up from {disfmarker} from {disfmarker}
Turn 101, E (Grad): Seattle .
Turn 102, C (Professor): down from Seattle .
Turn 103, E (Grad): They 're flying from somewhere to somewhere ,
Turn 104, C (Professor): Yeah , and they 'll end up here . So b and also Brian Kingsbury is actually flying from , uh , the east coast on that {disfmarker} that morning .
Turn 105, A (Postdoc): Excellent .
Turn 106, C (Professor): So , i I {disfmarker} I will be {disfmarker} I mean , he 's taking a very early flight
Turn 107, F (PhD): Oh .
Turn 108, C (Professor): and we do have the time work difference running the right way , but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven . It might end up really being twelve . So when we get closer we 'll find people 's plane schedules , and let everybody know . Uh , So . That 's good .
Turn 109, E (Grad): But , uh , yeah maybe an agenda , or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea .
Turn 110, C (Professor): Well we can start gathering those {disfmarker} those ideas , but then we {disfmarker} we should firm it up by next {disfmarker} next Thursday 's meeting .
Turn 111, A (Postdoc): Will we have time to , um , to prepare something that we {disfmarker} in the format we were planning for the IBM transcribers by then , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 112, E (Grad): Oh yeah . Absolutely .
Turn 113, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 114, E (Grad): So have you heard back from Brian about that , Chuck ?
Turn 115, B (PhD): Yes , um , he 's {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along . Uh , {vocalsound} oh I {disfmarker} I think I mentioned at the last meeting , he said that , um , he talked to them and it was fine {disfmarker} with the beeps they would be {disfmarker} That 's easy for them to do .
Turn 116, E (Grad): Great . OK . So , uh , oh , though Thi - Thilo isn't here , um , but , uh , I {disfmarker} I have the program to insert the beeps . What I don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps , but that should be really easy to do . So do we have a meeting that that 's been done with ,
Turn 117, A (Postdoc): He 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker}
Turn 118, E (Grad): that we 've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out ?
Turn 119, A (Postdoc): He generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting , but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ?
Turn 120, B (PhD): Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything .
Turn 121, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 122, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 123, B (PhD): This experiment of just {disfmarker}
Turn 124, E (Grad): Well we had {disfmarker} we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good choice , though . Well , {vocalsound} whatever we have .
Turn 125, B (PhD): Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe .
Turn 126, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 127, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 128, B (PhD): But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to {disfmarker} f
Turn 129, E (Grad): Yeah , maybe it doesn't matter .
Turn 130, A (Postdoc): Great .
Turn 131, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} I don't think it matte
Turn 132, A (Postdoc): I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , um , get {disfmarker} make that available .
Turn 133, E (Grad): OK , and has it been corrected ?
Turn 134, A (Postdoc): Oh , well , wait . Um {disfmarker}
Turn 135, E (Grad): Hand - checked ? Cuz that was one of the {vocalsound} processes we were talking about as well .
Turn 136, B (PhD): Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it ,
Turn 137, A (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 138, B (PhD): and then we go in and adjust the boundaries .
Turn 139, A (Postdoc): Yeah that 's right . Yeah , we haven't done that . I {disfmarker} I could set someone on that tomorrow .
Turn 140, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 141, E (Grad): And time how long it takes .
Turn 142, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 143, A (Postdoc): I think they 're coming {disfmarker}
Turn 144, B (PhD): And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try .
Turn 145, A (Postdoc): OK . What would be a good number of minutes ?
Turn 146, B (PhD): I don't know , maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to {disfmarker} to do .
Turn 147, E (Grad): Um , I don't know , it seems to me w we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting because we 'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime .
Turn 148, C (Professor): Yes except that if they had {disfmarker} if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them {disfmarker} It 's just dependent of how much {disfmarker}
Turn 149, E (Grad): Like I {disfmarker} I mean I guess if we have to do it again anyway , but , uh
Turn 150, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 151, B (PhD): I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um , how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ,
Turn 152, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 153, B (PhD): and {disfmarker} I mean , is it pretty easy ?
Turn 154, E (Grad): I think it 's gonna be one or two times real time at {disfmarker} Wow , excuse me , two or more times real time , right ? Cuz they have to at least listen to it .
Turn 155, C (Professor): Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we {disfmarker} you run it through this other {disfmarker} other stuff ? Uh ,
Turn 156, E (Grad): Well the other stuff is I B I 'm just thinking that from a data {disfmarker} keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces .
Turn 157, C (Professor): OK , so . Oh , that 's right . So the first thing is the automatic thing , and then it 's {disfmarker} then it 's {disfmarker} then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up ,
Turn 158, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 159, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 160, C (Professor): and then it 's IBM .
Turn 161, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 162, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 163, C (Professor): OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting , and then {disfmarker} and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed .
Turn 164, A (Postdoc): And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ?
Turn 165, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 166, C (Professor): Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end , right ? So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM .
Turn 167, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 168, C (Professor): Right ?
Turn 169, B (PhD): As of what point ? I mean . The {disfmarker} I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM , or do we go ahead and send them a sample ? Let their {disfmarker}
Turn 170, C (Professor): Why wouldn't we s @ @ w i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them {disfmarker} I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?
Turn 171, B (PhD): Well I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know .
Turn 172, E (Grad): That was the question . Though .
Turn 173, C (Professor): So if we {disfmarker} if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .
Turn 174, B (PhD): Yeah . Uh . That {disfmarker} I agree . I agree .
Turn 175, E (Grad): Well , I don't think {disfmarker} I mean , h they {disfmarker} they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ?
Turn 176, A (Postdoc): Hmm , I gue hmm .
Turn 177, E (Grad): I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting . I would think , unless it 's a lot harder than we think it is , which it could be , certainly .
Turn 178, A (Postdoc): If it 's got like for speakers then I guess {disfmarker} I mean if {disfmarker}
Turn 179, B (PhD): We 're just doing the individual channels ,
Turn 180, E (Grad): Or seven or eight .
Turn 181, B (PhD): right ?
Turn 182, A (Postdoc): Individual channels . Yeah .
Turn 183, B (PhD): So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting , um ,
Turn 184, A (Postdoc): I guess there is this issue of , you know , if {disfmarker} if the segmenter thought there was no speech on {disfmarker} on a particular stretch , on a particular channel ,
Turn 185, E (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 186, A (Postdoc): and there really was , then , if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked , so , I mean , the question is " should {disfmarker} should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? " And I th eh so far as I 'm concerned it 's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point , and {disfmarker}
Turn 187, E (Grad): That 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to .
Turn 188, A (Postdoc): And that cuts down the time . Yeah .
Turn 189, E (Grad): But they don't have to for most of it .
Turn 190, A (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's good . So . Yeah . Good , good , good .
Turn 191, B (PhD): I don't see how that will work , though .
Turn 192, A (Postdoc): What {disfmarker} what aspect ?
Turn 193, C (Professor): So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ?
Turn 194, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 195, C (Professor): So how do you {disfmarker}
Turn 196, E (Grad): So , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line ,
Turn 197, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 198, E (Grad): but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries , correcting the boundaries . You shouldn't have to tighten them too much because Thilo 's program does that .
Turn 199, A (Postdoc): Should be pretty good , yeah .
Turn 200, D (PhD): Except for {vocalsound} it doesn't do well on short things , remember .
Turn 201, E (Grad): Right , so {disfmarker} so you 'll have to I {disfmarker}
Turn 202, D (PhD): It will miss them . It will miss most of the really short things .
Turn 203, E (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 204, D (PhD): Like that .
Turn 205, A (Postdoc): But those would be {disfmarker} those would be {disfmarker}
Turn 206, D (PhD): Uh - huh . It will {disfmarker} it will miss {disfmarker}
Turn 207, E (Grad): Uh - huh !
Turn 208, D (PhD): Yeah , you have to say " uh - huh " more slowly to {disfmarker} to get c
Turn 209, E (Grad): Sorry .
Turn 210, D (PhD): No , I 'm s I 'm actually serious .
Turn 211, E (Grad): I 'll work on that .
Turn 212, D (PhD): So it will miss stuff like that which {disfmarker}
Turn 213, B (PhD): I {disfmarker}
Turn 214, E (Grad): Well , so {disfmarker} so that 's something that the transcribers will have to {disfmarker} have to do .
Turn 215, A (Postdoc): Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section when {disfmarker} in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway .
Turn 216, B (PhD): That 's {disfmarker} that 's what I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm concerned about the part .
Turn 217, D (PhD): Right , and that 's what I 'm not sure about .
Turn 218, A (Postdoc): Yeah , I am too . And I think it 's an empirical question .
Turn 219, B (PhD): Can't we {disfmarker} uh couldn't we just have , um , I don't know , maybe this just doesn't fit with the software , but I guess if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries , I would just show them one channel at a time , with the marks , and let them adju
Turn 220, A (Postdoc): Oh they can {disfmarker}
Turn 221, E (Grad): Well , but then they have to do {disfmarker} but then they {disfmarker} for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that .
Turn 222, A (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's it . Yeah .
Turn 223, E (Grad): Right ? Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through .
Turn 224, A (Postdoc): And if {disfmarker}
Turn 225, B (PhD): But i but it 's very quick ,
Turn 226, A (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 227, B (PhD): right ? I mean , you scan {disfmarker} I mean , if you have a display of the waveform .
Turn 228, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 229, E (Grad): Oh , you 're talking about visually .
Turn 230, A (Postdoc): w Well , the other problem is the breaths
Turn 231, E (Grad): I just don't think {disfmarker}
Turn 232, A (Postdoc): cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform . I 've {disfmarker} I 've looked at the int uh , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel , and {disfmarker} and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice .
Turn 233, B (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 234, E (Grad): Yeah , and I {disfmarker} I think that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .
Turn 235, A (Postdoc): Well that {disfmarker} that I 'm not sure .
Turn 236, E (Grad): So .
Turn 237, A (Postdoc): What you {disfmarker} the digital {disfmarker} what the digital task that you had your interface ? Um , I know for a fact that one of those {disfmarker} sh she could really well {disfmarker} she could judge what th what the number was based on the {disfmarker} on the waveform .
Turn 238, E (Grad): Yeah , that 's actually true . Yeah , you 're right . You 're absolutely right . Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form {vocalsound} I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes .
Turn 239, A (Postdoc): Yeah , she could tell which one was seven .
Turn 240, E (Grad): Um , maybe .
Turn 241, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 242, C (Professor): So I don't {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm now entirely confused about what they do .
Turn 243, E (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 244, C (Professor): So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're looking at a mixed signal , or they 're looking {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what are they looking at visually ?
Turn 245, A (Postdoc): Well , they have a choice . They could choose any signal to look at . I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed . But I 've {disfmarker} I 've tried looking at the single signal and {disfmarker} and in order to judge when it {disfmarker} when it was speech and when it wasn't ,
Turn 246, E (Grad): Oh .
Turn 247, A (Postdoc): but the problem is then you have breaths which {disfmarker} which show up on the signal .
Turn 248, C (Professor): But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them ,
Turn 249, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 250, F (PhD): 
Turn 251, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 252, C (Professor): and they have multiple , uh , well , let 's see , there isn't {disfmarker} we don't have transcription yet . So {disfmarker} but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically ,
Turn 253, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 254, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 255, C (Professor): and those show up on the mixed signal ?
Turn 256, A (Postdoc): Oh ,
Turn 257, C (Professor): There 's a @ @ clicks ?
Turn 258, E (Grad): N the t
Turn 259, A (Postdoc): they show up on the separate ribbons . So you have a separate ribbon for each channel ,
Turn 260, C (Professor): There 're separate ribbons .
Turn 261, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 262, A (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and i i it 'll be {disfmarker} because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his {disfmarker} with Thilo 's new procedure , then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins {disfmarker} uh across the ribbons uh you could have {disfmarker}
Turn 263, C (Professor): And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ?
Turn 264, E (Grad): Yes .
Turn 265, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 266, C (Professor): OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it , and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then {disfmarker} and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide ,
Turn 267, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 268, E (Grad): Right . Right .
Turn 269, C (Professor): and if it {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form .
Turn 270, A (Postdoc): Oh , well not {disfmarker} not " look " .
Turn 271, E (Grad): Right . Well , they wouldn't look at it {pause} at this point . They would just listen .
Turn 272, C (Professor): They {disfmarker} they might look at it , right ?
Turn 273, E (Grad): Well , the problem is that the {disfmarker} the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .
Turn 274, A (Postdoc): Not very quickly .
Turn 275, E (Grad): The problem is that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms .
Turn 276, A (Postdoc): You can but it takes time . That 's it .
Turn 277, C (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 278, E (Grad): And so when I tried {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that was the first thing I tried when I first started it ,
Turn 279, A (Postdoc): Oh , oh . Visually . You can {disfmarker} you can switch quickly between the audio ,
Turn 280, E (Grad): right ?
Turn 281, A (Postdoc): but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly . So you have to {disfmarker} It takes , I don't know , three , four minutes to {disfmarker} Well , I mean , it takes {disfmarker} it takes long enough {disfmarker}
Turn 282, D (PhD): Yeah , it 's very slow to do that .
Turn 283, A (Postdoc): It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the I {disfmarker} I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly cuz {disfmarker} but it t it takes long enough that it 's just not a practical alternative .
Turn 284, D (PhD): That w
Turn 285, E (Grad): Well it {disfmarker} it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly ,
Turn 286, G (Grad): But you can cancel that .
Turn 287, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 288, E (Grad): yeah . But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly .
Turn 289, G (Grad): Oh , really ?
Turn 290, A (Postdoc): Now you could set up multiple windows , each one with a different signal showing , and then look between the windows .
Turn 291, E (Grad): So .
Turn 292, G (Grad): Huh !
Turn 293, A (Postdoc): Maybe that 's the solution .
Turn 294, E (Grad): I mean , we {disfmarker} we could do different interfaces ,
Turn 295, G (Grad): What if you preload them all ?
Turn 296, E (Grad): right ? I mean , so {disfmarker} so we could use like X Waves instead of Transcriber ,
Turn 297, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 298, E (Grad): and it loads faster , certainly .
Turn 299, G (Grad): What if you were to preload all the channels or {disfmarker} or initially {disfmarker}
Turn 300, E (Grad): Well that 's what I tried originally .
Turn 301, G (Grad): like doesn't {disfmarker}
Turn 302, E (Grad): So I {disfmarker} I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform ,
Turn 303, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 304, E (Grad): but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll . So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go " kur - chunk ! "
Turn 305, G (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 306, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 307, E (Grad): And so it just was not doable with the current interface .
Turn 308, A (Postdoc): You know , I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and , you know , you could fire up a Transcriber interface for , y you know , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel . And it 's sort of a {disfmarker} a hack but I mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form .
Turn 309, E (Grad): I think that if we decide that we need {disfmarker} that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .
Turn 310, A (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 311, C (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 312, D (PhD): That 's actually what I thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , I mean , you know , that {disfmarker} that would make it faster {disfmarker}
Turn 313, E (Grad): An But isn't {disfmarker}
Turn 314, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 315, E (Grad): The chopped up waveforms .
Turn 316, B (PhD): The problem is if {disfmarker} if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up {disfmarker}
Turn 317, D (PhD): So .
Turn 318, E (Grad): Isn't that {disfmarker}
Turn 319, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 320, D (PhD): Right , but if you a at some point {disfmarker}
Turn 321, E (Grad): And wouldn't that be the same {comment} as the mixed signal ?
Turn 322, D (PhD): No , I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that {disfmarker} it 'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments .
Turn 323, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 324, D (PhD): Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out , but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location ,
Turn 325, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 326, D (PhD): and ,
Turn 327, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 328, D (PhD): um , might be nice , cuz we save those out already , {comment} um , to be able to do that . But it won't work for IBM of course , it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels .
Turn 329, A (Postdoc): Well , I {disfmarker} I do think that this {disfmarker} this will be a doable procedure ,
Turn 330, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 331, A (Postdoc): and have them starting with mixed
Turn 332, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 333, A (Postdoc): and , um , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from {disfmarker} from audio view .
Turn 334, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , hopefully , I mean {disfmarker} The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized . So I think they should be able to hear . The only problem is {disfmarker} is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not . So , I don't know .
Turn 335, D (PhD): I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,
Turn 336, E (Grad): Right but {disfmarker} but once {disfmarker} once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking ,
Turn 337, D (PhD): but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch . Right . And then you would switch into the other {disfmarker}
Turn 338, E (Grad): so .
Turn 339, C (Professor): But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying .
Turn 340, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 341, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 342, C (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 343, E (Grad): Right , so {disfmarker} so
Turn 344, C (Professor): so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway .
Turn 345, E (Grad): did Dave {disfmarker} Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?
Turn 346, A (Postdoc): Yes . Yes .
Turn 347, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 348, A (Postdoc): Click {disfmarker} Um ,
Turn 349, E (Grad): I had suggested it before . I just don't know whether he did it or not .
Turn 350, A (Postdoc): I 'm not sure what {disfmarker} click what {disfmarker} click on the ribbon ? Yeah , you can get that {disfmarker}
Turn 351, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 352, A (Postdoc): oh , oh , get {disfmarker} you can get the , uh {disfmarker} you can get it to switch audio ? Uh , not last I tried ,
Turn 353, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 354, A (Postdoc): but , um , maybe he 's changed it again .
Turn 355, E (Grad): We should get him to do that because , uh , I think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu .
Turn 356, A (Postdoc): I disagree . There 's a reason I disagree , and that is that , uh , you {disfmarker} it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio . There 're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal , bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel . So right now {disfmarker}
Turn 357, E (Grad): Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it .
Turn 358, A (Postdoc): Maybe , I just don't {disfmarker} I don't see that it 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 359, E (Grad): Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster .
Turn 360, A (Postdoc): Well , I mean , that 's the i I {disfmarker} I think that might be a personal style thing . I find it really convenient the way {disfmarker} the way it 's set up right now .
Turn 361, E (Grad): Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly {disfmarker} " well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan " , right now , you have to go up to the menu , and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below , and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below .
Turn 362, A (Postdoc): That 's fine . Yeah , it 's true .
Turn 363, E (Grad): So you can definitely streamline that with the i with the interface .
Turn 364, A (Postdoc): Yeah , it could be faster , but , you know , I mean , th in the ideal world {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 365, E (Grad): What ?
Turn 366, A (Postdoc): No I {disfmarker} I agree that 'd be nice . Yeah . OK .
Turn 367, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 368, C (Professor): So , um , Done with that ?  Does any {disfmarker} I forget , does anybody , uh , working on any {disfmarker} any Eurospeech submission related to this ?
Turn 369, E (Grad): I would like to try to do something on digits but I just don't know if we have time . I mean , it 's due next Friday so we have to do the experiments and write the paper . So , I 'm gonna try , but , uh , we 'll just have to see . So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and , uh , uh , Stephane with their respective systems .
Turn 370, C (Professor): Yeah . Yeah there was that {disfmarker} we that 's right , we had that one conversation about , uh , what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological , was it a {disfmarker}
Turn 371, E (Grad): Right , and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen .
Turn 372, F (PhD): Oh , I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't listened to them either ,
Turn 373, E (Grad): I was going to do that this afternoon .
Turn 374, F (PhD): but there must be something wrong , I mean ,
Turn 375, E (Grad): Well , Morgan and I were {disfmarker} were having a debate {comment} about that .
Turn 376, F (PhD): unless our {disfmarker}
Turn 377, E (Grad): Whereas I think it it 's probably something pathologic and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that . He s he did the Aurora system also got very lousy average error , like fifteen or {disfmarker} or , uh , fifteen to twenty percent average ? But then he ran it just on the lapel , and got about five or six percent word error ? So that {disfmarker} that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases . But , you know , we {disfmarker} th that may not be true . It may be just some of the segments they 're just doing a lousy job on . So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll listen to it and find out since you 'd actually split it up by segment .
Turn 378, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 379, E (Grad): So I can actually listen to it .
Turn 380, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 381, B (PhD): Did you run the {disfmarker} Andreas {disfmarker} the r SRI recognizer on the digits ?
Turn 382, E (Grad): Oh , I thought he had sent that around to everyone ,
Turn 383, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 384, E (Grad): did you just sent that to me ?
Turn 385, F (PhD): No , I d I didn't .
Turn 386, E (Grad): Oh .
Turn 387, F (PhD): Since I considered those preliminary , I didn't .
Turn 388, B (PhD): I it wasn't {disfmarker}
Turn 389, F (PhD): But , yeah , if you take {disfmarker}
Turn 390, E (Grad): It was bimodal .
Turn 391, F (PhD): So if you {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's actually , um , it {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} it was trimodal , actually {disfmarker}
Turn 392, E (Grad): Oh , was it trimodal , OK .
Turn 393, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 394, F (PhD): trimodal , so
Turn 395, C (Professor): There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot .
Turn 396, F (PhD): there were {disfmarker} {vocalsound} t there was {disfmarker} there was one h one bump at ze around zero , which were the native speakers ,
Turn 397, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 398, B (PhD): Zero percent error ?
Turn 399, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 400, F (PhD): the non - pathological native speakers .
Turn 401, C (Professor): Y yeah .
Turn 402, F (PhD): Then there was another bump at , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} oh , like fifteen or something .
Turn 403, B (PhD): This is error you 're talking about ?
Turn 404, C (Professor): Oh was it fifteen ?
Turn 405, F (PhD): whe
Turn 406, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 407, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 408, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 409, F (PhD): Yeah . Those were the non - natives . And then there was another distinct bump at , like , a hundred , {vocalsound} which must have been some problem .
Turn 410, A (Postdoc): Oh , wow ! Oh , OK .
Turn 411, F (PhD): I can't imagine that {disfmarker}
Turn 412, G (Grad): What is patho what do you mean by pathological ?
Turn 413, E (Grad): Just {disfmarker} just something really wrong with {disfmarker}
Turn 414, G (Grad): I 'm sorry , I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 415, E (Grad): A bug is what I mean ,
Turn 416, F (PhD): In the recording
Turn 417, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 418, E (Grad): so that it 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 419, G (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 420, F (PhD): And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , uh , six out of the eight channels were all , like {disfmarker} had a hundred percent error .
Turn 421, G (Grad): I see .
Turn 422, E (Grad): Which probably means like there was a {disfmarker} th the recording interface crashed ,
Turn 423, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 424, E (Grad): or there was a short {disfmarker} you know , someone was jiggling with a cord
Turn 425, F (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 426, E (Grad): or , uh , I extracted it incorrectly ,
Turn 427, F (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 428, E (Grad): it was labeled {disfmarker}
Turn 429, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 430, E (Grad): it was transcribed incorrectly , something really bad happened , and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was .
Turn 431, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 432, F (PhD): So , if I excluded the pathological ones , {vocalsound} by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , {vocalsound} and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something ,
Turn 433, C (Professor): What we 're calling .
Turn 434, A (Postdoc): Oh . Oh .
Turn 435, F (PhD): which {disfmarker} which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for it .
Turn 436, G (Grad): Hmm !
Turn 437, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 438, F (PhD): And the grammar wasn't tuned either .
Turn 439, B (PhD): And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the {disfmarker}
Turn 440, F (PhD): It was just a @ @ . I haven't split it up that way ,
Turn 441, D (PhD): But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter .
Turn 442, F (PhD): but it would be {disfmarker}
Turn 443, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 444, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 445, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 446, C (Professor): No , but there 's a little difference ,
Turn 447, F (PhD): So it should {disfmarker}
Turn 448, E (Grad): There 's a lot .
Turn 449, C (Professor): and we haven't looked at it for digits ,
Turn 450, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 451, C (Professor): right ?
Turn 452, B (PhD): Yeah , so I was curious about that .
Turn 453, C (Professor): And so , cuz {disfmarker} because what he was {disfmarker} what I was saying when I looked at those things is it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because {vocalsound} {disfmarker} because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent .
Turn 454, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 455, C (Professor): They just plain got it all right . And then there {disfmarker} and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something .
Turn 456, F (PhD): Yeah . But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and {disfmarker} it was a nice {disfmarker} uh , you know , it {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} zero was the most of them ,
Turn 457, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 458, E (Grad): A normal . Yeah .
Turn 459, F (PhD): but then there were {disfmarker} the others were sort of decaying from there .
Turn 460, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 461, F (PhD): And then there was the bump for the non - natives and then the pathological ones ,
Turn 462, C (Professor): I see . I see .
Turn 463, F (PhD): so .
Turn 464, E (Grad): Yeah , cuz some of our non - natives are pretty non - native . So .
Turn 465, A (Postdoc): You {disfmarker} did you have , uh , something in the report about , uh , {disfmarker} about , uh , for f uh , forced alignment ?
Turn 466, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 467, A (Postdoc): Have you {disfmarker} have you started on that ?
Turn 468, F (PhD): Oh , well , yeah , so I 've been struggling with the forced alignments . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the scheme that I drew on the board last time where we tried to , um {vocalsound} allow reject models for the s speech from other speakers , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} most of the time it doesn't work very well . So , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} I haven't done {disfmarker} I mean , the only way to check this right now was for me to actually {vocalsound} load these into X Waves and , you know , plus the alignments , and s play them and see where the {disfmarker}
Turn 469, C (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 470, F (PhD): And it looks {disfmarker} And so I looked at all of the utterances from you , Chuck , in that one conversation , I don't know which {disfmarker} You probably know which one I mean , it 's where you were on the lapel {vocalsound} and Morgan was sitting next to you and we can hear everything Morgan says .
Turn 471, A (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 472, F (PhD): But {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and some of what you {disfmarker} I mean , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk . So , {vocalsound} I actually went through all of those , there were I think fifty - five segments , {vocalsound} um , in {disfmarker} in X Waves , and {disfmarker} and sort of did a crude check , and {vocalsound} more often than not , it {disfmarker} it gets it wrong . So there 's either the beginning , mostly the beginning word , {vocalsound} where th you , um , you know , Chuck talks somewhere into the segment , but the first , um , word of what he says , often " I " but it 's very reduced " I , " that 's just aligned {vocalsound} to the beginning of someone else 's speech , uh in that segment , which is cross - talk . So , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} I 'm still tinkering with it , but it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this {disfmarker} out of those , uh , {vocalsound} channels , so .
Turn 473, C (Professor): Unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business .
Turn 474, D (PhD): Right , but that 's {disfmarker} I mean , that was our plan ,
Turn 475, F (PhD): Yeah , right .
Turn 476, D (PhD): but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time .
Turn 477, C (Professor): Oh , the short amount of time thing , right .
Turn 478, D (PhD): So {disfmarker} so we {disfmarker} you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the HLT paper and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis ,
Turn 479, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 480, D (PhD): but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap . It 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap , it 's just whether or not the , um , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere .
Turn 481, E (Grad): c High correlation .
Turn 482, D (PhD): And , you know , that pointed out some differences , so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward . If it were straight - forward then we would try it , but {disfmarker} so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time , but , um {disfmarker}
Turn 483, B (PhD): I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward .
Turn 484, E (Grad): Well if we 'd just {disfmarker}
Turn 485, C (Professor): Well
Turn 486, B (PhD): I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it .
Turn 487, E (Grad): Um - hmm .
Turn 488, D (PhD): and the {disfmarker} but there are some issues of this timing , um , in the recordings
Turn 489, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 490, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 491, D (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 492, B (PhD): So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things , you can't {disfmarker} you can't just look {disfmarker}
Turn 493, E (Grad): Well . are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time - synchronous ? Is that what you 're referring to ?
Turn 494, C (Professor): 
Turn 495, E (Grad): That seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a very accurate {disfmarker}
Turn 496, F (PhD): I don't thi I d I don't think that was the issue .
Turn 497, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} yeah , that was sort of a side issue .
Turn 498, E (Grad): I didn't think so either .
Turn 499, F (PhD): The issue was that you have {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} you have have {disfmarker} you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels .
Turn 500, D (PhD): And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so there are some things available , and I don't know too much about this area where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them , and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference .
Turn 501, E (Grad): Right , which should be pretty straight forward .
Turn 502, D (PhD): Which a at least is well defined , and
Turn 503, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 504, D (PhD): um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't {disfmarker} I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly {pause} and not {disfmarker} in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now , so . Well less than a week . So {disfmarker} um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point .
Turn 505, B (PhD): Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ?
Turn 506, E (Grad): Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say .
Turn 507, F (PhD): I haven't checked those yet .
Turn 508, E (Grad): C
Turn 509, F (PhD): It 's very tedious to check these .
Turn 510, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 511, F (PhD): Um , we would really need , ideally , a transcriber {vocalsound} to time mark the {disfmarker} you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends {comment} of contiguous speech . Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and , you know , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your {disfmarker} of your forced alignments .
Turn 512, B (PhD): Because {disfmarker} really the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal {disfmarker} an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .
Turn 513, E (Grad): Oh , MNCM . 
Turn 514, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 515, B (PhD): We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries , so {disfmarker}
Turn 516, F (PhD): No , that 's how I 've been looking at it .
Turn 517, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 518, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 519, F (PhD): I mean , I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly ,
Turn 520, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 521, F (PhD): but {vocalsound} you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't .
Turn 522, B (PhD): Right , exactly . So that 's why I was wondering if it {disfmarker}
Turn 523, F (PhD): so , so {disfmarker}
Turn 524, B (PhD): I mean , maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that
Turn 525, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 526, B (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 527, F (PhD): I haven't {disfmarker} I ha just haven't had the time to , um , do the same procedure on one of the {disfmarker} so I would need a k I would need a channel that has {vocalsound} a speaker whose {disfmarker} who has a lot of overlap but s you know , is a non - lapel mike . And , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} where preferably , also there 's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot .
Turn 528, E (Grad): Hmm !
Turn 529, F (PhD): So , I {disfmarker}
Turn 530, E (Grad): So a meeting with me in it .
Turn 531, F (PhD): maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would be willing to
Turn 532, B (PhD): We c you know what ? Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these .
Turn 533, F (PhD): you know , hand
Turn 534, B (PhD): Cuz you can see the seat numbers , and then you can see what type of mike they were using . And so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to Adam at one of the meetings {disfmarker}
Turn 535, D (PhD): Actually y we can tell from the data that we have ,
Turn 536, F (PhD): From the insertions , maybe ?
Turn 537, D (PhD): um , yeah , there 's a way to tell .
Turn 538, F (PhD): fr fr from the {disfmarker}
Turn 539, D (PhD): It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,
Turn 540, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 541, D (PhD): and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that . So {disfmarker} so I guess that 's sort of a last {disfmarker} ther there 're sort of a few things we could do . One is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments . Another one was to try to get {disfmarker} somehow align Thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have . But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation . But maybe there 's something that could be done .
Turn 542, B (PhD): What {disfmarker} what is {disfmarker} why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the HLT {disfmarker} I mean for the Eurospeech paper ?
Turn 543, D (PhD): Well , I guess I {disfmarker} I wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers . Like if we {disfmarker} if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper . It 's not that we need it to be automatic . But without knowing where the real words are , in time {disfmarker}
Turn 544, B (PhD): So it was to get {disfmarker} it was to get more data and better {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to squeeze the boundaries in .
Turn 545, D (PhD): To {disfmarker} to know what an overlap really {disfmarker} if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a segment correlated with an overlap ,
Turn 546, B (PhD): Ah , OK . Yeah .
Turn 547, D (PhD): and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . So , um , if we d it might be possible to take Thilo 's output and like if you have , um , like right now these meetings are all ,
Turn 548, E (Grad): Ugh ! I forgot the digital camera again .
Turn 549, D (PhD): um ,
Turn 550, E (Grad): Every meeting !
Turn 551, D (PhD): you know , they 're time - aligned , so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word , if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out
Turn 552, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 553, D (PhD): because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word . But , um , you know , if there are things {disfmarker}
Turn 554, E (Grad): Two words .
Turn 555, D (PhD): Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here , and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you , so , um {disfmarker}
Turn 556, B (PhD): Thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case {disfmarker}
Turn 557, D (PhD): Well it w it would , but , um , we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin
Turn 558, E (Grad): Thilo 's will . But .
Turn 559, D (PhD): and we don't really know , I mean ,
Turn 560, A (Postdoc): Well it 's a merging problem . If you had a {disfmarker} if you had a s if you had a script which would {disfmarker}
Turn 561, D (PhD): yeah it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 562, A (Postdoc): I 've thought about this , um , and I 've discussed {disfmarker} I 've discussed it with Thilo ,
Turn 563, D (PhD): I mean , if you have any ideas . I would {disfmarker}
Turn 564, A (Postdoc): um , the , I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} in principle I could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree , but there is this problem of slippage ,
Turn 565, E (Grad): Well maybe {disfmarker} Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful .
Turn 566, A (Postdoc): yeah .
Turn 567, D (PhD): Right . I mean , that {disfmarker} that would be really helpful . That was sort of another possibility .
Turn 568, E (Grad): You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts , or at least a single phrase
Turn 569, A (Postdoc): Well they {disfmarker} they can be stretched .
Turn 570, E (Grad): in most of the bins .
Turn 571, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 572, A (Postdoc): I wouldn't make that generalization cuz sometimes people will say , " And then I " and there 's a long pause
Turn 573, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 574, A (Postdoc): and finish the sentence and {disfmarker} and sometimes it looks coherent and {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a simple problem . But it 's really {disfmarker} And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with {disfmarker} with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either . I mean , we 've i th it 's like you have a merging problem plus {disfmarker} so merging plus this problem of , uh , not {disfmarker}
Turn 575, E (Grad): Right . Hmm !
Turn 576, A (Postdoc): y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement , but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask .
Turn 577, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 578, E (Grad): Yes .
Turn 579, A (Postdoc): And so i and may you know , I mean , it 's {disfmarker} I think that there always {disfmarker} th there would have to be some hand - tweaking , but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things . I 've {disfmarker} I 've discussed it with Thilo and I mean {disfmarker} in terms of not him doing it , but we {disfmarker} we discussed some of the parameters of that and how hard it would be to {disfmarker} in principle {disfmarker} to write something that would do that .
Turn 580, D (PhD): I mean , I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with , then we have a good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to .
Turn 581, A (Postdoc): Well , it 's just , you know , a matter of we had the revolution {disfmarker} we had the revolution of improved , uh , interface , um , one month too late ,
Turn 582, D (PhD): So I 'm no I don't know if this
Turn 583, E (Grad): Oh . Tools .
Turn 584, A (Postdoc): but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution ,
Turn 585, D (PhD): Oh it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 586, A (Postdoc): so it 's just a matter of {disfmarker} of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .
Turn 587, D (PhD): yeah .
Turn 588, E (Grad): Right . And we 'll just have to see how hard that is .
Turn 589, A (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right .
Turn 590, E (Grad): So {disfmarker} so whether the corrections take too much time .
Turn 591, A (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 592, E (Grad): I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them .
Turn 593, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 594, A (Postdoc): Good point .
Turn 595, D (PhD): But he {disfmarker} he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly ,
Turn 596, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 597, E (Grad): Spurious .
Turn 598, D (PhD): but that might be OK , an
Turn 599, E (Grad): It might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing .
Turn 600, D (PhD): Right . And you can also see in the waveform {disfmarker} exac
Turn 601, E (Grad): What do you think , Jane ?
Turn 602, D (PhD): yeah .
Turn 603, C (Professor): If you can feel confident that what the {disfmarker} yeah , that there 's actually something {disfmarker}
Turn 604, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 605, C (Professor): that you 're not gonna miss something ,
Turn 606, E (Grad): Yeah . Cuz then {disfmarker} then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time .
Turn 607, C (Professor): yeah .
Turn 608, D (PhD): I think it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 609, A (Postdoc): Well the problem is I {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a really good question , and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down {disfmarker} I mean , i it depends on how lar th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or {disfmarker} or vice versa . It 's not a simple question . But , you know , I mean , in principle , like , you know , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier .
Turn 610, E (Grad): Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment , right ? Because you would say {disfmarker} You would have to determine what the surroundings were .
Turn 611, D (PhD): You could just say it 's a noise , though , and write , you know , a post - processor will just {disfmarker} all you have to do is just {disfmarker}
Turn 612, E (Grad): If it 's really a noise .
Turn 613, D (PhD): or just say it 's {disfmarker} just put " X , " you know , like " not speech " or something ,
Turn 614, A (Postdoc): I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,
Turn 615, D (PhD): and then you can get {disfmarker} Yeah , or
Turn 616, A (Postdoc): because you have to , uh , maneuver around on the {disfmarker} on both windows then .
Turn 617, E (Grad): To add or to delete ?
Turn 618, A (Postdoc): To delete .
Turn 619, D (PhD): Anyways , so I {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker}
Turn 620, E (Grad): OK . That {disfmarker} Maybe that 's an interface issue that might be addressable .
Turn 621, A (Postdoc): It 's possible .
Turn 622, E (Grad): But I think it 's the semantics that are {disfmarker} that are questionable to me , that you delete something {disfmarker} So let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here . Well , is that part of the speech ? Is it part of the nonspeech ? I mean , w what do you embed it in ?
Turn 623, D (PhD): There 's something nice , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the stuff that Thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it . Because then when you align it , then the alignment can {disfmarker} you can put a reject model or whatever ,
Turn 624, E (Grad): Oh , I see . So then they could just like put {disfmarker} Oh that 's what you meant by just put an " X " there .
Turn 625, D (PhD): and you 're consistent with th the automatic system ,
Turn 626, E (Grad): Uh , that 's an interesting idea .
Turn 627, D (PhD): whereas if you delete it {disfmarker}
Turn 628, E (Grad): So {disfmarker} so all they {disfmarker} So that all they would have to do is put like an " X " there .
Turn 629, D (PhD): Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod
Turn 630, E (Grad): So blank for {disfmarker} blank for silence , " S " " S " for speech , " X " " X " for something else .
Turn 631, D (PhD): whatever , yeah . That 's actually a better way to do it cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than {disfmarker}
Turn 632, A (Postdoc): Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that {disfmarker} that you can have speech and noise in s
Turn 633, D (PhD): I mean if it 's just as easy , but {disfmarker}
Turn 634, A (Postdoc): uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases , and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around . It 's not a simple {disfmarker} not a simple problem .
Turn 635, D (PhD): Anyway , quick question , though , at a high level do people think , let 's just say that we 're moving to this new era of like using the , um , pre - segmented t you know , non - synchronous conversations , does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr I mean , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 636, E (Grad): Well , I think we 'll have to , eventually . And my hope was that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it .
Turn 637, D (PhD): Right . That was everybody 's hope .
Turn 638, E (Grad): But if we can't {disfmarker}
Turn 639, D (PhD): And maybe we can for the non - lapel , but
Turn 640, E (Grad): But if we can't , then maybe we just have to {disfmarker}
Turn 641, D (PhD): is it worth {disfmarker} if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're {disfmarker} we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time .
Turn 642, E (Grad): Well , I 'm thinking {disfmarker} are you talking about for a paper , or are talking about for the corpus .
Turn 643, D (PhD): Uh {disfmarker} uh , that 's a good question actually .
Turn 644, E (Grad): I mean cuz for the corpus it would be nice if everything were {disfmarker}
Turn 645, D (PhD): Actually that 's a good question because we 'd have to completely redo those meetings , and we have like ten of them now .
Turn 646, E (Grad): We wouldn't have to re - do them , we would just have to edit them .
Turn 647, A (Postdoc): Well , and also , I mean , I still haven't {disfmarker} I still haven't given up on forced alignment .
Turn 648, D (PhD): No , you 're right , actually {disfmarker}
Turn 649, A (Postdoc): I think that when Brian comes , this 'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well b
Turn 650, E (Grad): When {disfmarker}
Turn 651, A (Postdoc): when Brian Kingsbury comes .
Turn 652, E (Grad): Oh , Brian . You s I thought you said Ryan . And it 's like , " Who 's Ryan ? "
Turn 653, A (Postdoc): Yeah , good question .
Turn 654, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 655, A (Postdoc): Well , Ryan could come .
Turn 656, D (PhD): Uh , no , that 's a good point , though , because for feature extraction like for prosody or something , I mean , the meetings we have now , it 's a good chunk of data {disfmarker}
Turn 657, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 658, D (PhD): we need to get a decent f OK .
Turn 659, A (Postdoc): That 's what my hope has been ,
Turn 660, D (PhD): So we should at least try it even if we can't ,
Turn 661, A (Postdoc): and that 's what {disfmarker} that 's what {disfmarker} you know , ever since the {disfmarker} the February meeting that I transcribed from last year , forced alignment has been on the {disfmarker} on the table as a way of cleaning them up later .
Turn 662, D (PhD): right ?
Turn 663, E (Grad): On the table , right ?
Turn 664, A (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and so I 'm hopeful that that 's possible . I know that there 's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes ,
Turn 665, F (PhD): There 's {disfmarker}
Turn 666, A (Postdoc): but {disfmarker}
Turn 667, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 668, D (PhD): I mean , we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where {disfmarker} I mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor . Right ?
Turn 669, B (PhD): Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments .
Turn 670, D (PhD): And so you 're {disfmarker}
Turn 671, A (Postdoc): I agree . I agree .
Turn 672, B (PhD): We were always gonna run them past somebody .
Turn 673, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 674, A (Postdoc): Absolutely .
Turn 675, D (PhD): So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments .
Turn 676, F (PhD): I 'm probably going to spend another day or so trying to improve things by , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} by using , um , acoustic adaptation . Um , the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Right now I 'm using the unadapted models for the forced alignments , and it 's possible that you get considerably better results if you , uh , manage to adapt the , {vocalsound} uh , phone models to the speaker and the reject model to the {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to all the other speech . Um , so
Turn 677, B (PhD): Could you {disfmarker} could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ?
Turn 678, C (Professor): That 's what he just said .
Turn 679, E (Grad): That 's what he was saying .
Turn 680, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 681, F (PhD): That 's what I just said .
Turn 682, B (PhD): Oh , not just the speech from that {disfmarker} of the other people from that channel ,
Turn 683, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 684, B (PhD): but the speech from the a actual other channels .
Turn 685, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 686, F (PhD): Oh , oh , I see . Um ,
Turn 687, C (Professor): Oh .
Turn 688, E (Grad): I don't think so . I don't think that would work ,
Turn 689, F (PhD): No , it {disfmarker}
Turn 690, E (Grad): right ? Because you 'd {disfmarker} A lot of it 's dominated by channel properties .
Turn 691, F (PhD): th Exactly .
Turn 692, D (PhD): But what you do wanna do is take the , even if it 's klugey , take the segments {disfmarker} the synchronous segments , the ones from the HLT paper , where only that speaker was talking .
Turn 693, F (PhD): So you want to u
Turn 694, D (PhD): Use those for adaptation , cuz if you {disfmarker} if you use everything , then you get all the cross - talk in the adaptation , and it 's just sort of blurred .
Turn 695, F (PhD): That 's a good point .
Turn 696, B (PhD): If you {disfmarker}
Turn 697, F (PhD): Yep .
Turn 698, D (PhD): And that we know , I mean , we have that . And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged .
Turn 699, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 700, D (PhD): That 's not completely negligible . Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so .
Turn 701, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 702, E (Grad): Cool . I thought it was higher than that , that 's pr
Turn 703, D (PhD): It really {disfmarker} it depends a lot . This is just sort of an overall {disfmarker}
Turn 704, F (PhD): So .
Turn 705, C (Professor): Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech , a redo of the HLT paper .
Turn 706, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 707, C (Professor): That {disfmarker} I don't wanna do that ,
Turn 708, E (Grad): Yeah , I 'm doing that for AVIOS .
Turn 709, C (Professor): but .
Turn 710, D (PhD): Yeah . But I think we 're {disfmarker} oh , Morgan 's talk went very well , I think .
Turn 711, C (Professor): Bleep .
Turn 712, E (Grad): Uh , " bleep " . Yeah , really .
Turn 713, D (PhD): I think Morgan 's talk went very well it woke {disfmarker}
Turn 714, A (Postdoc): Excellent .
Turn 715, D (PhD): you know , it was really a well presented {disfmarker} and got people laughing {disfmarker}
Turn 716, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 717, F (PhD): Some good jokes in it ?
Turn 718, E (Grad): Especially the batteried meter popping up ,
Turn 719, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 720, E (Grad): that was hilarious . Right when you were talking about that .
Turn 721, C (Professor): You know , that wa that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged ,
Turn 722, E (Grad): It 's full . Yeah .
Turn 723, C (Professor): yeah .
Turn 724, A (Postdoc): You said , " Speaking about energy " , or {vocalsound} something .
Turn 725, E (Grad): But that was funny .
Turn 726, A (Postdoc): That was very nice .
Turn 727, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 728, E (Grad): He {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he was onto the bullet points about talking about the {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} the little hand - held , and trying to get lower power and so on ,
Turn 729, F (PhD): Po - low power
Turn 730, E (Grad): and Microsoft pops up a little window saying " Your batteries are now fully charged . "
Turn 731, A (Postdoc): That 's great .
Turn 732, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 733, E (Grad): I 'm thinking about scripting that for my talk , you know , put {disfmarker} put a little script in there to say " Your batteries are low " right when I 'm saying that .
Turn 734, C (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . No I mean , i in {disfmarker} in your case , I mean , you were joking about it , but , I mean , your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences , it 's not {disfmarker} these are conferences that have d really different emphases . Whereas HLT and {disfmarker} and Eurospeech , pretty {disfmarker} pretty {disfmarker} pretty similar , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can't see really just putting in the same thing ,
Turn 735, E (Grad): Are too close , yeah .
Turn 736, D (PhD): No , I d I don't think that paper is really {disfmarker}
Turn 737, C (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 738, D (PhD): the HLT paper is really more of a introduction - to - the - project paper , and , um {disfmarker}
Turn 739, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 740, E (Grad): Yeah , for Eurospeech we want some results if we can get them .
Turn 741, D (PhD): Well , yeah , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} probably wouldn't make sense ,
Turn 742, C (Professor): Or some {disfmarker} or some {disfmarker} I mean , I would see Eurospeech {disfmarker} if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions .
Turn 743, D (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 744, C (Professor): These will be things that are particular things , aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it .
Turn 745, D (PhD): Right , right .
Turn 746, E (Grad): Detail , yeah . Overall .
Turn 747, A (Postdoc): I did go through one of these meetings . I had , uh , one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the , uh , NSA meetings , and then I went through afterwards and double - checked it so that one is really very {disfmarker} very accurate .
Turn 748, D (PhD): Oh .
Turn 749, A (Postdoc): I men I mentioned the link . I sent {disfmarker} You know that one ?
Turn 750, D (PhD): Oh , so {disfmarker}
Turn 751, G (Grad): The {disfmarker} which one ? I 'm sorry .
Turn 752, A (Postdoc): Um , I 'm trying to remember {disfmarker} I don't remember the number off hand .
Turn 753, E (Grad): Those are all {disfmarker}
Turn 754, A (Postdoc): It 's one of the NSA 's . I sent email before the conference , before last week .
Turn 755, G (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 756, A (Postdoc): Bef - What I mean is Wednesday , Thursday .
Turn 757, D (PhD): That might {disfmarker} might have been the one {disfmarker} one of the ones that we did .
Turn 758, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 759, A (Postdoc): I 'm sure that that one 's accurate , I 've been through it {vocalsound} myself .
Turn 760, D (PhD): So that might actually be useful but they 're all non - native speakers .
Turn 761, F (PhD): So we could compare before and after
Turn 762, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 763, F (PhD): and see {disfmarker}
Turn 764, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , that 's what I was gonna say . The problem with those , they 're all German .
Turn 765, F (PhD): oh , Darn !
Turn 766, G (Grad): Yeah , that 's the problem with the NSA speakers .
Turn 767, D (PhD): And e and e and extremely hard to follow , like word - wise ,
Turn 768, E (Grad): So .
Turn 769, D (PhD): I bet the transcri I mean , I have no idea what they 're talking about ,
Turn 770, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 771, A (Postdoc): I corrected it for a number of the words .
Turn 772, D (PhD): so ,
Turn 773, A (Postdoc): I 'm sure that , um , they 're {disfmarker} they 're accurate now .
Turn 774, D (PhD): um ,
Turn 775, F (PhD): Uh , actually I have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to go .
Turn 776, D (PhD): I mean , this is tough for a language model probably {disfmarker} 
Turn 777, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 778, D (PhD): but {disfmarker} but that might be useful just for speech .
Turn 779, C (Professor): Well .
Turn 780, E (Grad): OK , Andreas is leaving {disfmarker} leaving the building . Mm - hmm .
Turn 781, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 782, E (Grad): See ya .
Turn 783, C (Professor): See ya . I don't think we 'll go much longer .
Turn 784, E (Grad): Um , oh , before you l go {disfmarker} I guess it 's alright for you to talk a little without the mike {disfmarker} I noticed you adjusting the mike a lot , did it not fit you well ? Oh .
Turn 785, A (Postdoc): Well I won I noticed when you turned your head , it would {disfmarker} it would tilt .
Turn 786, E (Grad): Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough , or {disfmarker}
Turn 787, D (PhD): Maybe the {disfmarker} yeah , the s thing that you have tightened @ @ ,
Turn 788, B (PhD): Actually if {disfmarker} if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the {disfmarker} the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down .
Turn 789, D (PhD): oh .
Turn 790, E (Grad): OK . Anyway .
Turn 791, C (Professor): Yeah . OK , see ya .
Turn 792, E (Grad): Cuz , I 'm just thinking , you know , we were {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 've been talking about changing the mikes , uh , for a while ,
Turn 793, G (Grad): 
Turn 794, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 795, E (Grad): and if these aren't {disfmarker} acoustically they seem really good , but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things .
Turn 796, A (Postdoc): I think it 's com This is the first time I 've worn this , I find it very comfortable .
Turn 797, E (Grad): I find it very comfortable too , but , uh , it looked like Andreas was having problems , and I think Morgan was saying it {disfmarker}
Turn 798, C (Professor): Well , but I had it on {disfmarker} I had it on this morning and it was fine .
Turn 799, B (PhD): Can I see that ?
Turn 800, E (Grad): Oh , oh you did wear it this morning ?
Turn 801, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 802, E (Grad): OK , it 's off , so you can put it on .
Turn 803, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} yeah , I don't want it on , I just {disfmarker} I just want to , um , say what I think is a problem with this . If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here , then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way .
Turn 804, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 805, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 806, B (PhD): Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here ,
Turn 807, E (Grad): It 's more balanced .
Turn 808, B (PhD): right ? Yeah .
Turn 809, A (Postdoc): Oh !
Turn 810, B (PhD): Then it {disfmarker} then it falls back this way so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 811, D (PhD): So we have to
Turn 812, E (Grad): Well wh what it 's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown , and so that should be {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker}
Turn 813, A (Postdoc): Ah .
Turn 814, E (Grad): if it 's right against your head there , which is what it 's supposed to be , that balances it so it doesn't slide up .
Turn 815, B (PhD): So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance .
Turn 816, E (Grad): Yep , right {disfmarker} right below {disfmarker} if you feel the back of your head , you feel a little lump ,
Turn 817, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 818, E (Grad): um , and so it 's supposed to be right under that .
Turn 819, B (PhD): So it 's really supposed to go more like this than like this .
Turn 820, E (Grad): Yes , exactly .
Turn 821, B (PhD): But then isn't that going to {disfmarker} Well , I guess you can control that .
Turn 822, E (Grad): That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that tilts , right ? In lots and lots of different ways .
Turn 823, D (PhD): So I 'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize ,
Turn 824, E (Grad): About heads ?
Turn 825, D (PhD): but does seem , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 826, B (PhD): It would be an advantage .
Turn 827, A (Postdoc): Well , wonder if it 's {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair .
Turn 828, C (Professor): Well , we should {disfmarker} We shou we should work on compressing the heads , and {disfmarker}
Turn 829, E (Grad): I think probably it was {disfmarker} Yeah . It probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head . I mean , so the directions do talk about bending it to your size , which is not really what we want .
Turn 830, B (PhD): The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back .
Turn 831, C (Professor): Yeah
Turn 832, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 833, C (Professor): that 's good !
Turn 834, A (Postdoc): What did you say ?
Turn 835, D (PhD): A little ,
Turn 836, E (Grad): wh
Turn 837, C (Professor): Hang a five pound weight off the {disfmarker} off the back .
Turn 838, B (PhD): Hang a five pound weight off the back .
Turn 839, D (PhD): um ,
Turn 840, E (Grad): We did that {disfmarker}
Turn 841, C (Professor): Weight .
Turn 842, E (Grad): We {disfmarker} at Boeing I used {disfmarker} I was doing augmented reality so they had head - mounts on , and we {disfmarker} we had a little jury - rigged one with a welder 's helmet ,
Turn 843, B (PhD): Counter - balance .
Turn 844, E (Grad): and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it {vocalsound} as a counter - balance .
Turn 845, C (Professor): Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people . If people {disfmarker} those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something , and {disfmarker}
Turn 846, E (Grad): Yeah !
Turn 847, C (Professor): and {disfmarker} um ,
Turn 848, E (Grad): Anyway .
Turn 849, C (Professor): um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ? Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there and {disfmarker} and , uh , um , so they {disfmarker} they have their {disfmarker} their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes ,
Turn 850, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 851, C (Professor): and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz
Turn 852, D (PhD): And arrays ,
Turn 853, C (Professor): sort of {disfmarker} and the array .
Turn 854, E (Grad): And arrays ,
Turn 855, C (Professor): Yeah , so they were {disfmarker}
Turn 856, D (PhD): which is the i interesting {disfmarker}
Turn 857, E (Grad): yep . And cameras .
Turn 858, C (Professor): And yeah , like multiple {disfmarker} multiple video cameras coverin covering every {disfmarker} everybody {disfmarker} every place in the room ,
Turn 859, D (PhD): and video , right .
Turn 860, C (Professor): uh , the {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with {disfmarker} well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine ,
Turn 861, E (Grad): Fifty - nine elements .
Turn 862, C (Professor): they might go down to fifty - seven Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head . I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for ,
Turn 863, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 864, C (Professor): but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed ,
Turn 865, E (Grad): Oh , that 's right .
Turn 866, C (Professor): and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really {disfmarker} there 's really two recording systems .
Turn 867, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 868, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 869, D (PhD): That 's a great idea .
Turn 870, C (Professor): So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two {disfmarker} two recording systems , one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels . And the sixty - four channel one is for the array , but they 've got some empty channels there , and anyway they {disfmarker} like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for the KEMAR head if they go {disfmarker} go with that .
Turn 871, E (Grad): Right . Yeah , it is a good idea .
Turn 872, C (Professor): So .
Turn 873, E (Grad): Yeah , h uh , J Jonathan Fiscus did say that , uh , they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels
Turn 874, D (PhD): Mm - hmm
Turn 875, E (Grad): and that they 've found that 's just not a big deal .
Turn 876, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 877, E (Grad): So .
Turn 878, C (Professor): Yeah , I 'm not {pause} too worried about that . I was thinking {disfmarker}
Turn 879, D (PhD): But they 're still planning to do like fake {disfmarker}
Turn 880, E (Grad): Scenario - based .
Turn 881, D (PhD): they have to do something like that ,
Turn 882, E (Grad): Y right .
Turn 883, D (PhD): right .
Turn 884, E (Grad): Their {disfmarker} their legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise .
Turn 885, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 886, E (Grad): But it sounded like they were {pause} pretty well thought out
Turn 887, D (PhD): Yeah , th that 's true .
Turn 888, E (Grad): and they 're {disfmarker} they 're gonna be real meetings ,
Turn 889, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 890, E (Grad): it 's just that they 're with str with people who would not be meeting otherwise .
Turn 891, B (PhD): Did {disfmarker} did they give a talk on this or was this informal ?
Turn 892, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 893, E (Grad): So .
Turn 894, D (PhD): No .
Turn 895, E (Grad): No .
Turn 896, C (Professor): No , we just had some discussions , various discussions with them .
Turn 897, E (Grad): It 's just informal .
Turn 898, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 899, E (Grad): Yeah , I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks . They seemed like a good group .
Turn 900, B (PhD): What was the , um {disfmarker} the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ?
Turn 901, C (Professor): Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you {disfmarker} have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings ,
Turn 902, A (Postdoc): Mmm , yeah .
Turn 903, C (Professor): but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using {disfmarker} using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works . Uh , so in {disfmarker} in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with
Turn 904, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 905, C (Professor): uh , like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ? And then they went to {disfmarker}
Turn 906, E (Grad): The - their Broadcast News was their acoustic models and then all the other tasks were much simpler .
Turn 907, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 908, E (Grad): So they were command and control and that sort of thing .
Turn 909, C (Professor): TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal .
Turn 910, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 911, B (PhD): What was their rough {disfmarker} what was their conclusion ?
Turn 912, E (Grad): Yeah , read Wall Street Journal . It works .
Turn 913, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 914, D (PhD): Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good paper , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 915, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 916, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , that was one of the ones that I liked .
Turn 917, D (PhD): Bring the {disfmarker}
Turn 918, E (Grad): That {disfmarker} It not only works , in some cases it was better , which I thought was pretty interesting , but that 's cuz they didn't control for parameters . So .
Turn 919, C (Professor): Probably .
Turn 920, E (Grad): You know , the Broadcast News nets were {disfmarker} not nets ,
Turn 921, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 922, B (PhD): Did they ever try going {disfmarker} going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks ,
Turn 923, E (Grad): acoustic models {comment} were a lot more complex .
Turn 924, B (PhD): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 925, E (Grad): n Not in that paper .
Turn 926, C (Professor): That might be hard .
Turn 927, E (Grad): Yeah , well , one of the big problems with that is {disfmarker} is often the simpler task isn't fully {disfmarker} doesn't have all the phones in it ,
Turn 928, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 929, E (Grad): and that {disfmarker} that makes it very hard .
Turn 930, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 931, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 932, E (Grad): But I 've done the same thing . I 've been using Broadcast News nets for digits ,
Turn 933, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 934, E (Grad): like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ? That 's what I did .
Turn 935, C (Professor): Yeah , sure .
Turn 936, E (Grad): So . It works .
Turn 937, C (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , and they have {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} they have better adaptation than we had than that {disfmarker} that system ,
Turn 938, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 939, C (Professor): so they {disfmarker} um ,
Turn 940, E (Grad): You mean they have some .
Turn 941, C (Professor): yeah , we should probably what would {disfmarker} actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this , but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that {disfmarker} that , uh , you know , got our interest , and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what {disfmarker} what was good about the conference ,
Turn 942, E (Grad): Present . Yep . Do a trip report .
Turn 943, C (Professor): yeah .
Turn 944, D (PhD): Well , the summarization stuff was interesting , I mean , I don't know anything about that field , but for this proposal on meeting summarization , um , I mean , it 's sort of a far cry because they weren't working with meeting type data , but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches ,
Turn 945, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 946, B (PhD): Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ?
Turn 947, D (PhD): so . Well there 're {disfmarker} this was the last day ,
Turn 948, E (Grad): A lot of different ones .
Turn 949, A (Postdoc): R I think {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .
Turn 950, D (PhD): but , I mean , there 's {disfmarker} that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field , I {disfmarker} I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference ,
Turn 951, B (PhD): Was {disfmarker} were there folks from BBN presenting ?
Turn 952, D (PhD): but yet there was , let 's see , this was on the last day , Mitre , BBN , and , um , Prager {disfmarker}
Turn 953, E (Grad): Mitre , BBN , IBM . Uh ,
Turn 954, A (Postdoc): Maryland .
Turn 955, D (PhD): um , I wo it was {disfmarker}
Turn 956, C (Professor): Columbia have anything ? No .
Turn 957, D (PhD): no it was {disfmarker}
Turn 958, E (Grad): Wasn't {disfmarker} Who {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who did the order one ?
Turn 959, D (PhD): this was Wednesday morning . The sentence ordering one , was that Barselou , and these guys ?
Turn 960, E (Grad): Ugh ! {comment} I 'm just so bad at that .
Turn 961, A (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 962, D (PhD): Anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it 's in the program , I should have read it to remind myself , but that 's sort of useful and I think like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it 'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts cuz we already have {disfmarker}
Turn 963, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 964, E (Grad): Yeah , we do have word transcripts .
Turn 965, D (PhD): you know , yeah .
Turn 966, E (Grad): So .
Turn 967, A (Postdoc): Well , I like the idea that Adam had of {disfmarker} of , um , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have because it would be easy to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to do that just , you know , and {disfmarker} and
Turn 968, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 969, A (Postdoc): it has to be , though , someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing .
Turn 970, E (Grad): Someone who actually does take notes , um , {vocalsound} I 'm very bad at note - taking .
Turn 971, D (PhD): But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like {disfmarker} just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not ,
Turn 972, E (Grad): I always write down the wrong things .
Turn 973, A (Postdoc): I do take notes .
Turn 974, D (PhD): and that 's what 's {disfmarker} was sort of interesting to me is that there 's different ways to do it ,
Turn 975, E (Grad): A judge .
Turn 976, D (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 977, B (PhD): Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ?
Turn 978, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 979, D (PhD): Hm - umm . No .
Turn 980, A (Postdoc): It was an interesting session . One of those w
Turn 981, E (Grad): And as I said , I like the Microsoft talk on {pause} scaling issues in , uh , word sense disambiguation ,
Turn 982, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 983, E (Grad): that was interesting .
Turn 984, C (Professor): Yeah , that was an interesting discussion ,
Turn 985, E (Grad): The {disfmarker}
Turn 986, C (Professor): uh , I
Turn 987, E (Grad): It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it was the only one {disfmarker} It was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about .
Turn 988, D (PhD): The data issue comes up all the ti
Turn 989, C (Professor): Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked ,
Turn 990, E (Grad): So .
Turn 991, C (Professor): but I didn't wanna {disfmarker} I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about ,
Turn 992, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 993, C (Professor): uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative , but {disfmarker} but , uh , I mean , the missing thi so {disfmarker} so what they were saying {disfmarker} it 's one of these things {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} you know , all you need is more data , sort of {disfmarker} But I mea i wh it {disfmarker} @ @ that 's {disfmarker} that 's dissing it , uh , improperly , I mean , it was a nice study . Uh , they were doing this {disfmarker} it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was {disfmarker}
Turn 994, D (PhD): Yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker}
Turn 995, E (Grad): Well , it sort of was .
Turn 996, C (Professor): was it w was it word - sense ? Yes .
Turn 997, E (Grad): But it was {disfmarker} it was a very simple case of " to " versus " too " versus " two " and " there " , " their " , " they 're " {disfmarker}
Turn 998, D (PhD): And there and their and {disfmarker}
Turn 999, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah . OK .
Turn 1000, D (PhD): and that you could do better with more data , I mean , that 's clearly statistically {disfmarker}
Turn 1001, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1002, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1003, C (Professor): And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data , and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , uh , argues about {disfmarker} about , " Oh my {disfmarker} my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . " And , uh , they were {disfmarker} started off with a million words that they used , which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using . So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion . And then they had this log scale showing a {disfmarker} you know , and {disfmarker} and naturally everything gets {disfmarker}
Turn 1004, E (Grad): Them being beep , {comment} they went off to a billion .
Turn 1005, C (Professor): they {disfmarker} well , it 's a big company , I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative ,
Turn 1006, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1007, C (Professor): but i i i
Turn 1008, D (PhD): You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training ?
Turn 1009, E (Grad): Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it .
Turn 1010, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1011, E (Grad): So that 's what they used as training data . It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct .
Turn 1012, C (Professor): OK . But , I mean , yes . Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} that you got better and better performance with more and more data . Um , but the {disfmarker} the real point was that the {disfmarker} the different learning machines are sort of all over the place , and {disfmarker} and by {disfmarker} by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture , so ,
Turn 1013, B (PhD): This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora .
Turn 1014, C (Professor): uh , That {disfmarker}
Turn 1015, B (PhD): That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b
Turn 1016, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1017, E (Grad): Are irrelevant .
Turn 1018, B (PhD): are irrelevant once you get a real recognizer at the back - end .
Turn 1019, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1020, D (PhD): If you add more data ? Or {disfmarker}
Turn 1021, B (PhD): You know ?
Turn 1022, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1023, D (PhD): Huh .
Turn 1024, C (Professor): Yeah , could well be . So {disfmarker} so , I mean , that was {disfmarker} that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point , but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant which is not at {disfmarker} n t as for as I know in {disfmarker} in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true . What i what is {disfmarker} is true is that different learning machines have different properties , and you wanna know what those properties are . And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are . We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and {disfmarker} and some other kinds use more computation and some are {disfmarker} are hav have limited kind of discrimination , but are just easy to use , and others are {disfmarker}
Turn 1025, B (PhD): But doesn't their conclusion just sort of {disfmarker} you could have guessed that before they even started ? Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better ,
Turn 1026, C (Professor): You would guess {disfmarker}
Turn 1027, B (PhD): then as you approach {disfmarker} there 's a point where you can't get any better , right ? You get everything right .
Turn 1028, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1029, D (PhD): It 's just no {disfmarker}
Turn 1030, E (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1031, B (PhD): So they 're all approaching .
Turn 1032, E (Grad): No , but there was still a spread . They weren't all up They weren't converging .
Turn 1033, B (PhD): But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together .
Turn 1034, C (Professor): It w
Turn 1035, E (Grad): They were all still spread . But they {disfmarker} Right , right . Sure . But they hadn't even come close to that point . All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion .
Turn 1036, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1037, B (PhD): But they 're all going the same way , right ? So you have to get closer .
Turn 1038, C (Professor): Eventually . O one would
Turn 1039, E (Grad): But they didn't get closer .
Turn 1040, B (PhD): Oh they didn't ?
Turn 1041, C (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1042, E (Grad): They just switched position .
Turn 1043, C (Professor): well that 's getting cl I mean , yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true ,
Turn 1044, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1045, C (Professor): but {disfmarker} but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case , but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different , I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in {disfmarker} in Broadcast News ,
Turn 1046, D (PhD): Well it 's different for different tasks .
Turn 1047, E (Grad): Yeah . It was Liz . Yeah .
Turn 1048, C (Professor): yeah .
Turn 1049, D (PhD): So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it {disfmarker} disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better , right ? You 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you can assume similar distributions ,
Turn 1050, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1051, D (PhD): but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , uh , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize ,
Turn 1052, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 1053, D (PhD): so .
Turn 1054, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1055, E (Grad): But , I think one of their p They {disfmarker} they had a couple points . w {comment} Uh , I think one of them was that " Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are {disfmarker} is better " . Less memory , faster operation , simpler . Right ? Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well
Turn 1056, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1057, E (Grad): when you got {disfmarker} gave it a lot more data . And then also they were saying , " Well , m You have access to a lot more data . Why are you sticking with a million words ? " I mean , their point was that this million - word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old . And everyone is still using it , so .
Turn 1058, C (Professor): Yeah . But anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's just the {disfmarker} the i it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd {vocalsound} came up with
Turn 1059, E (Grad): But we could talk about this stuff , I think this would be fun to do .  Right .
Turn 1060, C (Professor): that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way ,
Turn 1061, E (Grad): Machine - learning .
Turn 1062, C (Professor): and {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the , uh , one {disfmarker} one person ga g g got up and made a {disfmarker} a brief defense , uh , but it was a different kind of grounds , it was that {disfmarker} that , uh , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available . Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter , but it {disfmarker} it matters more in some situations than in others , and it {disfmarker} and also there 's {disfmarker} there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways . I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using , or you care , you know , what recall time is ,
Turn 1063, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 1064, C (Professor): or you care , you know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 1065, E (Grad): Or you only have a million words {pause} for your {disfmarker} some new task .
Turn 1066, C (Professor): Yeah , or {disfmarker} or , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1067, D (PhD): Or done another language , or {disfmarker} I mean , you {disfmarker} so there 's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah - blah - blah ,
Turn 1068, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1069, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1070, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 1071, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1072, D (PhD): and then there 's people saying , " Oh , just add more data . "
Turn 1073, C (Professor): And there 's cost !
Turn 1074, D (PhD): So , these are like two different religions , basically .
Turn 1075, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Cost .
Turn 1076, C (Professor): There 's just plain cost ,
Turn 1077, E (Grad): Yeah . That 's a big one .
Turn 1078, C (Professor): you know , so {disfmarker} so these , I mean th the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred , and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter , that 's {disfmarker} that 's gonna be better . because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on
Turn 1079, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1080, C (Professor): and then that 's it for the r for all of time . I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things matters {disfmarker} matter .
Turn 1081, A (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's it .
Turn 1082, E (Grad): Yeah , so that 's one of the slides they put up .
Turn 1083, A (Postdoc): So , I mean , this was a very provocative slide . She put this up , and it was like this is {disfmarker} this p people kept saying , " Can I see that slide again ? "
Turn 1084, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1085, D (PhD): Yeah ,
Turn 1086, A (Postdoc): and then they 'd make a comment , and one person said , well - known person said , um , you know , " Before you dismiss forty - five years including my work {disfmarker} "
Turn 1087, D (PhD): yeah .
Turn 1088, E (Grad): Forty - five years of research .
Turn 1089, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1090, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1091, D (PhD): But th you know , the same thing has happened in computational linguistics , right ? You look at the ACL papers coming out , and now there 's sort of a turn back towards , OK we 've learned statistic {disfmarker} you know , we 're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods , and , you know , the there 's arguments on both sides ,
Turn 1092, E (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1093, D (PhD): so {disfmarker}
Turn 1094, E (Grad): I think the matters is the thing that {disfmarker} that was misleading .
Turn 1095, A (Postdoc): That was very offending , very offending .
Turn 1096, D (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1097, E (Grad): Is that {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} all of them are based on all the others , right ? Just , you {disfmarker} you can't say {disfmarker}
Turn 1098, B (PhD): Maybe they should have said " focus " or something .
Turn 1099, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1100, E (Grad): Yeah . I mean , so . {disfmarker} And I 'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition , right ? For a long time people were hand - c coding linguistic rules and then they discovered machine - learning worked better . And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying {disfmarker} perhaps worrying less and less about , uh , the exact details of the algorithms .
Turn 1101, D (PhD): And {disfmarker} and then you hit this {disfmarker}
Turn 1102, E (Grad): Except when they have a Eurospeech paper .
Turn 1103, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1104, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1105, E (Grad): Anyway .
Turn 1106, C (Professor): Anyway , tea is {disfmarker} tea is , uh , starting .
Turn 1107, E (Grad): Shall we read some digits ? Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again .
Turn 1108, C (Professor): Let 's do it all at once .
Turn 1109, A (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's good .
Turn 1110, C (Professor): We {disfmarker} @ @ {disfmarker} let 's try that again .
Turn 1111, D (PhD): Yes ! So , and maybe we won't laugh this time also .
Turn 1112, E (Grad): OK . So remember to read the transcript number so that , uh , everyone knows that {disfmarker} what it is . And ready ?
Turn 1113, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1114, E (Grad): Three , two , one .
Turn 1115, C (Professor): Boy , is that ever efficient .
Turn 1116, E (Grad): Yep . That 's really fast .
Turn 1117, C (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
