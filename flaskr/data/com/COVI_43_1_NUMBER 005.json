While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history.\n              Today's meeting is taking place by video conference. The proceedings will be made available via the House of Commons website. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings.\n              \n              In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. The video conference will be interpreted as in normal meetings of committees and in the House.\n              In the lower part of your screen, you can choose the language: floor, English or French. Please wait until I call on you by name before you begin to speak. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie.\n              \n              Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. \n              Please direct your remarks through the chair. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order.\n              \n              If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the “raised hand” function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. To do this, click on the “participant” button at the bottom of your screen. When the list appears, you will see the raised hand option beside your name.\n              Speak slowly and clearly at all times. When you are not speaking, leave your microphone on mute. It is highly recommended that you use a headset with a microphone.\n              \n              You have to remember to switch languages.\n              Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. Please note that we may need to suspend during these times in order to correct a problem.\n               I want to remind the honourable members to mute their microphones when they are not speaking.\n              If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. If you are unable to rejoin, please contact our technical support team.\n              Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views.

You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. \n              I understand there are no ministerial announcements today. \n              We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.\n               I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. the day before.\n              Now we'll go to presenting petitions.\n              Mr. Genuis."}, {"turn": 2, "speakerID": "261646", "name": "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, CPC)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. It also included a five-year review.\n              Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. I commend that petition to the consideration of the House. \n              The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well.\n              Canada can and should take action on this. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "We will go to Ms. May."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "261727", "name": "Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich—Gulf Islands, GP)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

It's not just members of the opposition saying it.\n              This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Six stakeholders from different sectors sounded the alarm.\n              Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry?"}, {"turn": 243, "speakerID": "261558", "name": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "contribution": "We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way.\n              I'd like to correct my fellow member. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability.\n              Here's an example. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability."}, {"turn": 244, "speakerID": "261764", "name": "Mr. Yves Perron", "contribution": "Now it's my turn to correct the minister. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. We are in a crisis, and this is an exceptional situation. In the case of mad cow disease, farmers received direct assistance. That's the kind of assistance we are calling for. We don't want to hear about growing levels of debt. Of course, this is a first step, but farms are already deep in debt.\n              A few days ago, the government announced $50 million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20 per hog for 27 million hogs. The government's support covers just 2.5 million hogs. When I call the measure insufficient, I mean it is grossly insufficient. It's high time the government put forth more support. It has to stop saying that it's working hard and examining the situation. The government has to listen to the people in the industry. Again, this morning, they had some interesting proposals.\n              When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for."}, {"turn": 245, "speakerID": "261558", "name": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "contribution": "We are going step by step. The programs are already in place. We are trying to make them better, and we are committed to doing that. These programs are cost-shared with the provinces. \n              However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. We are moving forward in every province to help pork and beef producers. That's two funding envelopes of $50 million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. That's new money that was not yet available, money we introduced this week. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step."}, {"turn": 246, "speakerID": "261764", "name": "Mr. Yves Perron", "contribution": "What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125 million is not new money. It was already earmarked for the programs. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Something doesn't add up there.\n              What's more, there are different ways to make money available. I'd like to talk compensation. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. That resulted in additional losses, once again. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements.\n              Can we expect the government to announce measures in the coming days?"}, {"turn": 247, "speakerID": "261558", "name": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "contribution": "Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectors—meaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmers—is as strong as it always was. I repeat, our commitment is clear.\n              Dairy producers received their first payment at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery.\n              At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n              When it comes to the dairy sector, I hope I can count on your support. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200 million so it can buy more butter and cheese."}, {"turn": 248, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Our next question will go to Mr. Lake."}, {"turn": 249, "speakerID": "261690", "name": "Hon. Mike Lake (Edmonton—Wetaskiwin, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n              Mr. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. On March 16, Dr. Tedros said in his briefing, “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, “Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictions—they’re also the best way to prevent them.”\n              Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada?"}, {"turn": 250, "speakerID": "261656", "name": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "contribution": "Thanks to the member for the very astute observation and question.\n              Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world.\n              Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more."}, {"turn": 251, "speakerID": "261690", "name": "Hon.

Mike Lake", "contribution": "I'll save you the time. The exact number was 28,851, on average, every day last week. That's a gap of 30,000 from what your stated testing capability is. \n              I'll give another quote from Dr. Tam, back on April 22, 15 days ago. She said, “As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already.”\n              Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement?"}, {"turn": 256, "speakerID": "261656", "name": "Hon.

I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. I'm happy to have a conversation with the member later about that testing strategy. \n              Dr. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. We, as the federal government, provide the capacity for them to conduct those tests."}, {"turn": 257, "speakerID": "261690", "name": "Hon.

Patty Hajdu", "contribution": "Each province and territory has its own outbreak and its own epidemic.

We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology.
