So you should , definitely ."}, {"contribution": " Um , so {disfmarker} so it definitely had that as a concept . So tha it has a single time - line ,"}, {"contribution": " Mm - hmm ."}, {"contribution": " and then you can have lots of different sections , each of which have I Ds attached to it , and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds , if you want to .

So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time . We don't know when it ends ."}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " Right ?

Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss ."}, {"contribution": " Right , OK . I would say {disfmarker} OK , so frame - level is probably not a good idea . But for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " And th it 's {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Like phones , or syllables , or anything like that ."}, {"contribution": " Phones are every five frames though , so . Or something like that ."}, {"contribution": " But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but most of the frames are actually not speech . So , you know , people don't {disfmarker} v Look at it , words times the average {disfmarker} The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , {comment} five maybe ?"}, {"contribution": " Yeah , but we actually {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " So , look at it , t number of words times five . That 's not {disfmarker} that not {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the {disfmarker} long pause phones ."}, {"contribution": " Exactly ."}, {"contribution": " Yep ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah . OK . That 's true . But you do have to keep them in there . Y yeah ."}, {"contribution": " So I think it {disfmarker} it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing ."}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " But I think , a anything at frame - level , even P - file , is too verbose ."}, {"contribution": " OK . So {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " I would use something tighter than P - files ."}, {"contribution": " Do you {disfmarker} Are you familiar with it ?"}, {"contribution": " So ."}, {"contribution": " I haven't seen this particular format ,"}, {"contribution": " I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I 've used them ."}, {"contribution": " but {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " I don't know what their structure is ."}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " I 've forgot what the str"}, {"contribution": " But , wait a minute , P - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values ,"}, {"contribution": " It 's whatever you want , actually ."}, {"contribution": " right ? Right ."}, {"contribution": " So that {disfmarker} what 's nice about the P - file {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} i Built into it is the concept of {pause} frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure .

And it can take different types ."}, {"contribution": " Oh ."}, {"contribution": " So it {disfmarker} th they don't all have to be floats . You know , you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that sort of stuff ."}, {"contribution": " So that {disfmarker} that sounds {disfmarker} that sounds about what I w"}, {"contribution": " Um . Right ? And it has a header {disfmarker} it has a header format that {pause} describes it {pause} to some extent . So , the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the {pause} utterance numbers and the {pause} frame numbers in the file , even though they 're always sequential . And so it does waste a lot of space ."}, {"contribution": " Hmm ."}, {"contribution": " But it 's still a lot tighter than {disfmarker} than ASCII .

Man - pages and , uh , source code , and me ."}, {"contribution": " OK , great . So , I mean , that sounds good . I {disfmarker} I was just looking for something {disfmarker} I 'm not a database person , but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out , other people can work on it ,"}, {"contribution": " Yeah , it 's not standard ."}, {"contribution": " or {disfmarker} {comment} Is it {disfmarker} ?"}, {"contribution": " I mean , it 's something that we developed at ICSI . But , uh {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " But it 's {pause} been used here"}, {"contribution": " But it 's been used here"}, {"contribution": " and people 've {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " and {disfmarker} and , you know , we have a {pause} well - configured system that you can distribute for free , and {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " I mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ?"}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah , th we have {disfmarker} Actually , we {disfmarker} we use a generalization of the {disfmarker} the Sphere format ."}, {"contribution": " Mmm ."}, {"contribution": " Um , but {disfmarker} Yeah , so there is something like that but it 's , um , probably not as sophist"}, {"contribution": " Well , what does H T K do for features ?"}, {"contribution": " And I think there 's {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Or does it even have a concept of features ?"}, {"contribution": " They ha it has its own {disfmarker} I mean , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ?"}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " Hmm ?"}, {"contribution": " Yeah . Th - this is exactly the kind of decision {disfmarker} It 's just whatever {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " But , I mean , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ?"}, {"contribution": " Right ."}, {"contribution": " They generate their own ."}, {"contribution": " I mean {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " Actually , I {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we 've done this stuff on prosodics and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files , and we just have an ASCII , uh , output of frame - by - frame ."}, {"contribution": " Ah , right ."}, {"contribution": " Which is fine , but it gets unwieldy to go in and {disfmarker} and query these files with really huge files ."}, {"contribution": " Right ."}, {"contribution": " I mean , we could do it . I was just thinking if there 's something that {disfmarker} where all the frame values are {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " And a and again , if you have a {disfmarker} if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Hmm ? They 're {disfmarker} they 're fair they 're quite large ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah , I mean , they 'd be emo enormous ."}, {"contribution": " And these are for ten - minute Switchboard conversations ,"}, {"contribution": " Right ."}, {"contribution": " and {disfmarker} So it 's doable , it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame and it doesn't have any kind of ,"}, {"contribution": " Is {disfmarker} is the sharing part of this a pretty important {pause} consideration"}, {"contribution": " um {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " or does that just sort of , uh {disfmarker} a nice thing to have ?"}, {"contribution": " I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data .

Um , it doesn't have to be pretty , it just has to be , you know , easy to use , and {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Yeah , the other thing {disfmarker} We should look at ATLAS , the NIST thing ,"}, {"contribution": " Oh ."}, {"contribution": " Mmm ."}, {"contribution": " and see if they have anything at that level ."}, {"contribution": " Uh {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " I mean , I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS , because they chose a different route . I chose something that {disfmarker} Th - there are sort of two choices . Your {disfmarker} your file format can know about {disfmarker} know that you 're talking about language {pause} and speech , which is what I chose , and time , or your file format can just be a graph representation . And then the application has to impose the structure on top . So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way , which was their file format is just nodes and links , and you have to interpret what they mean yourself ."}, {"contribution": " And why did you not choose that type of approach ?"}, {"contribution": " Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech , and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be {disfmarker} t for the tags to say \" it 's an utterance \" , as opposed to the tag to say \" it 's a link \" ."}, {"contribution": " OK . OK ."}, {"contribution": " So , but {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " But other than that , are they compatible ? I mean , you could sort of {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Yeah , they 're reasonably compatible ."}, {"contribution": " I mean , you {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " You could probably translate between them ."}, {"contribution": " Yep ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah , that 's w So ,"}, {"contribution": " So , well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it ."}, {"contribution": " OK . I don't {disfmarker} So this is what the meeting 's about ,"}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " just sort of how to {disfmarker} Um , cuz we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work . And I actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " So maybe it 's {disfmarker} maybe oth you know , if {disfmarker} if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't ."}, {"contribution": " The only thing {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " Do they already have tools ?"}, {"contribution": " I mean , I {disfmarker} I chose this for a couple reasons . One of them is that it 's easy to parse . You don't need a full XML parser . It 's very easy to just write a Perl script {pause} to parse it ."}, {"contribution": " As long as uh each tag is on one line ."}, {"contribution": " Exactly . Exactly . Which I always do ."}, {"contribution": " And you can have as much information in the tag as you want , right ?"}, {"contribution": " Well , I have it structured . Right ? So each type tag has only particular items that it can take ."}, {"contribution": " Can you {disfmarker} But you can add to those structures if you {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " Sure . If you have more information . So what {disfmarker} What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like \" link {nonvocalsound} start equals , um , you know , some node ID ,"}, {"contribution": " Yeah . So {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " end equals some other node ID \" , and then \" type \" would be \" utterance \" ."}, {"contribution": " Hmm ."}, {"contribution": " You know , so it 's very similar ."}, {"contribution": " So why would it be a {disfmarker} a waste to do it this way if it 's similar enough that we can always translate it ?"}, {"contribution": " It probably wouldn't be a waste . It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything ."}, {"contribution": " Write a translator .

And so , specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time . They just had the sort of conceptual {pause} node {disfmarker} uh , annotated transcription graph , which I really liked . And that 's exactly what this stuff is based on .

Maybe I should ."}, {"contribution": " We should {disfmarker} we should find out ."}, {"contribution": " I mean , would the tools {disfmarker} would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ?"}, {"contribution": " Um , th what would {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail"}, {"contribution": " It 's a hassle"}, {"contribution": " I mean , that {disfmarker} I guess it 's a question that {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " if {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " uh , yeah ."}, {"contribution": " that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other ."}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " I {disfmarker} I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , I mean , {vocalsound} it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that {disfmarker}"}, {"contribution": " OK ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah , we might as well . Yep ."}, {"contribution": " Yeah ."}, {"contribution": " So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll take a closer look at it ."}, {"contribution": " Actually , so it 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that would really be the question , is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing ."}, {"contribution": " And {disfmarker} Right ."}, {"contribution": " Cuz {vocalsound} once we start , sort of , doing this I don't {disfmarker} we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again"}, {"contribution": " The {disfmarker} Yep .
