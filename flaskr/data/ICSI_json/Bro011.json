Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike ."}, {"turn": 142, "name": "Grad", "id": "F", "contribution": " Hmm ."}, {"turn": 143, "name": "PhD", "id": "B", "contribution": " Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?"}, {"turn": 144, "name": "Professor", "id": "A", "contribution": " Yes ."}, {"turn": 145, "name": "PhD", "id": "B", "contribution": " Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,"}, {"turn": 146, "name": "Professor", "id": "A", "contribution": " Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah ."}, {"turn": 147, "name": "PhD", "id": "B", "contribution": " and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words ."}, {"turn": 148, "name": "Professor", "id": "A", "contribution": " Yeah .
