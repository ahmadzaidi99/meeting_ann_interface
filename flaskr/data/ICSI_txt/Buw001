Turn 0, G (Grad): headphones that aren't so uncomfortable .
Turn 1, B (PhD): I think {disfmarker} Well , this should be off the record ,
Turn 2, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 3, B (PhD): but I think {disfmarker}
Turn 4, D (Professor): Uh , OK .
Turn 5, A (Professor): We 're not recording yet , are we ?
Turn 6, G (Grad): Well , I don't think {disfmarker}
Turn 7, F (PhD): No , uh , that {disfmarker} that wasn't recorded .
Turn 8, G (Grad): No . Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears .
Turn 9, B (PhD): Yeah , I know . It just {disfmarker} it really hurts . It gives you a headache , like if you {disfmarker} On your temple {disfmarker}
Turn 10, F (PhD): Temple squeezers .
Turn 11, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 12, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 13, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 14, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 15, G (Grad): But I definitely {pause} haven't figured it out .
Turn 16, A (Professor): Um , Meeting Recorder meeting .
Turn 17, F (PhD): I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something .
Turn 18, B (PhD): Yeah , with the {disfmarker} We kno I know .
Turn 19, G (Grad): " Sip , sigh . "
Turn 20, B (PhD): We know exactly how much you have left in your cup .
Turn 21, F (PhD): I was just noticing a big s
Turn 22, D (Professor): So are we recording now ? Is this {disfmarker}
Turn 23, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 24, D (Professor): Oh ! We 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're live . OK .
Turn 25, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 26, D (Professor): So , uh , {vocalsound} what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said {disfmarker} we said data collection , which we 're doing .
Turn 27, B (PhD): Were we gonna do digits ?
Turn 28, A (Professor): OK . Do we do th do you go around the room {pause} and do names or anything ?
Turn 29, G (Grad): I think that {disfmarker}
Turn 30, E (PhD): It 's a good idea .
Turn 31, G (Grad): u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . So . Besides with this big a group ,
Turn 32, B (PhD): You can write them on the board , if you want .
Turn 33, D (Professor): No . I it 'd be even better with this big {disfmarker}
Turn 34, G (Grad): it would take too much time .
Turn 35, E (PhD): Which way is {disfmarker}
Turn 36, G (Grad): Yeah , but it takes too much time .
Turn 37, E (PhD): Mari ?
Turn 38, H (Postdoc): What {disfmarker}
Turn 39, A (Professor): What ?
Turn 40, D (Professor): It 's not that long .
Turn 41, E (PhD): Y I think your {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} your thing {nonvocalsound} may be pointing in a funny direction . Sort of it 's {disfmarker} it helps if it points sort of upwards .
Turn 42, A (Professor): Whoops .
Turn 43, E (PhD): Sort of it {disfmarker} you know .
Turn 44, A (Professor): Would it {disfmarker} m
Turn 45, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 46, D (Professor): w u
Turn 47, E (PhD): So that thing {disfmarker} the little {disfmarker} th that part should be pointing upwards .
Turn 48, A (Professor): So {disfmarker} Oh , this thing .
Turn 49, E (PhD): That 's it . Yeah .
Turn 50, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 51, H (Postdoc): Otherwise you just get a heartbeats .
Turn 52, A (Professor): It 's kind of {disfmarker}
Turn 53, D (Professor): Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you {disfmarker} your mouth as possible .
Turn 54, A (Professor): Yeah . OK .
Turn 55, E (PhD): That 's good . That kind of thing is good .
Turn 56, H (Postdoc): It 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 57, A (Professor): This w Alright .
Turn 58, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 59, A (Professor): How 's that working ?
Turn 60, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 61, E (PhD): Oh , yeah . It 's a {disfmarker} It 's working .
Turn 62, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 63, D (Professor): Alright . So what we had {pause} was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , um , uh , you {disfmarker} you put up there data format ,
Turn 64, A (Professor): Um .
Turn 65, D (Professor): and other tasks during data collection ,
Turn 66, A (Professor): So , I think the goal {disfmarker} the goal was what can we do {disfmarker} how can you do the data collection differently to get {disfmarker}
Turn 67, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 68, A (Professor): what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like {disfmarker}
Turn 69, G (Grad): Uh , especially for querying .
Turn 70, A (Professor): Especially for querying . So , getting people to do queries afterwards , getting people to do summaries afterwards . Um .
Turn 71, H (Postdoc): Well , one thing that came up in the morning {disfmarker} in the morning was the , um , i uh , if he {disfmarker} I , um {disfmarker} if he has {disfmarker} s I {disfmarker} I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ?
Turn 72, G (Grad): Landay . James .
Turn 73, H (Postdoc): La - Landay ? So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk {comment} note - taking things ,
Turn 74, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 75, H (Postdoc): then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . y if {disfmarker} if we were able to {disfmarker} to do that .
Turn 76, A (Professor): Well , if {disfmarker} if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah .
Turn 77, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 78, A (Professor): So that wouldn't be a summary . That would just be {disfmarker} that would b relate to the query side .
Turn 79, G (Grad): But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if {disfmarker} if something comes up {vocalsound} write it down and mark it {vocalsound} {pause} somehow ,
Turn 80, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 81, E (PhD): Right . I mean , we {disfmarker} because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things .
Turn 82, G (Grad): you know .
Turn 83, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 84, E (PhD): I mean , cuz I tend to take notes which are summaries . And so , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 85, F (PhD): I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of {vocalsound} the handwriting recognition was quite poor .
Turn 86, A (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 87, G (Grad): But that 's alright . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up
Turn 88, A (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 89, G (Grad): pretty easily .
Turn 90, A (Professor): Yeah . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that {disfmarker} for frequent things .
Turn 91, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 92, A (Professor): And the other things , people can write whatever they want . I mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit . So , if that {disfmarker} you know , if {disfmarker} if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .
Turn 93, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 94, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 95, D (Professor): I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were .
Turn 96, H (Postdoc): The roll call .
Turn 97, A (Professor): Right . I thought you did that on purpose .
Turn 98, D (Professor): Roll call .
Turn 99, A (Professor): But anyway , shall we do the roll call ?
Turn 100, D (Professor): No , not a No , I just {disfmarker} My mind went elsewhere . So , uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three .
Turn 101, G (Grad): And I 'm Adam Janin on channel A .
Turn 102, H (Postdoc): I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B .
Turn 103, E (PhD): I 'm Dan Ellis .
Turn 104, F (PhD): Eric on channel nine .
Turn 105, B (PhD): Liz , on channel one .
Turn 106, A (Professor): Mari on channel zero .
Turn 107, C (Professor): Katrin on channel two .
Turn 108, H (Postdoc): Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . {vocalsound} No .
Turn 109, D (Professor): I 'm Rocky Raccoon {vocalsound} on channel {disfmarker}
Turn 110, E (PhD): Let me , uh , turn that off .
Turn 111, G (Grad): And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the {pause} P Z
Turn 112, E (PhD): Oh . PZM nearest , nearest , next nearest . Next one .
Turn 113, H (Postdoc): Next nearest .
Turn 114, E (PhD): Furthest .
Turn 115, G (Grad): Far .
Turn 116, E (PhD): PDM - right , PZA - right {disfmarker} PDA - right , PDA - left .
Turn 117, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 118, E (PhD): Thanks .
Turn 119, G (Grad): Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets {comment} will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . You know , probably with double - sided tape , but {disfmarker} So . You {disfmarker} So we won't have to go through that .
Turn 120, A (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 121, H (Postdoc): I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How {disfmarker} how do we get {disfmarker} Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet {disfmarker} I mean , the box that contains the {disfmarker}
Turn 122, D (Professor): Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column {disfmarker} common {comment} that we will not know .
Turn 123, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 124, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 125, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 126, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 127, A (Professor): So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .
Turn 128, H (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 129, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 130, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 131, D (Professor): I mean , we {disfmarker} we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be {vocalsound} jargon to {disfmarker} to us . So .
Turn 132, G (Grad): Well , that was just one of the reasons . But , yeah , definitely .
Turn 133, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 134, H (Postdoc): OK . Good .
Turn 135, D (Professor): That {disfmarker} that 's right . There were others of course . Yeah .
Turn 136, H (Postdoc): OK , so we were on the data collection {pause} {comment} and the summary issue .
Turn 137, D (Professor): Right . We can go back .
Turn 138, A (Professor): So , uh , u u So , actually there 's kind of three issues . There 's the CrossPad issue . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ? Um , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that {disfmarker}
Turn 139, F (PhD): There 's {disfmarker} there 're sub - problems in that , in that where {disfmarker} or when do you actually ask them about that ?
Turn 140, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 141, F (PhD): I mean , that was {disfmarker} One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then .
Turn 142, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 143, F (PhD): But there 's a problem with that in that if {pause} you 're not {disfmarker} If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question .
Turn 144, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 145, F (PhD): Right . And furth id explore the data further .
Turn 146, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 147, F (PhD): So .
Turn 148, D (Professor): There 's {disfmarker} there 's another problem
Turn 149, G (Grad): And {disfmarker}
Turn 150, D (Professor): which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we did n you know another meeting here for another group and {disfmarker} and , uh , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} have to come up with , uh , the summar "
Turn 151, G (Grad): Well , I asked them to and none of them did .
Turn 152, D (Professor): t See ? There we go .
Turn 153, G (Grad): So , I {disfmarker} I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting
Turn 154, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 155, A (Professor): They {disfmarker}
Turn 156, G (Grad): and no one ever did .
Turn 157, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 158, G (Grad): I didn't follow up either .
Turn 159, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 160, G (Grad): So I didn't track them down and say " please do th do it now " . But , uh , no one spontaneously provided anything .
Turn 161, D (Professor): I I 'm worried that if you did {disfmarker} even if you did push them into it , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it might be semi - random ,
Turn 162, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 163, D (Professor): uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing .
Turn 164, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 165, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 166, G (Grad): I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important , that might be a query " .
Turn 167, H (Postdoc): Tsk . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , " action item " and things like that , which could be used in , uh , t to some degree finding the structure .
Turn 168, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 169, E (PhD): Although {disfmarker}
Turn 170, A (Professor): W
Turn 171, H (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , um , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary .
Turn 172, A (Professor): How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .
Turn 173, H (Postdoc): Yeah , good . Good point .
Turn 174, A (Professor): And {disfmarker} So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?
Turn 175, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 176, G (Grad): I mean , that gives you a summary but it doesn't really {disfmarker} How do you generate queries from that ?
Turn 177, E (PhD): Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system .
Turn 178, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 179, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 180, E (PhD): Right ? I mean , they 're something . It 's a {disfmarker} a kind of output you 'd like .
Turn 181, B (PhD): Actually {disfmarker} And so {disfmarker}
Turn 182, G (Grad): Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis .
Turn 183, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 184, G (Grad): I 'm gonna do something . I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me .
Turn 185, D (Professor): Well , I think that we {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings
Turn 186, A (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 187, D (Professor): and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed
Turn 188, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 189, D (Professor): or need some other {disfmarker} And then we 'll have some data there .
Turn 190, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 191, D (Professor): And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and {disfmarker} at the very least .
Turn 192, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 193, A (Professor): Yeah {disfmarker}
Turn 194, B (PhD): I actually want to say something about the note pad . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to {pause} be using that for other purposes , {comment} and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff {comment} plot of wh you know , who 's writing when .
Turn 195, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 196, B (PhD): That 's all you {disfmarker}
Turn 197, E (PhD): Activity . Yeah .
Turn 198, B (PhD): And , you can also have notes of the meeting . But I bet that 's {disfmarker} that will allow you to go into the {disfmarker} sort of the hot places where people are writing things down .
Turn 199, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 200, G (Grad): Oh , I see .
Turn 201, B (PhD): I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said .
Turn 202, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 203, B (PhD): It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important .
Turn 204, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 205, B (PhD): And that wouldn't take any extra {disfmarker}
Turn 206, H (Postdoc): That 's a nice idea .
Turn 207, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 208, B (PhD): Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad
Turn 209, D (Professor): It {disfmarker}
Turn 210, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 211, B (PhD): and go like that if you want to . It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 212, D (Professor): That 's a good idea but that doesn't {disfmarker} Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?
Turn 213, A (Professor): Well , what it does {disfmarker}
Turn 214, B (PhD): Well , then you can go to the points where the {disfmarker} you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . And you r
Turn 215, A (Professor): Well , what it does is provide a different {disfmarker}
Turn 216, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 217, B (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 218, G (Grad): Uh , y
Turn 219, A (Professor): I {disfmarker} I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the {disfmarker} the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? "
Turn 220, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 221, D (Professor): That {disfmarker} that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of , um , " how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? " , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking .
Turn 222, B (PhD): But I bet it 's a good {pause} superset of it .
Turn 223, D (Professor): Does it ?
Turn 224, A (Professor): Well , yeah .
Turn 225, E (PhD): Well , see , there are th
Turn 226, A (Professor): I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when {disfmarker} uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . And at least that gives you the word {pause} that they might run a query on .
Turn 227, B (PhD): At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords
Turn 228, D (Professor): Maybe .
Turn 229, G (Grad): I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is ,
Turn 230, B (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 231, G (Grad): not what the query is .
Turn 232, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 233, B (PhD): Right , right .
Turn 234, G (Grad): What {disfmarker}
Turn 235, A (Professor): It 'll tell you the hit but not the query .
Turn 236, B (PhD): But I think {disfmarker} I think thinking about queries is a little bit dangerous right now .
Turn 237, G (Grad): And so you could {disfmarker} you can generate a query from the hits ,
Turn 238, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 239, G (Grad): but {disfmarker}
Turn 240, B (PhD): We don't even know what {disfmarker} I mean , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user ,
Turn 241, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 242, B (PhD): but I mean a different domain and a different user {disfmarker}
Turn 243, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 244, D (Professor): Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that
Turn 245, B (PhD): Um .
Turn 246, D (Professor): because , you know , th what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} i We {disfmarker} we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of queries . So he 's just sort of going " where {disfmarker} where do I {disfmarker} where do I start ? "
Turn 247, A (Professor): w Well , th you could do {disfmarker} I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,
Turn 248, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 249, A (Professor): for a couple reasons . One , if you have a summary {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings .
Turn 250, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 251, A (Professor): So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .
Turn 252, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 253, A (Professor): Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? "
Turn 254, G (Grad): Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary .
Turn 255, A (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 256, G (Grad): But , I think it would give {disfmarker}
Turn 257, A (Professor): That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,
Turn 258, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 259, A (Professor): and you want to ask questions to get more detail .
Turn 260, G (Grad): th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . Well , it doesn't have to be . OK . So that {disfmarker} that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a {pause} remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , uh , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . But it 's not {disfmarker}
Turn 261, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 262, G (Grad): I don't know how to do it if {disfmarker} until you have a system .
Turn 263, B (PhD): The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then .
Turn 264, A (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 265, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 266, B (PhD): I mean , your research is going to be very circular .
Turn 267, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 268, G (Grad): Yeah , that {disfmarker} that 's what I was saying .
Turn 269, E (PhD): But th there is this , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? " And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you {disfmarker}
Turn 270, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 271, E (PhD): And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for .
Turn 272, A (Professor): Right . Right .
Turn 273, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 274, E (PhD): Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So , I mean {disfmarker} And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just {disfmarker} until they actually occur .
Turn 275, B (PhD): But you could always post - hoc label them .
Turn 276, E (PhD): You know , it 's like {disfmarker} Right , right . Exactly .
Turn 277, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 278, E (PhD): But I mean , it 's difficult to sort of say " and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? " Those aren't the kind of things that come up .
Turn 279, G (Grad): But at least it would get us started .
Turn 280, E (PhD): Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure .
Turn 281, H (Postdoc): I also think that w if {disfmarker} if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the {disfmarker} of the meeting , then you might get something like {disfmarker} y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " . And , you know {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and maybe you could get to it by that . If you {disfmarker} if you had the {disfmarker} the larger structure of the {disfmarker} of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that .
Turn 282, G (Grad): Mmm . Although it seems like that 's , um , a high burden on the note - taker .
Turn 283, H (Postdoc): I think that {disfmarker}
Turn 284, G (Grad): That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take .
Turn 285, B (PhD): Maybe Landay can put a student in to be a note - taker .
Turn 286, A (Professor): I th No . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or {disfmarker} you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker .
Turn 287, B (PhD): No ?
Turn 288, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 289, A (Professor): Somebody who 's part of the meeting .
Turn 290, B (PhD): No , I mean , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker {disfmarker}
Turn 291, G (Grad): But they {disfmarker}
Turn 292, B (PhD): And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research . I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system ,
Turn 293, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 294, B (PhD): because that that 's a lot of trouble
Turn 295, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 296, B (PhD): and maybe it 's not the best way to do it . But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings ,
Turn 297, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 298, B (PhD): and get the notes from the note - taker or something .
Turn 299, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 300, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 301, G (Grad): Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem . Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it .
Turn 302, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 303, G (Grad): I think they 're done . Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes . So what we 'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech .
Turn 304, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 305, G (Grad): And so the question is " is there such a person ? " And I think right now , the answer is " no " .
Turn 306, A (Professor): Well
Turn 307, D (Professor): I 've b been thinking {disfmarker}
Turn 308, G (Grad): We 'll just have to see .
Turn 309, D (Professor): I 've been thinking about it a little bit here {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} uh , th this , e um {disfmarker} I think that the {disfmarker} now I 'm thinking that the summary {disfmarker} a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this {disfmarker} into what we 'd like to get at . It 's {disfmarker} it 's not ideal , but we {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we have to get started someplace . So I was {disfmarker} I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get {disfmarker} w We have this collection of meeting . We have five hours of stuff . Uh , we get that transcribed . So now we have five hours of meetings and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? " Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . I 'd have to get started someplace . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , um , what was the part that {disfmarker} " And {disfmarker} and th I think that might then help me to think of things {disfmarker} even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .
Turn 310, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 311, A (Professor): I think it serves two purpo purposes . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,
Turn 312, D (Professor): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 313, A (Professor): but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries . And then it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's kind of a key .
Turn 314, D (Professor): Well , yeah . That 's true too .
Turn 315, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 316, G (Grad): Yeah , absolutely . Then you want to have it .
Turn 317, A (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 318, B (PhD): So how does the summary get generated ?
Turn 319, A (Professor): Well , i i {disfmarker} ?
Turn 320, B (PhD): I 'm not against the idea of a summary ,
Turn 321, G (Grad): By hand .
Turn 322, B (PhD): but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it
Turn 323, A (Professor): Or , d o
Turn 324, B (PhD): and how {disfmarker} because the summary will drive the queries .
Turn 325, A (Professor): What I {disfmarker} I think , you know , in most meetings ,
Turn 326, B (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 327, A (Professor): this one being {pause} different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop {disfmarker} Um , you can just make it be on a laptop ,
Turn 328, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 329, A (Professor): so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody {disfmarker} you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary and they email it out for minutes . I mean , that happens in most meetings .
Turn 330, H (Postdoc): I I {disfmarker} I think that , um , there 's {disfmarker} we 're using " summary " in two different ways . So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " .
Turn 331, G (Grad): Minutes .
Turn 332, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 333, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 334, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 335, H (Postdoc): And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? "
Turn 336, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 337, A (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 338, H (Postdoc): And then they would say " well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about {disfmarker} " And then you 'd have , like {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that {disfmarker}
Turn 339, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 340, H (Postdoc): Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , uh , with mult See , I {disfmarker} I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , um , you know , it {disfmarker} it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting ,
Turn 341, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 342, H (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and people have different {comment} major topics that they 're interested in .
Turn 343, D (Professor): A
Turn 344, H (Postdoc): So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards ,
Turn 345, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 346, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 347, H (Postdoc): no longer than two minutes ,
Turn 348, D (Professor): Adam , you can {disfmarker}
Turn 349, H (Postdoc): from multiple people .
Turn 350, D (Professor): you can correct me on this ,
Turn 351, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 352, D (Professor): but {disfmarker} but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop
Turn 353, G (Grad): Never .
Turn 354, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 355, G (Grad): Never . I 've never seen it at ICSI . Does anyone {disfmarker} ?
Turn 356, B (PhD): Dan ?
Turn 357, D (Professor): I
Turn 358, G (Grad): I mean , Dan is the one who {disfmarker} who most frequently would take notes ,
Turn 359, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 360, G (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 361, E (PhD): I 've d When we {disfmarker} when we have other meetings . When I have meetings on the European projects , we have someone taking notes .
Turn 362, G (Grad): Oh , really ?
Turn 363, D (Professor): Yeah , but those are bigger deal things .
Turn 364, E (PhD): In fact , I often do it .
Turn 365, D (Professor): Right ? Where you 've got fifteen peo
Turn 366, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 367, D (Professor): I mean , most {disfmarker} th this is one of the larger meetings . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people
Turn 368, G (Grad): That 's true {disfmarker} are four or five people .
Turn 369, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 370, D (Professor): and you 're not {disfmarker} you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it .
Turn 371, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 372, D (Professor): You just {vocalsound} get together and talk about where you are .
Turn 373, A (Professor): So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion .
Turn 374, G (Grad): Culture .
Turn 375, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 376, A (Professor): And I agree ,
Turn 377, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 378, A (Professor): technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes .
Turn 379, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 380, G (Grad): The IRAM meeting , they {disfmarker} they take notes every {disfmarker}
Turn 381, D (Professor): Do they ?
Turn 382, G (Grad): There 's uh a person with a laptop {pause} at each meeting .
Turn 383, E (PhD): How many people are those meetings ?
Turn 384, G (Grad): There are more . I mean , there are ten - ish .
Turn 385, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 386, B (PhD): Y you should also have a record of what 's on the board .
Turn 387, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 388, G (Grad): They 're very sparse .
Turn 389, B (PhD): I mean , I find it very {pause} hard to reconstruct what 's going on . I {disfmarker} I don't know how {disfmarker}
Turn 390, G (Grad): Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about .
Turn 391, B (PhD): I don't know how , but for instance , I mean , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . And if you have a {disfmarker} Or you shou could tell people not to {disfmarker} to use the boards . But there 's sort of this missing information otherwise .
Turn 392, E (PhD): We sh we should {disfmarker}
Turn 393, G (Grad): I agree , but {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} you just {disfmarker} you g end up with video ,
Turn 394, H (Postdoc): I agree .
Turn 395, E (PhD): Well , I don't know .
Turn 396, G (Grad): and {disfmarker} and instrumented rooms . And {pause} that 's a different project , I think .
Turn 397, E (PhD): f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera
Turn 398, G (Grad): Yeah , different {disfmarker}
Turn 399, B (PhD): Uh , y
Turn 400, E (PhD): just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . You know , like three or four snaps for every {disfmarker}
Turn 401, B (PhD): Right .
Turn 402, H (Postdoc): I agree .
Turn 403, B (PhD): Yeah . People who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise .
Turn 404, E (PhD): for every meeting .
Turn 405, H (Postdoc): That 's wonderful .
Turn 406, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 407, G (Grad): But don't you think that 's {disfmarker} Don't you think that {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Turn 408, H (Postdoc): I agree .
Turn 409, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 410, B (PhD): Even people who were at the meeting .
Turn 411, E (PhD): Well , no . I mean , I {disfmarker} I just think {disfmarker} I mean , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables .
Turn 412, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 413, G (Grad): Huh .
Turn 414, E (PhD): And that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} at some point that might be awfully useful .
Turn 415, G (Grad): Right . But I think adding photographs adds a whole nother level of problems .
Turn 416, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 417, A (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 418, E (PhD): Yeah . We n uh ,
Turn 419, H (Postdoc): It 's just a digital record .
Turn 420, E (PhD): Not {disfmarker} not as part of the {disfmarker} not as a part of the data that you have to recover .
Turn 421, B (PhD): I don't mean that you model it .
Turn 422, E (PhD): Just {disfmarker} just in terms of {disfmarker}
Turn 423, B (PhD): We should just {disfmarker} Like archiving it or storing it .
Turn 424, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 425, H (Postdoc): Yes , I agree . I agree .
Turn 426, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 427, H (Postdoc): It 's i because discourse is about things ,
Turn 428, B (PhD): Because someone {disfmarker}
Turn 429, H (Postdoc): and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable .
Turn 430, B (PhD): someone later might be able to take these and say " OK , they , you know {disfmarker} at least these are the people who were there
Turn 431, E (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 432, B (PhD): and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and {disfmarker} " and just {disfmarker}
Turn 433, H (Postdoc): Yes . And it 's so simple .
Turn 434, D (Professor): Li
Turn 435, H (Postdoc): Like you said , three snapshots
Turn 436, D (Professor): uh , L L L
Turn 437, H (Postdoc): and {disfmarker}
Turn 438, D (Professor): Liz , you {disfmarker}
Turn 439, H (Postdoc): Just to archive .
Turn 440, D (Professor): u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh , {vocalsound} subcommittee meeting or whatever {disfmarker}
Turn 441, E (PhD): Actually {disfmarker}
Turn 442, D (Professor): uh , on {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} on the subcommittee meeting for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} at the , uh {disfmarker} that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was {disfmarker} was having . So I {disfmarker} I wasn't there . They {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that .
Turn 443, B (PhD): Big , big interest . Huge .
Turn 444, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 445, B (PhD): I mean , it {disfmarker} personally , I don't {disfmarker} I would never want to deal with it . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in .
Turn 446, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 447, B (PhD): You know , fusing gesture and face recognition ,
Turn 448, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 449, B (PhD): even lip movement and things like that , for this kind of task . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of {disfmarker} in storing these images in any data we collect
Turn 450, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 451, B (PhD): so that later we can do other things with it .
Turn 452, D (Professor): Yeah . So {disfmarker} so to address what {disfmarker} what Adam 's saying ,
Turn 453, H (Postdoc): Mmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 454, B (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 455, D (Professor): I mean , I think you {disfmarker} uh , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .
Turn 456, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 457, D (Professor): And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . Right ?
Turn 458, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 459, D (Professor): So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 460, G (Grad): But that {disfmarker} it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it .
Turn 461, D (Professor): Right . So we 're gonna {disfmarker} So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us .
Turn 462, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 463, B (PhD): I think even doing something very crude {disfmarker}
Turn 464, D (Professor): But having {disfmarker}
Turn 465, B (PhD): Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time .
Turn 466, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 467, B (PhD): And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , uh , perplexity ,
Turn 468, G (Grad): Low fidelity .
Turn 469, B (PhD): yeah , {comment} way of {disfmarker} of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile .
Turn 470, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 471, H (Postdoc): I agree . And if it 's simple as {disfmarker} I mean , as simple as just the digital {disfmarker}
Turn 472, B (PhD): Otherwise you 'd {disfmarker} you lose it .
Turn 473, D (Professor): Well , minimally , I mean , what {disfmarker} what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people ,
Turn 474, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 475, D (Professor): cuz we are interested in some spatial processing .
Turn 476, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 477, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 478, D (Professor): And so {disfmarker}
Turn 479, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 480, D (Professor): so , um {disfmarker}
Turn 481, G (Grad): Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier
Turn 482, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 483, G (Grad): cuz you 'll {disfmarker}
Turn 484, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 485, G (Grad): Well , the wireless .
Turn 486, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 487, G (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 488, B (PhD): Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have {pause} said , I talked to the student who had done this , {comment} that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they {disfmarker} they just recorded all the time
Turn 489, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 490, B (PhD): and were able to get all the information from {disfmarker} or maybe it was three {disfmarker} from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be {disfmarker} we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it {comment} at all .
Turn 491, G (Grad): Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't disagree . I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .
Turn 492, C (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 493, G (Grad): So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say " I won't participate " .
Turn 494, H (Postdoc): Well , she 's not {pause} making {disfmarker}
Turn 495, C (Professor): That 's true .
Turn 496, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 497, B (PhD): Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head
Turn 498, G (Grad): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 499, B (PhD): and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting {vocalsound} talking .
Turn 500, D (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 501, B (PhD): That would be an interes {vocalsound} Bu
Turn 502, H (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 503, D (Professor): Great idea .
Turn 504, H (Postdoc): Well , there 's {disfmarker} that 'd be the {disfmarker} the parallel , yeah . But I think y she 's {disfmarker} we 're just proposing {pause} a minimal preservation of things on boards ,
Turn 505, B (PhD): Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera .
Turn 506, H (Postdoc): sp spatial organization {disfmarker} And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , I mean , this is {disfmarker}
Turn 507, G (Grad): But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work .
Turn 508, H (Postdoc): We can talk about the {disfmarker}
Turn 509, G (Grad): To set it up and then anonymize it ?
Turn 510, H (Postdoc): It 's just one snapshot .
Turn 511, B (PhD): No , it wa n not , um {disfmarker}
Turn 512, A (Professor): No , no , no , no .
Turn 513, H (Postdoc): We 're not talking about a movie .
Turn 514, A (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 515, B (PhD): Not for {disfmarker} not for CMU .
Turn 516, H (Postdoc): We 're talking about a snapshot .
Turn 517, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 518, B (PhD): They have a pretty crude set - up . And they had {disfmarker}
Turn 519, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 520, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 521, B (PhD): they just turn on these cameras . They were {disfmarker} they were not moving or anything .
Turn 522, G (Grad): Couldn't find it ?
Turn 523, B (PhD): And stored it on analog media .
Turn 524, G (Grad): Hmm ?
Turn 525, H (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 526, B (PhD): And they {disfmarker} they didn't actually align it or anything . They just {disfmarker} they have it , though .
Turn 527, H (Postdoc): Yeah . Well , it 's worth considering . Maybe we don't want to {disfmarker} spend that much more time discussing it ,
Turn 528, F (PhD): Did they store it digitally , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 529, H (Postdoc): but {disfmarker}
Turn 530, B (PhD): Hmm - mm . I think they just {disfmarker}
Turn 531, F (PhD): or just put it on videotape ?
Turn 532, B (PhD): I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Um ,
Turn 533, D (Professor): Mm - hmm . Well , I think for {disfmarker} I mean , for our purposes we probably will d
Turn 534, B (PhD): I 'm not sure .
Turn 535, D (Professor): we {disfmarker} we might try that some and {disfmarker} and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , uh , which , you know , we we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get other value out of , I think .
Turn 536, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 537, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 538, H (Postdoc): Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it {disfmarker} it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And {disfmarker}
Turn 539, B (PhD): I 'm just {disfmarker} The community {disfmarker} If LDC collects this data {disfmarker} u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there .
Turn 540, D (Professor): There you go .
Turn 541, B (PhD): And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are {disfmarker} actually could be , um , easier {disfmarker} made easier if you had {pause} the video .
Turn 542, D (Professor): I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing .
Turn 543, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 544, D (Professor): As you say , if they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , uh , and {disfmarker} and will include all that .
Turn 545, B (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 546, D (Professor): Um ,
Turn 547, A (Professor): e
Turn 548, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it . In other words , it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I {disfmarker} I am int I do think that we m minimally want {disfmarker} something {disfmarker} we might want to look at {disfmarker} at some {disfmarker} some , uh , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of the boards ,
Turn 549, B (PhD): Of the board .
Turn 550, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 551, B (PhD): Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board .
Turn 552, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 553, H (Postdoc): Exactly .
Turn 554, D (Professor): a and know the position of the people {disfmarker}
Turn 555, B (PhD): That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured .
Turn 556, H (Postdoc): Exactly .
Turn 557, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 558, B (PhD): I mean , otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .
Turn 559, H (Postdoc): We {disfmarker} And it {disfmarker} Especially since this is common knowledge . I mean , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording .
Turn 560, G (Grad): Uh , except in {disfmarker}
Turn 561, H (Postdoc): s
Turn 562, G (Grad): er , if we weren't recording this , this {disfmarker} this would get lost . Right ?
Turn 563, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 564, H (Postdoc): Well , I don't understand that point . I mean , I just think that the {disfmarker}
Turn 565, G (Grad): The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . Right ? In {disfmarker} in {pause} our real - life setting .
Turn 566, H (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 567, A (Professor): What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you .
Turn 568, C (Professor): And you 're gonna send it out by email , too .
Turn 569, G (Grad): Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it .
Turn 570, B (PhD): Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , um , is in the record .
Turn 571, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 572, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 573, H (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 574, A (Professor): Well , that 's why {disfmarker} that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be {disfmarker} I think in many {disfmarker} for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , we {disfmarker} uh , we don't need to require it . Just like the {disfmarker}
Turn 575, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 576, A (Professor): I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting . Um ,
Turn 577, H (Postdoc): I agree .
Turn 578, A (Professor): so {disfmarker} so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . So .
Turn 579, D (Professor): So {disfmarker} So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , uh , so I guess that 's th the way {disfmarker} what you were figuring on doing was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to {disfmarker} to everybody from {disfmarker} from today ? OK . So . Um {disfmarker}
Turn 580, H (Postdoc): That 's great .
Turn 581, D (Professor): So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so the question {comment} that {disfmarker} that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during {disfmarker} during th during the collection .
Turn 582, B (PhD): Ow .
Turn 583, D (Professor): And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the {disfmarker} was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that .
Turn 584, A (Professor): Well , before we leave the CrossPads and {disfmarker} and call it done .
Turn 585, D (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 586, A (Professor): So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ?
Turn 587, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 588, A (Professor): So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna {disfmarker} n I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But {disfmarker} but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe it 's no big deal .
Turn 589, D (Professor): What {disfmarker}
Turn 590, A (Professor): Maybe we just do it and see what happens .
Turn 591, D (Professor): I guess the point was to try {disfmarker} again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for {disfmarker} for the UI stuff .
Turn 592, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 593, D (Professor): So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do .
Turn 594, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 595, D (Professor): So it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Right now he 's g operating from zero ,
Turn 596, A (Professor): Nothing .
Turn 597, D (Professor): and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would {disfmarker} could still {disfmarker} You shou
Turn 598, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 599, D (Professor): I mean , at least try it .
Turn 600, B (PhD): I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept .
Turn 601, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 602, B (PhD): It will {disfmarker}
Turn 603, A (Professor): Right . OK .
Turn 604, B (PhD): You know , what you can do with things .
Turn 605, G (Grad): And {disfmarker} and they seem to {pause} not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well .
Turn 606, B (PhD): Yeah . But not {disfmarker} not to rely on them for {pause} basic modeling .
Turn 607, A (Professor): That 's true . So if it {disfmarker} if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me .
Turn 608, G (Grad): Yeah , I 'm not sure . I think it it {disfmarker} it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it .
Turn 609, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 610, G (Grad): Um , but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it .
Turn 611, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 612, D (Professor): I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another .
Turn 613, G (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do .
Turn 614, D (Professor): And so we try it out and see how it works .
Turn 615, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 616, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 617, B (PhD): I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those .
Turn 618, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 619, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 620, G (Grad): Right . I ag I think I agree with that .
Turn 621, B (PhD): It 's just {disfmarker}
Turn 622, A (Professor): Right . OK .
Turn 623, G (Grad): I think , though , the importance marking is a {pause} good idea , though . That if {disfmarker} if people have something in front of them {disfmarker}
Turn 624, B (PhD): I 'd be sort of cool . I mean , it would {disfmarker} Yeah . That w shouldn't be hard for {disfmarker}
Turn 625, G (Grad): Yeah . Do it on pilots or laptops or something . OK , if something 's important everyone clap .
Turn 626, A (Professor): OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens .
Turn 627, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 628, G (Grad): Yeah . Um , I think that 's right .
Turn 629, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 630, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 631, A (Professor): The note - taking {disfmarker} So , I {disfmarker} I think that this is gonna be useful . So if we record data I will definitely ask for it . So , I j I think we should just say this is not {disfmarker} we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could {disfmarker} could they send it to us ?
Turn 632, G (Grad): Yeah . Oh , OK . That 's fine . Absolutely .
Turn 633, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 634, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 635, A (Professor): And then {disfmarker}
Turn 636, G (Grad): Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality .
Turn 637, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 638, G (Grad): But I think it {pause} definitely if they exist . And then Jane 's idea of summarization afterward I think is not a bad one . Um , picking out {disfmarker} basically to let you pick out keywords , um , and , uh , construct queries .
Turn 639, D (Professor): So who {disfmarker} who does this summarization ?
Turn 640, H (Postdoc): Yeah , I 'm thinking that {disfmarker}
Turn 641, G (Grad): People in the meeting .
Turn 642, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 643, G (Grad): You know , just at {disfmarker} at the end of the meeting , before you go ,
Turn 644, H (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 645, B (PhD): Without hearing each other though , probably .
Turn 646, G (Grad): go around the table .
Turn 647, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 648, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 649, F (PhD): Or even just have one or two people stay behind .
Turn 650, G (Grad): Yeah . Ugh . Yeah .
Turn 651, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 652, E (PhD): People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . That 's the nice thing .
Turn 653, B (PhD): Well , then you should try them a few weeks later
Turn 654, H (Postdoc): How fascinating .
Turn 655, B (PhD): and {disfmarker} They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain
Turn 656, G (Grad): And see {disfmarker} score them ?
Turn 657, E (PhD): That 's right . Well , that 's the interesting thing , though .
Turn 658, B (PhD): and wasn't {disfmarker}
Turn 659, E (PhD): If we do {disfmarker} if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently .
Turn 660, G (Grad): Oh .
Turn 661, E (PhD): It 's like {comment} this is not what we meant to research .
Turn 662, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 663, B (PhD): Right , right .
Turn 664, D (Professor): Oh . Yeah .
Turn 665, H (Postdoc): That could be very interesting .
Turn 666, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 667, F (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 668, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 669, A (Professor): But {disfmarker} but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it ,
Turn 670, D (Professor): Ru
Turn 671, G (Grad): I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though .
Turn 672, A (Professor): because I think {disfmarker} I know when I see the {disfmarker} the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door .
Turn 673, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . Running to {disfmarker} Yeah ,
Turn 674, A (Professor): So ,
Turn 675, G (Grad): fff !
Turn 676, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 677, A (Professor): you 're probably not gonna get {pause} a lot of people wanting to do this .
Turn 678, G (Grad): Maybe e Is email easier ?
Turn 679, H (Postdoc): Well , I think if {disfmarker}
Turn 680, G (Grad): I mean , I {disfmarker} when you first said do {disfmarker} do it , um , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up
Turn 681, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 682, G (Grad): and you have to hook them up to the recorder . So , if they 're already here I think that 's good ,
Turn 683, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 684, G (Grad): but if they 're not already here for {disfmarker} I 'd rather do email . I 'm much faster typing than anything else .
Turn 685, H (Postdoc): Yeah , I 'd just try {disfmarker} Well , however the least intrusive and {disfmarker} and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave .
Turn 686, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 687, A (Professor): Yeah . I think that {disfmarker} I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time .
Turn 688, G (Grad): I don't know . At {disfmarker}
Turn 689, A (Professor): I just don't {disfmarker}
Turn 690, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 691, A (Professor): because they 're kind of a captive audience . Once they leave ,
Turn 692, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 693, A (Professor): you know , forget it . But {disfmarker} but i
Turn 694, G (Grad): Yeah , read the digits , do the summary .
Turn 695, A (Professor): Right . But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily {disfmarker} you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll get many people willing to stay .
Turn 696, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 697, A (Professor): But , you know , if you get even one {disfmarker}
Turn 698, H (Postdoc): w
Turn 699, D (Professor): Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing ,
Turn 700, H (Postdoc): I would s Yeah .
Turn 701, D (Professor): that {disfmarker} that y that you can't {disfmarker} certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . But {disfmarker} but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful .
Turn 702, F (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 703, H (Postdoc): And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , uh , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be uh ,
Turn 704, E (PhD): Yeah . It 's kind of nice .
Turn 705, H (Postdoc): an ad addition to their database .
Turn 706, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 707, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 708, H (Postdoc): Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed ,
Turn 709, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 710, H (Postdoc): just {disfmarker}
Turn 711, F (PhD): So I have a question about queries ,
Turn 712, G (Grad): God , that 's bugging me .
Turn 713, F (PhD): which is , um ,
Turn 714, G (Grad): Can we turn that light off ?
Turn 715, H (Postdoc): You turn {disfmarker}
Turn 716, F (PhD): uh {disfmarker}
Turn 717, G (Grad): If {disfmarker} can we turn that just {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that let {disfmarker}
Turn 718, D (Professor): The fl the fluorescent light is flickering .
Turn 719, H (Postdoc): Uh , let the record show the light is flickering .
Turn 720, F (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 721, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 722, G (Grad): Yeah , there 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 723, B (PhD): Oh , it is {disfmarker} it is like {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 724, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 725, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 726, G (Grad): Very annoying .
Turn 727, F (PhD): There you go . OK .
Turn 728, G (Grad): Oh , much better .
Turn 729, A (Professor): For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired .
Turn 730, C (Professor): Oh , yeah .
Turn 731, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 732, C (Professor): That 's better .
Turn 733, F (PhD): Good .
Turn 734, A (Professor): That and y {comment} Too much caffeine and really tired ,
Turn 735, G (Grad): Too much caffeine .
Turn 736, A (Professor): but then I thought " no , maybe that 's real " .
Turn 737, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 738, F (PhD): So ,
Turn 739, G (Grad): I thought it was the projector for a moment . It was like , " what 's going on ? "
Turn 740, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 741, F (PhD): the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are {disfmarker} are we gonna try and o
Turn 742, G (Grad): We {disfmarker} we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ?
Turn 743, F (PhD): Yeah . Well , I mean ,
Turn 744, G (Grad): And so that was one suggestion .
Turn 745, F (PhD): so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself ,
Turn 746, D (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 747, F (PhD): so that it may not be a feasible thing . But {disfmarker}
Turn 748, E (PhD): Hello . Dan here .
Turn 749, F (PhD): n
Turn 750, B (PhD): Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ?
Turn 751, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 752, B (PhD): I mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where {pause} we are right now .
Turn 753, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 754, B (PhD): They 're the expert
Turn 755, E (PhD): Mari ?
Turn 756, A (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 757, E (PhD): Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ?
Turn 758, A (Professor): Um , {vocalsound} what 's our schedule ?
Turn 759, D (Professor): Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz .
Turn 760, A (Professor): Let 's see , you and I need dis Uh , no , we did the Liz talk .
Turn 761, D (Professor): And you and I need to Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk .
Turn 762, A (Professor): Yeah . So {disfmarker} so that was the prosody thing .
Turn 763, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 764, B (PhD): We - {vocalsound} I don't remember it .
Turn 765, A (Professor): Um , we need to finish the {disfmarker}
Turn 766, D (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 767, A (Professor): It 's already four - fifteen .
Turn 768, B (PhD): I have like no recall memory .
Turn 769, A (Professor): Uh , after .
Turn 770, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 771, A (Professor): We need to {pause} finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So ,
Turn 772, G (Grad): And what ?
Turn 773, A (Professor): um {disfmarker}
Turn 774, D (Professor): I 'm at your disposal . So , up to you .
Turn 775, A (Professor): Um , what {disfmarker} what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should {disfmarker}
Turn 776, D (Professor): Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ?
Turn 777, G (Grad): At least . Yeah .
Turn 778, A (Professor): Uh , less .
Turn 779, G (Grad): m i Even if that much ?
Turn 780, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 781, D (Professor): Less ?
Turn 782, G (Grad): Less .
Turn 783, A (Professor): So , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 784, B (PhD): It 's interesting that he 's got , like , {pause} this discussion free
Turn 785, D (Professor): Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on .
Turn 786, A (Professor): Action {disfmarker} Yeah .  So ,
Turn 787, B (PhD): yet it 's separate .
Turn 788, D (Professor): And {disfmarker}
Turn 789, A (Professor): e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 790, E (PhD): OK , five - thirty .
Turn 791, A (Professor): Is that OK ? We 'll probably hit horrible traffic .
Turn 792, E (PhD): Sounds {disfmarker} OK . h Thanks , bye .
Turn 793, A (Professor): That 's not a lot of time ,
Turn 794, E (PhD): That 's that .
Turn 795, A (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 796, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 797, G (Grad): Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " , um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So he has very little manpower . Um , there 's very little allocated for him and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff .
Turn 798, D (Professor): Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I {disfmarker} I actually think that {disfmarker} that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , {comment} if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with queries , uh , could at least give {disfmarker} give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . I mean , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and {disfmarker} the people are talking about and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 799, B (PhD): But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . That 's what I 'm worried about . So you might as well just give him the summaries .
Turn 800, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 801, B (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 802, D (Professor): Maybe .
Turn 803, F (PhD): Well , I 'm not sure {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem .
Turn 804, G (Grad): y Well , but I think {disfmarker}
Turn 805, B (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 806, F (PhD): Right ? Of how to {disfmarker} how to generate queries from a {disfmarker}
Turn 807, B (PhD): How to do this from the summary .
Turn 808, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 809, G (Grad): I , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 810, F (PhD): That was sort of what my {pause} question was {pause} aimed towards .
Turn 811, B (PhD): So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it
Turn 812, A (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 813, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 814, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 815, B (PhD): and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or {disfmarker} or a deeper {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 816, G (Grad): Or {disfmarker} or just a memory refresher .
Turn 817, B (PhD): But that 's done off {disfmarker} they have to do that off - line .
Turn 818, G (Grad): Yep . I agree .
Turn 819, B (PhD): You
Turn 820, H (Postdoc): I 'm also wondering if we could ask the {disfmarker} the people a {disfmarker} a question which would be " what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? " Becau - in terms of like informativeness ,
Turn 821, B (PhD): That 's a good one .
Turn 822, H (Postdoc): it might be , you know , that the summary would {disfmarker} would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact .
Turn 823, D (Professor): I would think that would be the most likely thing .
Turn 824, B (PhD): Dan doesn't know what sex he is .
Turn 825, E (PhD): Yeah , really .
Turn 826, A (Professor): But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting .
Turn 827, H (Postdoc): I think you get two different types of information .
Turn 828, A (Professor): You get two {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 829, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 830, H (Postdoc): Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the {disfmarker} what the meeting was about .
Turn 831, D (Professor): Hey .
Turn 832, B (PhD): Ah
Turn 833, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 834, G (Grad): We 're still here .
Turn 835, H (Postdoc): So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about {pause} with the summary . But with the " what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? " {disfmarker} Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting
Turn 836, B (PhD): Going to see the kids .
Turn 837, E (PhD): You {disfmarker} you can keep it on .
Turn 838, H (Postdoc): and that {disfmarker} and that Dan worked on {disfmarker} on that . So I thought that was really {disfmarker} you know . So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings
Turn 839, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 840, H (Postdoc): but could be very informative .
Turn 841, A (Professor): Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea .
Turn 842, H (Postdoc): I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment .
Turn 843, C (Professor): Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ?
Turn 844, G (Grad): As many are willing to do it .
Turn 845, C (Professor): Make it a voluntary thing ,
Turn 846, E (PhD): Yeah . Cuz you 'll get {disfmarker} cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ?
Turn 847, C (Professor): and then {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's why I was wondering .
Turn 848, E (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 849, G (Grad): Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and {pause} generate some queries .
Turn 850, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 851, G (Grad): Of course Jane doesn't need to . I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now .
Turn 852, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 853, A (Professor): But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say {pause} what was the most interesting thing you learned ,
Turn 854, G (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 855, H (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 856, A (Professor): for those pe people willing to stay .
Turn 857, H (Postdoc): And that {disfmarker} I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some of the little things that would be hidden .
Turn 858, A (Professor): And {disfmarker} and that might be something people are willing to stay for .
Turn 859, D (Professor): Boy , I {disfmarker} I don't know how we get at this {disfmarker}
Turn 860, H (Postdoc): That would be interesting .
Turn 861, C (Professor): Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something
Turn 862, G (Grad): Or want to get up and leave .
Turn 863, C (Professor): and then you go around the room and they say " yeah , me too , I agree . "
Turn 864, G (Grad): Me too , me too , me too .
Turn 865, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 866, A (Professor): That 's fine .
Turn 867, C (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 868, E (PhD): On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ?
Turn 869, D (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 870, E (PhD): They might say " oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else " .
Turn 871, G (Grad): Well , you have the other thing , that {disfmarker} that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll {disfmarker} I mean , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is {disfmarker} is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .
Turn 872, D (Professor): It 's gonna take some thought . I mean , It seemed {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else {pause} later ,
Turn 873, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 874, D (Professor): and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else . So it 's really the imp the {disfmarker} the list of what 's important 's in the something else
Turn 875, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 876, D (Professor): rather than the {disfmarker}
Turn 877, E (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 878, D (Professor): And it might be something minor {disfmarker} of minor importance to the meeting .
Turn 879, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 880, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 881, D (Professor): Uh , in fact if {disfmarker} if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and check on it even . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's that you 're trying to find {disfmarker} {comment} You 're {disfmarker} you 've now {disfmarker} You weren't interested {disfmarker} Say I {disfmarker} I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person " .
Turn 882, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 883, D (Professor): But {disfmarker} but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is {disfmarker} what was that part that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that , uh , Mari was saying ? "
Turn 884, G (Grad): Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf "
Turn 885, A (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 886, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 887, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 888, D (Professor): And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's when I look {disfmarker} in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that {vocalsound} didn't really stick in my head the first time around and {disfmarker} but for some {comment} new reason I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old stuff .
Turn 889, G (Grad): But that {disfmarker} that 's gonna be very hard to generate .
Turn 890, A (Professor): Well , I {disfmarker} That 's hard to generate
Turn 891, D (Professor): So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 892, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 893, F (PhD): Do we {disfmarker}
Turn 894, A (Professor): and {disfmarker} and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times um , make {disfmarker} you know , think to myself " this is interesting ,
Turn 895, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 896, A (Professor): I 've gotta come back and follow up on it " .
Turn 897, D (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 898, A (Professor): So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it .
Turn 899, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 900, D (Professor): Yeah . That {disfmarker} that might get at some of what I was {disfmarker} I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new {pause} task comes along that makes me want to look up .
Turn 901, G (Grad): But {disfmarker} But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you .
Turn 902, D (Professor): Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that .
Turn 903, G (Grad): By {disfmarker} so by going around {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 904, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 905, G (Grad): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I think {pause} you can't get at all of it ,
Turn 906, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 907, G (Grad): right ? W we just need to start somewhere .
Turn 908, D (Professor): Yeah , and this is a starting point .
Turn 909, H (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 910, F (PhD): The question {disfmarker} the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by {disfmarker} you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ?
Turn 911, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 912, F (PhD): I mean , does it {disfmarker} does the bias matter ? I {disfmarker} I don't know . I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys . But {disfmarker}
Turn 913, H (Postdoc): Well , and {disfmarker} and one thing , we {disfmarker} we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " .
Turn 914, F (PhD): Uh , yeah , yeah .
Turn 915, H (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and those {disfmarker} those can be two different things .
Turn 916, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 917, F (PhD): Sure , sure . But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess that 's the question , really , is that {disfmarker} I mean ,
Turn 918, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 919, D (Professor): W
Turn 920, F (PhD): does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ?
Turn 921, D (Professor): Well , irreversible .
Turn 922, H (Postdoc): OK , good .
Turn 923, F (PhD): That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 924, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I guess what I what I {disfmarker} I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system
Turn 925, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 926, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 927, D (Professor): so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and , uh {disfmarker} and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If {disfmarker} you know , if {disfmarker} uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any {disfmarker} anything we do before that . But obviously we have to bootstrap somehow ,
Turn 928, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 929, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 930, F (PhD): Sure .
Turn 931, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 932, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 933, F (PhD): I agree .
Turn 934, H (Postdoc): I will say that {disfmarker} that I {disfmarker} I chose " interesting " because I think it includes also " important " in some cases . But , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I feel like the summary gets {pause} at a different type of information .
Turn 935, F (PhD): I think " important " can often be uninteresting .
Turn 936, A (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 937, E (PhD): Mmm . And " interesting " is more interesting than " important " .
Turn 938, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 939, H (Postdoc): Well , and {disfmarker} and also {disfmarker} i it puts a lot of burden on the person to {disfmarker} to evaluate . You know , I think inter " interesting " is {disfmarker} is non - threatening in {disfmarker}
Turn 940, A (Professor): OK - OK .
Turn 941, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 942, A (Professor): In the interest of , um ,
Turn 943, G (Grad): Importance ?
Turn 944, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 945, A (Professor): generati {comment} generating an interesting summary , {comment} um {disfmarker}
Turn 946, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 947, A (Professor): No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , uh , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , um , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , um , if Landay can get the , uh {disfmarker} get them to {disfmarker} to you guys , um , and see if they 're interesting . And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more . Um , getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway .
Turn 948, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 949, A (Professor): Um , getting {pause} just , uh , digital pictures {disfmarker} a couple digital pictures of the {disfmarker} the table and boards to set the context of the meeting . Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say {disfmarker} qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting ,
Turn 950, H (Postdoc): k
Turn 951, A (Professor): and that way you 'll get more variety .
Turn 952, H (Postdoc): Sure .
Turn 953, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 954, G (Grad): I wouldn't even say that " that they learned " .
Turn 955, H (Postdoc): That 's good . I like that . I like that .
Turn 956, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 957, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 958, G (Grad): Uh , you might want to mention something that {disfmarker} that you brought up .
Turn 959, A (Professor): " Thing {pause} that was {pause} discussed . " And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary .
Turn 960, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 961, A (Professor): OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That {disfmarker} well , that we want to do ?
Turn 962, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . A And one {disfmarker} and one qualification on {disfmarker} on the oral summaries . They 'd be s they 'd be separate . They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries .
Turn 963, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 964, G (Grad): Yeah , that 's like {disfmarker} n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever {pause} takes down the equipment then .
Turn 965, H (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and that would also be that the data would be included in the database .
Turn 966, G (Grad): Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me .
Turn 967, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 968, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 969, E (PhD): I mean , there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point .
Turn 970, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 971, E (PhD): And that if {disfmarker} if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down .
Turn 972, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 973, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 974, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 975, G (Grad): Give them a reward , a dollar a query ?
Turn 976, E (PhD): Yeah , really .
Turn 977, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 978, E (PhD): If they 're real queries .
Turn 979, A (Professor): OK . So {disfmarker}
Turn 980, D (Professor): Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a very rough system , say in a year , then {disfmarker} uh , so that in the second and third years we {disfmarker} we actually have something to {disfmarker}
Turn 981, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 982, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 983, A (Professor): Play with and generate real queries from .
Turn 984, D (Professor): ask queries .
Turn 985, A (Professor): Right . OK .
Turn 986, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 987, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 988, A (Professor): So . Yeah .
Turn 989, D (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 990, B (PhD): I think {disfmarker} I just wanted to say one thing about queries . I mean , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ?
Turn 991, G (Grad): Well , we 're gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 992, B (PhD): So you need to have some sort of {disfmarker} if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the {disfmarker} you know , if this is something that requires a {disfmarker} a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha
Turn 993, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 994, B (PhD): You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people .
Turn 995, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 996, B (PhD): In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . But they won't exist anywhere in the {pause} a you know {disfmarker}
Turn 997, G (Grad): Absolutely . So I think we 're gonna have to start with keywords
Turn 998, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 999, G (Grad): and {disfmarker} and if someone becomes more interested we could work our way up .
Turn 1000, D (Professor): I I 'm {disfmarker} I I 'm not so sure I agree with that .
Turn 1001, B (PhD): It {disfmarker} But it may well {disfmarker}
Turn 1002, G (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1003, D (Professor): Because {disfmarker} uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is .
Turn 1004, G (Grad): Really ?
Turn 1005, D (Professor): If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data .
Turn 1006, G (Grad): Oh , that 's true .
Turn 1007, D (Professor): And if it 's {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great ,
Turn 1008, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1009, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 1010, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1011, D (Professor): that 's , you know , research project for year four or something .
Turn 1012, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1013, E (PhD): Research , yeah .
Turn 1014, D (Professor): You know ?
Turn 1015, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1016, G (Grad): Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings .
Turn 1017, E (PhD): We 'd have to listen to all the data .
Turn 1018, D (Professor): Um , well , not {disfmarker} maybe not true Wizard of Oz
Turn 1019, G (Grad): So .
Turn 1020, D (Professor): because people are too
Turn 1021, G (Grad): Oh , yeah . I {disfmarker} I understand .
Turn 1022, D (Professor): uh , aware of what 's going on .
Turn 1023, E (PhD): Well just imagine if {disfmarker}
Turn 1024, D (Professor): But {disfmarker} but just {disfmarker}
Turn 1025, E (PhD): Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment ,
Turn 1026, D (Professor): Yeah . w Just " what would you like to know ? "
Turn 1027, E (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 1028, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1029, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1030, G (Grad): But that {disfmarker} neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is .
Turn 1031, E (PhD): Yes .
Turn 1032, H (Postdoc): I I was wondering if {disfmarker} if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like " action item " ,
Turn 1033, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1034, H (Postdoc): which could be obtained from the text {disfmarker} from the transcript .
Turn 1035, G (Grad): Right . Since we have the transcript .
Turn 1036, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1037, G (Grad): Dates maybe . I don't know . That 's something I always forget .
Turn 1038, H (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified ,
Turn 1039, B (PhD): Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you .
Turn 1040, H (Postdoc): but text - oriented .
Turn 1041, B (PhD): I mean , in gen that 's all I remember from most meetings .
Turn 1042, G (Grad): That {disfmarker} that 's all I wrote down .
Turn 1043, H (Postdoc): I think you 'd remember that , yeah .
Turn 1044, B (PhD): So , in general , I mean , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to {pause} do this . It {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker}
Turn 1045, H (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's true . Well , but then you could {disfmarker} you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " , you know , whatever .
Turn 1046, E (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1047, H (Postdoc): But {disfmarker} but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query .
Turn 1048, B (PhD): I mean , that 's realistically what people might {pause} well be remembering .
Turn 1049, H (Postdoc): So .
Turn 1050, B (PhD): So .
Turn 1051, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1052, H (Postdoc): Yeah . Well , but {disfmarker} you know , but you could get again @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 1053, A (Professor): Well , we 're piloting . We 'll just do it and see what happens .
Turn 1054, B (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1055, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1056, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1057, D (Professor): I usually don't remember my action items . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'd {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 1058, A (Professor): OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ?
Turn 1059, D (Professor): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 1060, G (Grad): Sure . Can you hand me my note pad ?
Turn 1061, H (Postdoc): Yeah . yeah .
Turn 1062, A (Professor): Um , or maybe we should wait until the summary of this {disfmarker} until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav
Turn 1063, D (Professor): We {disfmarker} we had {disfmarker} I mean ,
Turn 1064, E (PhD): Yeah . Then we 'll know .
Turn 1065, G (Grad): Thanks .
Turn 1066, D (Professor): somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess {disfmarker} Did y did you get enough milestone , uh , from the description things ?
Turn 1067, A (Professor): I got {disfmarker} Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . eee ,
Turn 1068, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 1069, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1070, D (Professor): And , you know , there 's obviously {pause} detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . So , you just have to {pause} let us know .
Turn 1071, A (Professor): OK . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , um , {vocalsound} requirements .
Turn 1072, H (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 1073, A (Professor): Uh ,
Turn 1074, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1075, A (Professor): people are supposed to send me U R for their {disfmarker} for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . And you 're s
Turn 1076, E (PhD): Right . We {disfmarker}
Turn 1077, A (Professor): Hmm ?
Turn 1078, E (PhD): we need to look at our web page
Turn 1079, A (Professor): And {disfmarker} and you also need to look at your web page
Turn 1080, E (PhD): and make one that 's {disfmarker} that 's p
Turn 1081, A (Professor): and clean it up by mid - July .
Turn 1082, E (PhD): PDA - free .
Turn 1083, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 1084, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1085, A (Professor): Um ,
Turn 1086, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 1087, A (Professor): let 's see . Choo - choo - choo . We {disfmarker}
Turn 1088, G (Grad): Mailing lists .
Turn 1089, A (Professor): Mailing list ? Uh , you need to put together a mailing list .
Turn 1090, D (Professor): Three of them .
Turn 1091, A (Professor): Uh , I think w
Turn 1092, D (Professor): Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean ,
Turn 1093, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1094, D (Professor): uh ,
Turn 1095, A (Professor): Um ,
Turn 1096, D (Professor): mostly together .
Turn 1097, A (Professor): uh , I need to email Adam or Jane , um , about getting the data . Who should I email ?
Turn 1098, G (Grad): Uh , how quickly do you want it ?
Turn 1099, A (Professor): Um .
Turn 1100, G (Grad): My July is really very crowded . And so , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1101, A (Professor): How about if I just c Uh , Right now all I want {disfmarker} I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now {disfmarker} But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . But I think all he would want is the digits . Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . I 'm interested in getting the language model data . Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions .
Turn 1102, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1103, A (Professor): So then just email you ?
Turn 1104, H (Postdoc): OK . So y Sure , sure , sure .
Turn 1105, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1106, D (Professor): Wh
Turn 1107, H (Postdoc): You could email to both of us , uh , just {disfmarker} I mean , if you wanted to .
Turn 1108, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1109, H (Postdoc): I mean , I don't think either of us would mind recei
Turn 1110, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1111, D (Professor): i
Turn 1112, G (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 1113, H (Postdoc): but {disfmarker} but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the {disfmarker}
Turn 1114, A (Professor): And your email is ?
Turn 1115, D (Professor): i
Turn 1116, H (Postdoc): Edwards at ICSI .
Turn 1117, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1118, D (Professor): w
Turn 1119, G (Grad): Dot Berkeley dot EDU , of course .
Turn 1120, A (Professor): And then {disfmarker}
Turn 1121, D (Professor): In {disfmarker} in our phone call , uh , before , we {disfmarker} we , uh {disfmarker} It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , uh , And , uh {disfmarker} and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and {vocalsound} give it to a transcription service , uh , that will {disfmarker}
Turn 1122, G (Grad): Oh , is this IBM ?
Turn 1123, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1124, H (Postdoc): Yeah , using foot pedals
Turn 1125, D (Professor): Yeah , foot {disfmarker} foot pedals
Turn 1126, H (Postdoc): and {disfmarker}
Turn 1127, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 1128, G (Grad): Uh , so do they {disfmarker} How are they gonna do the multi - channel ?
Turn 1129, D (Professor): See , that 's a good question .
Turn 1130, H (Postdoc): Yeah . They {disfmarker} they don't have a way .
Turn 1131, G (Grad): I thought so .
Turn 1132, D (Professor): No , I mean , it 'll be
Turn 1133, H (Postdoc): But they have a verification .
Turn 1134, D (Professor): probably about like you did ,
Turn 1135, G (Grad): Mix ?
Turn 1136, D (Professor): and then there will be some things {disfmarker} you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll {disfmarker} they 'll , uh {disfmarker} they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which {disfmarker} you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . And , uh {disfmarker} I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ?
Turn 1137, G (Grad): OK . That 's , uh , my question .
Turn 1138, D (Professor): We 'll give them all the {disfmarker} the multi - channel stuff
Turn 1139, G (Grad): So we 'll give them all sixteen channels
Turn 1140, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 1141, G (Grad): and they 'll do whatever they want with it .
Turn 1142, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1143, B (PhD): But you also should probably give them the mixed {disfmarker} You know , equal sound - level {disfmarker}
Turn 1144, D (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} Good idea .
Turn 1145, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1146, B (PhD): I mean , they 're not gonna easily be able to do that , probably .
Turn 1147, G (Grad): It 's not hard .
Turn 1148, D (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1149, B (PhD): Ah , yeah .
Turn 1150, G (Grad): So .
Turn 1151, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1152, D (Professor): It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed .
Turn 1153, F (PhD): But w
Turn 1154, B (PhD): I
Turn 1155, F (PhD): It 's not {disfmarker}
Turn 1156, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 1157, F (PhD): Right . It doesn't {disfmarker} it isn't difficult for us to do ,
Turn 1158, G (Grad): Yep . Absolutely .
Turn 1159, B (PhD): i You should {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 1160, F (PhD): so we might as well just do it .
Turn 1161, B (PhD): You should {disfmarker} that may be all that they want to send off to their {pause} transcribers .
Turn 1162, G (Grad): Absolutely . So , sure .
Turn 1163, A (Professor): OK . Related to {disfmarker} to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , uh , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did .
Turn 1164, H (Postdoc): I did . I {disfmarker} I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions which you got a copy of today .
Turn 1165, D (Professor): Right . And I was gonna m email them the {disfmarker} which I haven't yet , a pointer to {disfmarker} to the web pages that we {disfmarker} that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the {disfmarker} the way the recording room is set up
Turn 1166, H (Postdoc): Good .
Turn 1167, D (Professor): and so on , your {disfmarker} your page on that .
Turn 1168, H (Postdoc): Oh , excellent . Good .
Turn 1169, G (Grad): And then p possibly {disfmarker}
Turn 1170, H (Postdoc): I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . I should have sent {disfmarker} I should have CC ' ed you as well .
Turn 1171, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1172, G (Grad): Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for {disfmarker} for higher - level information .
Turn 1173, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1174, D (Professor): Oh , yeah . We were gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 1175, G (Grad): Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . We 're gonna have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that .
Turn 1176, A (Professor): Yeah . We never had our data format discussion .
Turn 1177, D (Professor): Yeah , we w Right .
Turn 1178, H (Postdoc): Oh , I thought we did . We discussed , uh , musi musical score notation
Turn 1179, A (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 1180, G (Grad): But that 's not {disfmarker} That 's display .
Turn 1181, H (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and its XML {disfmarker}
Turn 1182, G (Grad): That 's different than format .
Turn 1183, A (Professor): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1184, H (Postdoc): Well , um {disfmarker}
Turn 1185, A (Professor): W My {disfmarker} my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work
Turn 1186, E (PhD): Well {disfmarker} uh , yeah .
Turn 1187, A (Professor): and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with .
Turn 1188, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1189, A (Professor): Um ,
Turn 1190, H (Postdoc): OK , excellent .
Turn 1191, A (Professor): other people may not agree with that ,
Turn 1192, D (Professor): OK . So , what n important thing {disfmarker}
Turn 1193, A (Professor): but {disfmarker} Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data ,
Turn 1194, H (Postdoc): Well , it c
Turn 1195, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 1196, A (Professor): so I shouldn't be the one to talk . But {disfmarker}
Turn 1197, C (Professor): No , I think that 's fine .
Turn 1198, D (Professor): So a key thing will be that you {disfmarker} we tell you
Turn 1199, H (Postdoc): Great .
Turn 1200, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1201, D (Professor): what it is . Uh , we also had {disfmarker}
Turn 1202, F (PhD): " Here 's a mysterious file
Turn 1203, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1204, F (PhD): and {disfmarker} "
Turn 1205, D (Professor): We also had the , uh , uh {disfmarker} that we were s uh , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number
Turn 1206, A (Professor): Oh , yeah .
Turn 1207, D (Professor): and we 're all gonna {disfmarker} we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and {disfmarker} and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , uh , users .
Turn 1208, C (Professor): Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . So if you could ask other people to call and use our system , that 'd be good . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems ,
Turn 1209, A (Professor): Yeah . Or , {vocalsound} like if you have a {disfmarker}
Turn 1210, C (Professor): who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that .
Turn 1211, A (Professor): Or , like if you have somebody who makes your {disfmarker} your plane reservations for you ,
Turn 1212, C (Professor): So .
Turn 1213, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1214, A (Professor): um , which is
Turn 1215, D (Professor): Yeah , we can do that .
Turn 1216, A (Professor): the n
Turn 1217, G (Grad): Get my parents to do it .
Turn 1218, A (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . Seriously .
Turn 1219, C (Professor): Yeah , for instance .
Turn 1220, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1221, C (Professor): Your grandmother .
Turn 1222, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1223, A (Professor): Yeah . e You know , it could {pause} result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . So {disfmarker} Um , anyway {disfmarker}
Turn 1224, D (Professor): Yeah . 
Turn 1225, G (Grad): I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang {disfmarker} hung up .
Turn 1226, A (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 1227, D (Professor): My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it
Turn 1228, G (Grad): He would never use it .
Turn 1229, D (Professor): but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel .
Turn 1230, A (Professor): OK . Um , other {disfmarker}
Turn 1231, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 1232, A (Professor): Let 's see , other action items . So I have the {disfmarker}
Turn 1233, D (Professor): We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're {disfmarker} you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh , major communications between Dan and {vocalsound} UW folks
Turn 1234, E (PhD): Yeah . I mean ,
Turn 1235, A (Professor): I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm shooting to try to get it done {disfmarker} get it put together by {pause} the beginning of August .
Turn 1236, D (Professor): as to {disfmarker}
Turn 1237, E (PhD): we should talk about it , but {disfmarker}
Turn 1238, H (Postdoc): Mmm .
Turn 1239, A (Professor): So , um , you know , if
Turn 1240, D (Professor): But we have {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty {disfmarker} We don't know . I mean , he {disfmarker} he s uh , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust
Turn 1241, A (Professor): We don't know .
Turn 1242, D (Professor): and {disfmarker} and so we don't know ,
Turn 1243, A (Professor): i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off ,
Turn 1244, D (Professor): i e
Turn 1245, A (Professor): but a at least it 's worth trying .
Turn 1246, G (Grad): Mm - hmm . What is it ?
Turn 1247, D (Professor): We don't know .
Turn 1248, G (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 1249, D (Professor): " Recording equipment . "
Turn 1250, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1251, G (Grad): It 's a tape recorder .
Turn 1252, D (Professor): W We know it 's eight channels . Uh , we know it 's digital .
Turn 1253, G (Grad): It 's eight tape recorders .
Turn 1254, D (Professor): We don't even know if there 're microphones . So , we 'll find out .
Turn 1255, A (Professor): OK . Um , and I will email these notes {disfmarker} Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody {disfmarker} I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads .
Turn 1256, D (Professor): Yeah , OK . I 'll do that .
Turn 1257, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1258, D (Professor): Um , and he also said something about outside {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} that came up about the outside text sources , that he {disfmarker} he may have
Turn 1259, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1260, A (Professor): Oh !
Turn 1261, D (Professor): some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model .
Turn 1262, C (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1263, E (PhD): Yeah , that was {disfmarker} uh , that was {disfmarker} What he was saying was this {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} this thing that , uh , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . Well , that 's the idea . So that that {disfmarker} that would be a source of text which is {disfmarker} supposedly got the right vocabulary .
Turn 1264, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1265, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 1266, E (PhD): But it 's obviously very different material . It 's not spoken material , for instance ,
Turn 1267, D (Professor): Yeah . But it 's p it might be {disfmarker}
Turn 1268, E (PhD): so {disfmarker}
Turn 1269, A (Professor): But {disfmarker} but that 's actually what I wanna do . That 's {disfmarker} that 's what I wanna work with ,
Turn 1270, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 1271, A (Professor): is {disfmarker} is things that s the wrong material but the right da the right source .
Turn 1272, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1273, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1274, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1275, G (Grad): Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore .
Turn 1276, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1277, G (Grad): He 's switching to other stuff again .
Turn 1278, A (Professor): Yeah . He seemed {disfmarker} when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send him email . I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it . And if I get something , great . If I don't get something {disfmarker}
Turn 1279, G (Grad): Who ? Landay or Jason ?
Turn 1280, A (Professor): Landay . And , uh , um ,
Turn 1281, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 1282, G (Grad): OK .
Turn 1283, A (Professor): you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or {disfmarker} I could {disfmarker} I could use , uh {disfmarker} I could use your web pages . That 's what we could do . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor
Turn 1284, D (Professor): Yeah , why search for them ?
Turn 1285, A (Professor): Yeah !
Turn 1286, D (Professor): They 're {disfmarker} we know where they are .
Turn 1287, G (Grad): True .
Turn 1288, D (Professor): Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 1289, G (Grad): Absolutely .
Turn 1290, A (Professor): Oh , forget this !
Turn 1291, E (PhD): Sure .
Turn 1292, G (Grad): Well , but that 's not very much .
Turn 1293, A (Professor): I {disfmarker} One less action item . I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders .
Turn 1294, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1295, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 1296, G (Grad): I mean , that {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like search .
Turn 1297, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1298, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1299, D (Professor): Yeah . So we can {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} we can do better than that .
Turn 1300, E (PhD): We can do that . Yeah .
Turn 1301, G (Grad): So you could {disfmarker}
Turn 1302, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1303, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1304, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1305, D (Professor): There 's {disfmarker} there 's some , uh , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On {disfmarker} on meeting recording ,
Turn 1306, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1307, B (PhD): And Xerox .
Turn 1308, A (Professor): So , there 's {disfmarker} there 's ICSI , Xerox ,
Turn 1309, D (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 1310, B (PhD): And there 's {disfmarker} You should l look under , like , intelligent environments ,
Turn 1311, D (Professor): And Xerox . Yeah .
Turn 1312, B (PhD): smart rooms ,
Turn 1313, G (Grad): Um , the " Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand " is a good one .
Turn 1314, B (PhD): um {disfmarker}
Turn 1315, A (Professor): CMU ,
Turn 1316, B (PhD): Right . And then {disfmarker} Right . J There 's {disfmarker} th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera ,
Turn 1317, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1318, B (PhD): because of all these classroom {disfmarker}
Turn 1319, G (Grad): Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room .
Turn 1320, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1321, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1322, G (Grad): And I want to try to stay away from that . So {disfmarker}
Turn 1323, A (Professor): OK . Great . That solves that problem . One less action item . Um {disfmarker} OK . I think that 's good enou that 's {disfmarker} that 's pretty much all I can think of .
Turn 1324, H (Postdoc): Can I ask , uh , one thing ? It relates to data {disfmarker} data collection and I {disfmarker} and I 'd {disfmarker} and we mentioned earlier today , this question of {disfmarker} um , so , um , I s I know that from {disfmarker} with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened . But I wonder if {disfmarker} Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever .
Turn 1325, A (Professor): Oh , yeah .
Turn 1326, H (Postdoc): Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , I mean , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task {disfmarker} so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap .
Turn 1327, F (PhD): Adam !
Turn 1328, H (Postdoc): But , um , i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?
Turn 1329, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1330, E (PhD): turn off
Turn 1331, A (Professor): I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to {pause} get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the {disfmarker} the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys ,
Turn 1332, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1333, A (Professor): cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over {disfmarker}
Turn 1334, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1335, A (Professor): and {disfmarker} and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW . So , I think that {disfmarker} that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .
Turn 1336, H (Postdoc): OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to {disfmarker}
Turn 1337, A (Professor): Um ,
Turn 1338, B (PhD): They 're still gonna overlap ,
Turn 1339, H (Postdoc): OK , good .
Turn 1340, B (PhD): but {disfmarker} Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data {comment} from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political {disfmarker} Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap .
Turn 1341, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1342, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1343, D (Professor): Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap .
Turn 1344, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1345, B (PhD): So .
Turn 1346, D (Professor): So it also depends on the style of the group of people .
Turn 1347, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 1348, B (PhD): Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting .
Turn 1349, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . On the task , and the task .
Turn 1350, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1351, H (Postdoc): It 's just {disfmarker} I just wanted to {disfmarker} uh ,
Turn 1352, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1353, H (Postdoc): because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if {disfmarker} if they 're asked to .
Turn 1354, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1355, H (Postdoc): Not {disfmarker} not entirely modify it , but lessen it if {disfmarker} if it 's desired . But if {disfmarker} if that 's sufficient data {disfmarker} I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .
Turn 1356, A (Professor): OK . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different {pause} groups of people
Turn 1357, H (Postdoc): Time .
Turn 1358, A (Professor): and different sizes .
Turn 1359, H (Postdoc): Fine . And I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree .
Turn 1360, A (Professor): e e Yeah . And then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative .
Turn 1361, H (Postdoc): I just wanted to be sure .
Turn 1362, A (Professor): Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever .
Turn 1363, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Well , I {disfmarker} just as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as a contributary {disfmarker} eh , so I {disfmarker} I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know {disfmarker} you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " . So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . But {disfmarker} but these other factors are fine . I just wanted to raise the issue .
Turn 1364, A (Professor): Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to {comment} is because I wanted it to be {pause} as , uh , unintrusive as possi
Turn 1365, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 1366, A (Professor): as you could be with these things hanging on you .
Turn 1367, H (Postdoc): Oh , yeah . Yeah , I think that 's always desired . I just want to be sure we don't {disfmarker} that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can . Yeah .
Turn 1368, D (Professor): Yeah . Did they discuss any of that in the {disfmarker} the meeting they had with L Liberman ?
Turn 1369, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1370, D (Professor): What {disfmarker}
Turn 1371, B (PhD): And there was a big division ,
Turn 1372, D (Professor): What {disfmarker} what do they {disfmarker}
Turn 1373, B (PhD): so Liberman and others {pause} were interested in a lot of found data .
Turn 1374, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1375, B (PhD): So there 's lots of recordings that {disfmarker} They 're not close - talk mike ,
Turn 1376, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1377, B (PhD): but {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings . Boring stuff like that . Um , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in {disfmarker} cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data . And , I guess we just left it as {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} that {pause} if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,
Turn 1378, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1379, B (PhD): but newly collected data would {disfmarker} would be natural meetings . So .
Turn 1380, D (Professor): Actually , th @ @ {comment} the CMU folk have collected a lot of data . Is that {disfmarker} is that going to be publicly available ,
Turn 1381, B (PhD): As far as I know , they h have not .
Turn 1382, D (Professor): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1383, B (PhD): Um , but e
Turn 1384, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 1385, G (Grad): It 's also {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not near - far , right ?
Turn 1386, B (PhD): I 'm not sure . Um , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I {disfmarker} I got the feeling there was some politics involved .
Turn 1387, G (Grad): I think @ @ gonna add that to one of my action items .
Turn 1388, B (PhD): No .
Turn 1389, D (Professor): Just to check .
Turn 1390, B (PhD): I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 1391, D (Professor): Yeah . W we should know what 's out there certainly .
Turn 1392, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1393, B (PhD): I mean , the {disfmarker}
Turn 1394, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1395, G (Grad): Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field ,
Turn 1396, B (PhD): I think you need to talk to Waibel and {disfmarker}
Turn 1397, G (Grad): intelligent - room sorts of things .
Turn 1398, E (PhD): Oh , really ? It 's those guys .
Turn 1399, G (Grad): I hadn't known that then {disfmarker} they 'd done any more than that .
Turn 1400, D (Professor): Oh , they only did the far - field ? I see .
Turn 1401, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1402, B (PhD): But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . But as far as I know they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting .
Turn 1403, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1404, B (PhD): But that could change cuz Mark {disfmarker} you know , Mark 's really into this . We should keep in touch with him .
Turn 1405, D (Professor): Yeah . Well , once we send out {disfmarker}
Turn 1406, H (Postdoc): Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1407, D (Professor): I mean , we still haven't sent out the first note saying " hey , this list exists " . But {disfmarker} but , uh , once we do that {disfmarker}
Turn 1408, A (Professor): Is that an action item ?
Turn 1409, D (Professor): Yeah . It 's on {disfmarker} I already added that one on my board to do that . So , uh {disfmarker} uh , hopefully everybody here is on that list . We should at least check that everybody here {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1410, G (Grad): I think everyone here is on the list .
Turn 1411, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1412, F (PhD): I 'm not .
Turn 1413, H (Postdoc): u e e
Turn 1414, G (Grad): I think you are .
Turn 1415, D (Professor): We haven't sent anything to the list yet .
Turn 1416, F (PhD): Oh ! OK .
Turn 1417, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1418, D (Professor): We 're just compiling the list .
Turn 1419, F (PhD): I see .
Turn 1420, G (Grad): I {disfmarker} I added a few people who didn't {disfmarker} who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me .
Turn 1421, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1422, E (PhD): Who specifically ask not to be .
Turn 1423, G (Grad): Like Jane , for example .
Turn 1424, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1425, G (Grad): You are on it , aren't you ?
Turn 1426, H (Postdoc): Yeah , I am .
Turn 1427, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1428, H (Postdoc): So , I w uh , just {disfmarker} just for clarification . So " found data " , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and {disfmarker} and other fields , right ?
Turn 1429, B (PhD): What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect ,
Turn 1430, H (Postdoc): It sounds like such a t
Turn 1431, B (PhD): and especially good {disfmarker}
Turn 1432, H (Postdoc): Yeah , OK .
Turn 1433, B (PhD): Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . It 's things occur without any {disfmarker} You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever .
Turn 1434, H (Postdoc): OK . But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and {pause} other fields .
Turn 1435, B (PhD): Mark 's aware of those , too .
Turn 1436, E (PhD): " Hey , look what we found ! "
Turn 1437, H (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 1438, B (PhD): That would be found data because they found it {vocalsound} and it exists .
Turn 1439, G (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 1440, H (Postdoc): Exactly .
Turn 1441, E (PhD): " I found this great corpora . " Yeah .
Turn 1442, B (PhD): They didn't have to collect it . Of course it 's not " found " in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose .
Turn 1443, G (Grad): " Psst . {comment} Want to buy a corpora ? "
Turn 1444, H (Postdoc): Yeah . OK , OK .
Turn 1445, B (PhD): But what he means is that {disfmarker} You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from {disfmarker} you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff ,
Turn 1446, H (Postdoc): That 's interesting .
Turn 1447, B (PhD): web stuff ,
Turn 1448, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1449, B (PhD): TV stuff , radio stuff . But he well understands that that 's very different than these {disfmarker} this type of meeting .
Turn 1450, G (Grad): It 's not the same .
Turn 1451, B (PhD): But , so what ? It 's still {disfmarker} it 's interesting for other reasons .
Turn 1452, H (Postdoc): OK . Yeah . Just wanted to know .
Turn 1453, D (Professor): So , seems like we 're winding down .
Turn 1454, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1455, D (Professor): Right ? Many {pause} ways .
Turn 1456, B (PhD): You can {pause} tell {pause} by the {pause} prosody .
Turn 1457, E (PhD): So we should go {disfmarker} go around and s
Turn 1458, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1459, E (PhD): We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ?
Turn 1460, A (Professor): Oh . Yes , we should do that .
Turn 1461, B (PhD): Rrrh !
Turn 1462, G (Grad): Now , I was already thinking about it , so {disfmarker}
Turn 1463, D (Professor): Oh ! Good man .
Turn 1464, B (PhD): This is painful task .
Turn 1465, C (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1466, B (PhD): I {disfmarker}
Turn 1467, G (Grad): So , um , I really liked the idea of {disfmarker} what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking . So , can you {pause} determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that {disfmarker} that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that .
Turn 1468, H (Postdoc): Well , I {disfmarker} I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , um , I {disfmarker} I found this discussion very , uh , i this {disfmarker} this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what {disfmarker} what that {disfmarker} what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of {disfmarker} of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . But that 's not really a specific fact . I just sort of thought we {disfmarker} we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile .
Turn 1469, E (PhD): I had a real revelation about taking pictures . I don't know why I didn't do this before and I regret it . So that was very interesting for me .
Turn 1470, H (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1471, G (Grad): Did you take pictures of the boards ?
Turn 1472, E (PhD): Not that I {disfmarker}
Turn 1473, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1474, E (PhD): The boards aren't really related to this meeting . I mean , I will take pictures of them , but {disfmarker}
Turn 1475, H (Postdoc): That 's a good point .
Turn 1476, A (Professor): They 're related to this morning 's meeting .
Turn 1477, E (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1478, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1479, G (Grad): To the pre previous meeting . That 's right .
Turn 1480, E (PhD): OK . Well , that 's why I 'll take pictures of them , then .
Turn 1481, F (PhD): I 'm gonna pass because I can't {disfmarker} I mean , of the {disfmarker} Jane took my answer .
Turn 1482, G (Grad): Ah !
Turn 1483, F (PhD): So .
Turn 1484, H (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 1485, F (PhD): Um , so I 'm gonna pass for the moment but y come {disfmarker} come back to me .
Turn 1486, E (PhD): For the moment .
Turn 1487, B (PhD): Pass .
Turn 1488, A (Professor): I think {disfmarker} I think " pass " is socially acceptable . But I will say {disfmarker} uh , I will actually {disfmarker} uh , a spin on different {disfmarker} slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that {disfmarker} that may be kind of the test {disfmarker} in a sense , test data , uh , the {disfmarker} the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .
Turn 1489, C (Professor): I agree with Jane and Eric . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project . But , um , {vocalsound} it 's definitely something I would {pause} want to do something on .
Turn 1490, G (Grad): I wonder if work 's already been done on it .
Turn 1491, H (Postdoc): Like e expert systems and stuff ,
Turn 1492, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 1493, H (Postdoc): or {disfmarker} ? Uh - huh .
Turn 1494, D (Professor): Well , being more management lately than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . That is , I {disfmarker} I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today . So that 's what really impressed me .
Turn 1495, E (PhD): How are we gonna find that in the data ?
Turn 1496, G (Grad): Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time {disfmarker}
Turn 1497, E (PhD): Oh , yeah .
Turn 1498, G (Grad): Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1499, F (PhD): Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot .
Turn 1500, E (PhD): Right .
Turn 1501, F (PhD): Right ? So .
Turn 1502, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1503, E (PhD): How happy were they ?
Turn 1504, D (Professor): I 'd probably search for something like that .
Turn 1505, G (Grad): That actually has come up a couple times in queries . I was talking to Landay
Turn 1506, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1507, G (Grad): and that was one of his examples .
Turn 1508, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1509, G (Grad): When {disfmarker} when did people laugh ?
Turn 1510, E (PhD): That 's great .
Turn 1511, D (Professor): Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . Yeah .
Turn 1512, G (Grad): So we need a laugh detector .
Turn 1513, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1514, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1515, E (PhD): Perfect .
Turn 1516, H (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1517, G (Grad): Cuz that seems to be pretty common . Not in the congressional hearings .
Turn 1518, F (PhD): No .
Turn 1519, G (Grad): Quiet sobbing .
Turn 1520, D (Professor): So I think we 're done .
Turn 1521, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1522, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 1523, A (Professor): Great .
Turn 1524, E (PhD): Great .
Turn 1525, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 1526, G (Grad): I think we 're done .
Turn 1527, D (Professor): Great .
Turn 1528, H (Postdoc):  h Do we need {disfmarker} do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 1529, D (Professor): Now these we turn off . Right ?
