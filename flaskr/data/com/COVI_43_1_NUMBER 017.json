The church is now a focal point of the Niagara Freedom Trail tour, which Wilma played a large role in helping to develop.\n              I last saw Wilma in February, and I can tell you that in meeting her you could not help but feel better because of the time you had spent together.

However, statistics show that indigenous peoples still have the highest rates of suicide, the poorest health outcomes and the most incarcerations, that visible minorities, despite education, are underemployed and underpaid, and that many black men are carded and suspected of criminality regularly.\n              Crisis brings anger and fear. It cracks the thin veneer of tolerance in quiet, polite times. COVID-19 exposed anti-Chinese hate and amplified the reality of black and indigenous lives. We are all shaken and empathetic, but our denial and ignorance can no longer stand. We must listen and act, collect disaggregated data and set goals with policies and programs to achieve them. \n              To build a strong, peaceful, prosperous nation, everyone must belong, and everyone must build it together."}, {"turn": 15, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Mr. Savard-Tremblay, you have the floor."}, {"turn": 16, "speakerID": "261793", "name": "Mr. Simon-Pierre Savard-Tremblay (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, the aerospace industry is a strategic sector that plays a fundamental role in the Quebec economy.

In addition, 80% of our production is exported. It should also be noted that 70% of Canadian research and development in the field is carried out in the greater Montreal area.\n              This pride is followed by great concern. Planes are on the ground, and orders have been cancelled. The aerospace industry has been hit hard by the Canadian stock market since the start of the year.
