Turn 0, C (PhD): What channel am I on ?
Turn 1, E (PhD): Channel .
Turn 2, C (PhD): Oh , channel two .
Turn 3, G (PhD): Make sure to turn your microphone on .
Turn 4, E (PhD): Channel .
Turn 5, G (PhD): There 's a battery .
Turn 6, B (Grad): There we go .
Turn 7, G (PhD): OK . Your channel number 's already on this blank sheet .
Turn 8, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 9, G (PhD): So you just {disfmarker} If you can {disfmarker}
Turn 10, F (Professor): Channel five ? Channel five .
Turn 11, E (PhD): Channel whatever .
Turn 12, F (Professor): I 'm on channel five .
Turn 13, B (Grad): Camera one , camera two .
Turn 14, E (PhD): What am I ?
Turn 15, F (Professor): Little low ?
Turn 16, E (PhD): Channel four ?
Turn 17, F (Professor): Channel five .
Turn 18, E (PhD): This number four ? OK .
Turn 19, F (Professor): Channel five . OK .
Turn 20, G (PhD): The gai the gain 's up at it {disfmarker} what it usually is ,
Turn 21, F (Professor): Is it ?
Turn 22, G (PhD): but if you think it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's sort of a default . But I can set it higher if you like .
Turn 23, F (Professor): Oh . Maybe it should be a little higher .
Turn 24, G (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 25, F (Professor): It 's not showing much . Test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test . OK , that {disfmarker} that seems better ? Yeah ? OK , good . Ah , that 's good , that 's good . That 's Ahh . Mmm . So I {disfmarker} I had a question for Adam . Have we started already ?
Turn 26, G (PhD): Well , we started recording , but {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 27, F (Professor): Yeah . Is Jane around or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 28, D (PhD): I saw her earlier .
Turn 29, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 30, D (PhD): I think {disfmarker}
Turn 31, G (PhD): She can just walk in , I guess , or {disfmarker}
Turn 32, D (PhD): Yeah . She 'll probably come up .
Turn 33, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 34, G (PhD): Since we 're starting late I figured we 'd better just start .
Turn 35, F (Professor): Yeah . Great idea . I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because {vocalsound} it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in {pause} mid July . Uh , but {vocalsound} I don't remember w what we {disfmarker} I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , but I thought there was a second thing . Anybody remember ?
Turn 36, G (PhD): Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought , that was totally separate from the interface . Do you remember ? Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , {vocalsound} but in a pre - stored fashion .
Turn 37, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Right .
Turn 38, G (PhD): That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber {disfmarker}
Turn 39, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 40, G (PhD): Come on in .
Turn 41, F (Professor): Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out and get somebody going on it cuz we 're {disfmarker} got a {disfmarker} got a month left basically . So .
Turn 42, G (PhD): You like these . Right ? OK , good .
Turn 43, F (Professor): OK . Um OK . So , what are we g else we got ? You got {disfmarker} you just wrote a bunch of stuff .
Turn 44, G (PhD): No . That was all , um , previously here .
Turn 45, F (Professor): Oh .
Turn 46, G (PhD): I was writing {pause} the digits and then I realized I could xerox them ,
Turn 47, F (Professor): Oh , oh .
Turn 48, G (PhD): because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones . So . We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record . So .
Turn 49, F (Professor): That 's cool .
Turn 50, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 51, F (Professor): So , the choice is , uh , which {disfmarker} which do we want more , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the comparison , uh , {vocalsound} of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that {disfmarker} ?
Turn 52, G (PhD): It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .
Turn 53, F (Professor): I know that . But , you know , which opportunity should we
Turn 54, G (PhD): So . Yeah .
Turn 55, C (PhD): Unison .
Turn 56, F (Professor): exploit ? {vocalsound} Unison .
Turn 57, G (PhD): I mean , it {disfmarker} Actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings . I mean , we could use them for normalizing or something , but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison .
Turn 58, F (Professor): I guess we 'll see
Turn 59, G (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 60, F (Professor): i I guess it 's dependent on
Turn 61, G (PhD): See how long we go .
Turn 62, F (Professor): how long we go and how good the snack is out there .
Turn 63, E (PhD): But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some {disfmarker} sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical .
Turn 64, F (Professor): Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence .
Turn 65, G (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 66, F (Professor): Yeah . We 'd have to train .
Turn 67, G (PhD): We 'd be like a chorus .
Turn 68, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 69, F (Professor): Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience .
Turn 70, C (PhD): Greek chorus .
Turn 71, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 72, G (PhD): Yes .
Turn 73, F (Professor): Yeah . Really {pause} boring chorus . Um . Do we {pause} have an agenda ? Adam usually tries to put those together , but he 's ill .
Turn 74, D (PhD): I 've got a couple of things to talk about .
Turn 75, F (Professor): So . Yeah . Uh ju what {disfmarker} what might those be ?
Turn 76, D (PhD): Uh , IBM stuff and , um , just getting {vocalsound} uh , meeting information organized .
Turn 77, F (Professor): Meeting info organized . OK . Um .
Turn 78, C (PhD): Are you implying that it 's currently disorganized ?
Turn 79, D (PhD): In my mind .
Turn 80, F (Professor): Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the {pause} SRI recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with {disfmarker} ?
Turn 81, C (PhD): Well .
Turn 82, F (Professor): Y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ?
Turn 83, C (PhD): We 're improving .
Turn 84, F (Professor): We 're improving .
Turn 85, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 86, D (PhD): Now the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC .
Turn 87, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 88, D (PhD): Right ?
Turn 89, C (PhD): Yeah . Actually it looks like it 's getting better .
Turn 90, F (Professor): Right . Oh .
Turn 91, C (PhD): So . But {disfmarker} but it 's not {disfmarker}
Turn 92, F (Professor): Just with {disfmarker} with age , kind of .
Turn 93, C (PhD): With age . Yeah .
Turn 94, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 95, C (PhD): But , uh , that 's not d directly related to me . Doesn't mean we can't talk about it . Um , it seems {disfmarker} It looks l I haven't {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} The experiment is still not complete , but , um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the {vocalsound} ICSI front - end .
Turn 96, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . That 's pretty funny .
Turn 97, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 98, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 99, G (PhD): So you just need to {pause} copy over to this one .
Turn 100, C (PhD): Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems .
Turn 101, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 102, F (Professor): Ah ! Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do .
Turn 103, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 104, F (Professor): OK . OK . Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 105, C (PhD): But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and {disfmarker} and Don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations .
Turn 106, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 107, C (PhD): Because in all our previous experiments , we had the {disfmarker} uh , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , um , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
Turn 108, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 109, C (PhD): And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should {pause} consider doing a {disfmarker}
Turn 110, E (PhD): Mmm . So .
Turn 111, B (Grad): Come on .
Turn 112, C (PhD): uh , doing {disfmarker}
Turn 113, E (PhD): Yeah . We {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Turn 114, F (Professor): Y think {disfmarker} you think we should increase the error rate .
Turn 115, E (PhD): Anyway . Yeah .
Turn 116, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 117, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 118, F (Professor): Good .
Turn 119, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 120, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 121, E (PhD): That - that 's what I wanted to do anyway ,
Turn 122, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 123, E (PhD): so we should just get together and {disfmarker}
Turn 124, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 125, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 126, G (PhD): And even {disfmarker} The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , {comment} even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,
Turn 127, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 128, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 129, G (PhD): but {vocalsound} I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're {disfmarker} we 're getting insertions in places what {disfmarker} that you may well be cutting out .
Turn 130, C (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 131, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 132, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 133, G (PhD): So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .
Turn 134, C (PhD): We should {disfmarker} we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the models for background noise to the {disfmarker} to this environment , for instance .
Turn 135, G (PhD): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 136, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 137, G (PhD): And , yeah , using Thilo 's , you know , posteriors or some kind of {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Turn 138, C (PhD): So .
Turn 139, G (PhD): right now they 're {disfmarker} they 're discrete ,
Turn 140, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 141, G (PhD): yes or no for a speaker , to consider those particular speaker background models .
Turn 142, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 143, G (PhD): So . There 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done .
Turn 144, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . We should do that .
Turn 145, G (PhD): So .
Turn 146, F (Professor): Good . So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ?
Turn 147, D (PhD): Yeah . So , um , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before .
Turn 148, F (Professor): You had some {pause} thing about that ? Right .
Turn 149, D (PhD): And so {disfmarker}
Turn 150, F (Professor): The , uh , Chuck chunks .
Turn 151, D (PhD): Yeah . The Chuck chunks .
Turn 152, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 153, D (PhD): Right . And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one
Turn 154, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 155, D (PhD): and that would help keep them from getting lost . And , um , {vocalsound} so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps
Turn 156, C (PhD): Where 'd you get the digits from ?
Turn 157, D (PhD): and so we 're {disfmarker} I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten .
Turn 158, A (Postdoc): They sound really good .
Turn 159, D (PhD): So . Does it sound OK ?
Turn 160, G (PhD): That 's a great idea .
Turn 161, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 162, D (PhD): So , um {disfmarker} Yeah . We just used those .
Turn 163, C (PhD): And do you splice them into the {pause} waveform ? Or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 164, D (PhD): Yeah . He {disfmarker} then he d I recorded {disfmarker} Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked .
Turn 165, C (PhD): Right . Mm - hmm .
Turn 166, D (PhD): He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out {vocalsound} and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps .
Turn 167, A (Postdoc): It sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . Really .
Turn 168, E (PhD): It will be funny uh {disfmarker}
Turn 169, A (Postdoc): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 170, D (PhD): Does it ?
Turn 171, E (PhD): It will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with {disfmarker} with your {pause} digits in ?
Turn 172, D (PhD): Yeah . With my {disfmarker}
Turn 173, A (Postdoc): Oh that 's right .
Turn 174, G (PhD): Oh , right .
Turn 175, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 176, A (Postdoc): Now actually ,
Turn 177, D (PhD): That 'll throw them ,
Turn 178, A (Postdoc): we 're {disfmarker} Are we handling {disfmarker} ?
Turn 179, D (PhD): huh ?
Turn 180, F (Professor): Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something .
Turn 181, D (PhD): Yeah . {comment} Huh ! Maybe . And she said it wasn't gonna {disfmarker} the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep . So for them it 'll be very quick
Turn 182, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 183, D (PhD): to {disfmarker} to put those in there {vocalsound} when they 're transcribing .
Turn 184, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 185, D (PhD): So , um , we {disfmarker} We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file . And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out . And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription .
Turn 186, F (Professor): OK . Do w do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} Do you have any idea of the turn - around on {disfmarker} on those steps you just said ?
Turn 187, G (PhD): Great .
Turn 188, D (PhD): Uh . Our s our {disfmarker} On our side ?
Turn 189, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 190, D (PhD): or including IBM 's ?
Turn 191, F (Professor): Including IBM 's .
Turn 192, D (PhD): Well , I don't know . The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks . Um , maybe even three .
Turn 193, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 194, D (PhD): Uh , that 's just the I B M side . Our side is quick . I mean , I {disfmarker} I don't know . How long does your {disfmarker} ?
Turn 195, E (PhD): It should @ @ be finished today or something . Yeah .
Turn 196, F (Professor): Well , I meant the overall thing .
Turn 197, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 198, F (Professor): e e u u {comment} The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . {vocalsound} Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers .
Turn 199, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 200, F (Professor): And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working .
Turn 201, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 202, F (Professor): And , uh , so it 'd be {disfmarker} It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could ,
Turn 203, D (PhD): Yeah . I {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I hope @ @ {comment} we can get a better estimate from this {pause} one that we send them .
Turn 204, F (Professor): and then {disfmarker}
Turn 205, D (PhD): So . Um .
Turn 206, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 207, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I don't know yet how long that 'll take .
Turn 208, F (Professor): Yeah . Um {disfmarker} I mean in particular I would {disfmarker} I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're into production mode , somehow {disfmarker}
Turn 209, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 210, F (Professor): You know , that we {disfmarker} we actually {vocalsound} have a stream going and we know how {disfmarker} how well it does and how {disfmarker} and how it operates .
Turn 211, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 212, F (Professor): I think that would {disfmarker} that would certainly be a {disfmarker} a very good thing to know .
Turn 213, D (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 214, F (Professor): OK . Uh . Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions .
Turn 215, A (Postdoc): OK . So , um , we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling " set one " , which was the s the set that I 've been , uh {disfmarker} OK , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . Right now they 're in the process of being edited . Um , the , um {disfmarker} Let 's see , I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will {disfmarker} because we 've had a lot of attrition . And that will bring our total to {disfmarker}
Turn 216, F (Professor): They die off after they do this for a while .
Turn 217, A (Postdoc): Yeah . Well , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's various things .
Turn 218, D (PhD): Burn - out .
Turn 219, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 220, A (Postdoc): So , one of them had a baby . Um , you know , one of them really w wasn't planning {disfmarker}
Turn 221, C (PhD): Oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of {disfmarker}
Turn 222, A (Postdoc): Eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past January . I mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in January and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Um , so it makes sense . Uh , through attrition we {disfmarker} we 've {disfmarker} we 're down to {disfmarker} to two , but they 're really solid . We 're really lucky the two that we kept . And , um {disfmarker} Well , I don't mean {disfmarker} I don't mean anything against the others . {comment} What I mean is we 've got a good cause {disfmarker} a good core . No . We had a good core {disfmarker}
Turn 223, G (PhD): Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting .
Turn 224, A (Postdoc): Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we {disfmarker} w we 're {disfmarker} we 've got , uh ,
Turn 225, F (Professor): No backs .
Turn 226, A (Postdoc): two of the ones who {disfmarker} who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a {disfmarker} a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this {disfmarker} within this coming week , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but the plan is {disfmarker} just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the {disfmarker} on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now ,
Turn 227, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 228, A (Postdoc): because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . So . And this way it 'll {disfmarker} I mean , I got really a lot of response for {disfmarker} for my notice and I think I could hire additional people if I {pause} wish to .
Turn 229, F (Professor): Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event {disfmarker} and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way {disfmarker} in the unlikely event that we actually find {vocalsound} that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , {vocalsound} all the stuff that {disfmarker} that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're {disfmarker} and they 're faster {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline is faster than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in {disfmarker} in the day {disfmarker} e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I {disfmarker} I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do .
Turn 230, A (Postdoc): Oh , yes .
Turn 231, F (Professor): So I {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we {disfmarker} if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . But {disfmarker} but , um {disfmarker} for all sorts of reasons {disfmarker} but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff {disfmarker} five or six on staff at any given time , then {vocalsound} it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way .
Turn 232, A (Postdoc): Good . OK .
Turn 233, F (Professor): Good .
Turn 234, G (PhD): It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more .
Turn 235, E (PhD): Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on , is , uh , to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now , and to {disfmarker} to use them as , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 236, G (PhD): Oh . Oh , the new ones
Turn 237, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 238, G (PhD): with the tighter boundaries . Yeah .
Turn 239, E (PhD): Yeah . And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever . Yeah . To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and {disfmarker} Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that 's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I 'm just looking into .
Turn 240, G (PhD): OK .
Turn 241, A (Postdoc): The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , uh , I g guess {disfmarker} So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker} f for just very few days you were away . But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,
Turn 242, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 243, A (Postdoc): so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um {disfmarker} you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um {disfmarker} Um . So they really appreciate it . But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while . You know , once in a while there 's something like ,
Turn 244, E (PhD): Yeah , sure .
Turn 245, A (Postdoc): um , and e Actually you talked to them . Didn't you ? Did you ? Have you {disfmarker} ?
Turn 246, E (PhD): Yeah . I talked to Helen .
Turn 247, A (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker} And so , I asked her {disfmarker} I mean , They 're very perceptive . I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um {disfmarker}
Turn 248, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 249, E (PhD): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 250, A (Postdoc): you know , I mean , you 're {disfmarker} You 're aware of this . But {disfmarker} but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver
Turn 251, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 252, A (Postdoc): and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . So .
Turn 253, G (PhD): That 's great .
Turn 254, A (Postdoc): Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these .
Turn 255, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 256, G (PhD): Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker}
Turn 257, A (Postdoc): You could do it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i
Turn 258, E (PhD): Yeah . Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that .
Turn 259, G (PhD): I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks
Turn 260, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 261, G (PhD): just so that if we run it we know whether we 're {disfmarker} which ones were cheating
Turn 262, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . That would be great , yeah , to know that .
Turn 263, G (PhD): and
Turn 264, A (Postdoc): There is a {disfmarker} there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version .
Turn 265, G (PhD): which one would be good .
Turn 266, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 267, A (Postdoc): So it 's not a pure {disfmarker} it 's not a pure condition . Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through .
Turn 268, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 269, A (Postdoc): And , um {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . But , it will be possible in the future
Turn 270, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 271, A (Postdoc): because we {disfmarker} we 're , um .
Turn 272, E (PhD): It would .
Turn 273, G (PhD): Mmm , that 's great .
Turn 274, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 275, G (PhD): Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original {pause} automatic one , we can always find out how well {pause} we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries .
Turn 276, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 277, G (PhD): Um .
Turn 278, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 279, G (PhD): You know , a completely non - cheating version .
Turn 280, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 281, G (PhD): Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to {disfmarker} for the transcribers {disfmarker} I could do it , or Chuck or Adam .
Turn 282, A (Postdoc): Thank you .
Turn 283, F (Professor): OK . So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ?
Turn 284, D (PhD): Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the {pause} directory structure for all of the meeting {disfmarker}
Turn 285, F (Professor): Did you record it ?
Turn 286, D (PhD): No . For all the Meeting Recorder data . We should have . Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . And then , Jane also s prepared a {disfmarker} um , started getting all of the {disfmarker} the meetings organized , so she prepared a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet {vocalsound} with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on .
Turn 287, G (PhD): Oh , great .
Turn 288, D (PhD): Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some {disfmarker} some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , but {vocalsound} so far , um , {vocalsound} as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . And , um {disfmarker} Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . Um , and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but I 've got a bunch of {disfmarker} uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have {disfmarker} have been completed and so forth . But , um , {vocalsound} this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the {disfmarker} the web site and people can {vocalsound} be informed of the status of various different ones . And {vocalsound} it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and {disfmarker} and there 's a place for comments , so we can , {vocalsound} um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . So .
Turn 289, F (Professor): Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed {disfmarker} we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and {disfmarker} um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of {disfmarker} of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for {disfmarker} approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ?
Turn 290, A (Postdoc): Um , interesting idea . In principle , I {disfmarker} I would say yes , although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version and it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there . So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Turn 291, F (Professor): Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the , uh , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline .
Turn 292, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 293, F (Professor): Um , we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July ,
Turn 294, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 295, F (Professor): and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker} given that we 've been {disfmarker} we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . Um .
Turn 296, A (Postdoc): It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah .
Turn 297, F (Professor): Right . So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say " here is a subset that is available right now "
Turn 298, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . That 's right .
Turn 299, F (Professor): and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth .
Turn 300, A (Postdoc): That 's right .
Turn 301, F (Professor): So .
Turn 302, A (Postdoc): Yeah . That 's right . So that {disfmarker}
Turn 303, F (Professor): OK ?
Turn 304, A (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 305, F (Professor): So , by {disfmarker} before July .
Turn 306, C (PhD): And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version
Turn 307, A (Postdoc): Well , maybe {disfmarker}
Turn 308, F (Professor): Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we
Turn 309, C (PhD): Bu Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if {disfmarker} if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they won't change the {disfmarker} the content of the meetings .
Turn 310, D (PhD): Content , really .
Turn 311, A (Postdoc): Well , see , this is the {disfmarker} this is the issue . Subtleties .
Turn 312, C (PhD): So .
Turn 313, G (PhD): Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ?
Turn 314, A (Postdoc): The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ {comment} could 've been transcribed in the other way .
Turn 315, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 316, G (PhD): Thing {disfmarker}
Turn 317, A (Postdoc): And no and they wouldn't have {vocalsound} been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ?
Turn 318, F (Professor): I it {disfmarker} you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know {disfmarker} this document now ? " So {disfmarker} So I think what it is is that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that they sign {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says " OK , from now on {disfmarker} you know , now that I 've read this , you can use {disfmarker} do anything you want with these data . "
Turn 319, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 320, F (Professor): And , uh {disfmarker} But , i I think we wanna {disfmarker} So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember , {vocalsound} um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're {disfmarker}
Turn 321, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . I agree . Mmm . I totally agree . It 's just , uh , a question of , {vocalsound} uh , if {disfmarker} if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous , {vocalsound} then it seems like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting .
Turn 322, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 323, A (Postdoc): Because it becomes , eh , in a way a {disfmarker} a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that .
Turn 324, F (Professor): Well , I forget how we end Right . I forget how we ended up on this , but I remember my taking the position {vocalsound} of not making it so {disfmarker} so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of {disfmarker} of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , but {disfmarker}
Turn 325, A (Postdoc): Well , {vocalsound} if it 's only the transcript , though {disfmarker} I mean , th this {disfmarker} this is my point , that {disfmarker} that
Turn 326, F (Professor): uh , the {disfmarker} Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up .
Turn 327, A (Postdoc): then it becomes {disfmarker}
Turn 328, F (Professor): That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it {disfmarker}
Turn 329, A (Postdoc): Well , if it 's just the audio {disfmarker} Well .
Turn 330, F (Professor): that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . That 's what Adam wanted .
Turn 331, A (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 332, F (Professor): And I don't remember how we ended up .
Turn 333, G (PhD): I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . And , I mean , I would say " no " . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really {vocalsound} interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that .
Turn 334, F (Professor): You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were {disfmarker}
Turn 335, G (PhD): Well , {vocalsound} I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j {vocalsound} Um , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed {disfmarker}
Turn 336, F (Professor): They disappeared from view .
Turn 337, G (PhD): Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people {vocalsound} probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if {disfmarker} if those change . Cuz assumi {vocalsound} assuming we {disfmarker} we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway .
Turn 338, C (PhD): Tha That 's {disfmarker} How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ?
Turn 339, G (PhD): Oh , my God .
Turn 340, A (Postdoc): That would be simpler ,
Turn 341, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 342, A (Postdoc): if we could count on them listening .
Turn 343, G (PhD): But no one will listen to the hours and hours of {disfmarker}
Turn 344, D (PhD): Talk .
Turn 345, C (PhD): Well , that 's O K .
Turn 346, B (Grad): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 347, C (PhD): We just have to give them a chance to listen to it , and if they don't , that 's their problem .
Turn 348, B (Grad): hmm , hmm .
Turn 349, G (PhD): You {disfmarker} you d That 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 350, A (Postdoc): Unfortunately , uh , in {disfmarker} in the sign thing that they signed , it says " transcripts " .
Turn 351, C (PhD): No , I 'm serious .
Turn 352, A (Postdoc): " You 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . "
Turn 353, C (PhD): Really ?
Turn 354, B (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 355, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 356, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 357, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 358, G (PhD): I I {disfmarker} I think
Turn 359, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 360, G (PhD): that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings .
Turn 361, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 362, F (Professor): W anyway , haven't we {disfmarker} we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and {disfmarker} and not really get anywhere , so let {disfmarker} let me just suggest that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July .
Turn 363, A (Postdoc): Yes .
Turn 364, F (Professor): OK . So {disfmarker} so that in July we can tell people {vocalsound} " yes , we have this and you can use it " .
Turn 365, A (Postdoc): Yes . It 's done , ready , available . Good .
Turn 366, F (Professor): Uh . So , let 's see . What else we got ? Uh . Don did {disfmarker} did a report about his project in class and , uh {disfmarker} an oral and written {disfmarker} written version .
Turn 367, G (PhD): Well .
Turn 368, F (Professor): So that was stuff he was doing with you . Yeah .
Turn 369, G (PhD): I mean , it 's {disfmarker} I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount {disfmarker} We have eight meetings there because we couldn't use the non - native {disfmarker} all non - native meetings and {vocalsound} it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the {vocalsound} prosodic features are {pause} very noisy and so you {disfmarker} you need a lot of data in order to model them . Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with , {vocalsound} I don't know , double or triple the data {disfmarker} with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the {vocalsound} distance of , um , {vocalsound} boundaries from peaks in the utterance and {vocalsound} some {pause} local , um , range {disfmarker} pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . Um , so these are based on forced alignment . Word features like , um , word frequency and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns .
Turn 370, F (Professor): So the dominant features , including everything , were those {disfmarker} those quasi - cheating things . Right ? Where these are {disfmarker}
Turn 371, B (Grad): Sometimes not .
Turn 372, G (PhD): I think it depends what you 're looking at , a actually .
Turn 373, B (Grad): Yeah . Sometimes {pause} positions in sentences obviously , or in spurts , was helpful . I don't know if that 's cheating , too .
Turn 374, G (PhD): Right . Um ,
Turn 375, C (PhD): Spurts wouldn't be . Right ?
Turn 376, G (PhD): spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words ,
Turn 377, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 378, G (PhD): but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position .
Turn 379, B (Grad): Right . Would they give you the same number of words , though ?
Turn 380, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 381, G (PhD): It 's either early or late .
Turn 382, C (PhD): No
Turn 383, G (PhD): Not exactly , but i
Turn 384, B (Grad): But ra somewhat ?
Turn 385, F (Professor): On the average .
Turn 386, G (PhD): Y yeah it should be . Well , we don't know and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of {disfmarker}
Turn 387, F (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 388, C (PhD): Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ?
Turn 389, G (PhD): So .
Turn 390, B (Grad): I think ti uh {disfmarker} Just p time position , like when the word starts ?
Turn 391, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 392, B (Grad): I don't know if that was in the {disfmarker}
Turn 393, C (PhD): Well , no , I mean t time {disfmarker} time position relative to the beginning of the spurt .
Turn 394, G (PhD): Eh {disfmarker} You know , uh
Turn 395, B (Grad): Start .
Turn 396, G (PhD): Yeah ,
Turn 397, B (Grad): Yeah . There 's all these things to do .
Turn 398, G (PhD): uh , we didn't try it , but it 's s
Turn 399, B (Grad): Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out .
Turn 400, C (PhD): Yeah . I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause {pause} pretty well within the time .
Turn 401, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 402, G (PhD): Right .
Turn 403, F (Professor): How about time position normalized by speak
Turn 404, G (PhD): And it depends on speaking rate {disfmarker}
Turn 405, F (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Turn 406, G (PhD): speaking rate . Yeah .
Turn 407, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 408, G (PhD): Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first .
Turn 409, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 410, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 411, G (PhD): But we {disfmarker} one of the interesting things was I guess you reported on some te punctuation type {disfmarker}
Turn 412, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 413, G (PhD): finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , so where {disfmarker} you know , if I 'm talking now and someone {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . And there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing {disfmarker} even though the word features were available . And a neat thing there too is I tried some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} putting the speaker {disfmarker} So , I gave everybody {vocalsound} a short version of their name . So the real names are in there , which we couldn't use . Uh , we should use I Ds or something . And those don't show up . So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person ,
Turn 414, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 415, G (PhD): um , but was sort of trying to , {vocalsound} uh , get a general idea {disfmarker} the model {disfmarker} the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , even though there are huge speaker effects . So . The {disfmarker} but the main limitation now is I {disfmarker} because we 're only looking at things that happen every {vocalsound} ten words or every twenty words , we need more {disfmarker} more data and more data per speaker . So . It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter {vocalsound} to {pause} interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings .
Turn 416, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 417, G (PhD): And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,
Turn 418, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 419, G (PhD): which is {vocalsound} not bad . It 'd probably do better than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um , but it wasn't generalizing .
Turn 420, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 421, G (PhD): So it 's {disfmarker} And I think Don , um {disfmarker} Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , where we can {disfmarker} And he 'll be able to report on more things {pause} in the future . But it was great that we could at least go from the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , Jane 's transcripts and the , {vocalsound} uh , recognizer output and get it {pause} to this point . And I think it 's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report {disfmarker} like , " yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just {vocalsound} reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that {vocalsound} some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . " The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard . And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes , cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than {disfmarker} than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth .
Turn 422, C (PhD): W wh wh wh Better in what sense ?
Turn 423, G (PhD): Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than {disfmarker} than Switchboard and there 's a lot less dropout , so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring {vocalsound} are completely devoid of pitch information ,
Turn 424, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . 
Turn 425, G (PhD): in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for , you know , five word
Turn 426, F (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 427, G (PhD): there are much fewer than in Switchboard . So the missing {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard and , so the features weren't as reliable cuz they were often just not available .
Turn 428, D (PhD): Could it have to do with the {disfmarker} the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ?
Turn 429, G (PhD): So that 's actually good . Ma - maybe . I mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it .
Turn 430, D (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 431, G (PhD): So we 're just getting better signals in {disfmarker} in this data . Which is nice . So .
Turn 432, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 433, G (PhD): Anyway , Don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , um , Andreas 's help and also some of Thilo 's help on this ,
Turn 434, F (Professor): Great .
Turn 435, E (PhD): Y
Turn 436, G (PhD): to {disfmarker} to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work .
Turn 437, E (PhD): Yeah . Sure . Yeah .
Turn 438, F (Professor): Has {disfmarker} has , uh {disfmarker} ? We just {disfmarker} I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has {disfmarker} has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the {disfmarker} with the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , using the tandem system input for the {disfmarker} ?
Turn 439, C (PhD): Oh , yeah . I tried that . It didn't , um , help dramatically . The {disfmarker}
Turn 440, D (PhD): Were they out of balance ? I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't notice .
Turn 441, C (PhD): There were a little {disfmarker} the relative number of {disfmarker} I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually .
Turn 442, F (Professor): Oh .
Turn 443, C (PhD): So , you , uh {disfmarker} So , actually it {disfmarker} it preferred to have a positive {disfmarker} er , negative insertion penalty ,
Turn 444, G (PhD): Deletions ?
Turn 445, C (PhD): which means {vocalsound} that , um {disfmarker}
Turn 446, F (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 447, C (PhD): But , you know , it didn't change {vocalsound} th the {disfmarker} by adjusting that {disfmarker} the , um {disfmarker}
Turn 448, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 449, C (PhD): Yeah . The error changed by probably one percent or so . But , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a {disfmarker}
Turn 450, F (Professor): OK . So that {disfmarker} So that 's {disfmarker} So that 's not the problem .
Turn 451, C (PhD): That 's not the problem . No .
Turn 452, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 453, C (PhD): But , uh , we s just , um , uh {disfmarker} you know , Chuck and I talked and the {pause} @ @ {comment} next thing to do is probably to tune the {disfmarker} um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @ {comment} to {disfmarker} to this {disfmarker} to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all . We just used the same {vocalsound} configuration as we used for the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the standard system .
Turn 454, F (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 455, C (PhD): And , {vocalsound} for instance , uh , Dan {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , um , {vocalsound} something like ten Gaussians per cluster {disfmarker} You know , each {disfmarker} each mixture has ten {pause} Gaussians
Turn 456, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Hmm . We 're using sixty - four ,
Turn 457, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} and we 're using sixty - four ,
Turn 458, D (PhD): right ?
Turn 459, C (PhD): so that 's {vocalsound} obviously a big difference
Turn 460, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 461, C (PhD): and it might be way off and give very poorly trained , uh , you know , Gaussians that way ,
Turn 462, F (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 463, C (PhD): uh , an and poorly trained mixture weights . So {disfmarker} so , we have {disfmarker} The turn - around time on the training when we train only the {disfmarker} a male system with , uh , you know , our small training set , is {vocalsound} less than twenty - four hours , so we can run lots of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , basically just brute force , try a whole bunch of different um , settings .
Turn 464, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 465, C (PhD): And , uh , with the new machines it 'll be even better . So .
Turn 466, F (Professor): Yeah . We get twelve of those ,
Turn 467, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 468, F (Professor): huh ?
Turn 469, C (PhD): But the PLP features work {disfmarker} um , uh , you know , continue to improve the ,
Turn 470, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 471, C (PhD): um {disfmarker} As I said before , the {disfmarker} uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . So , um , @ @ {comment} I ran one experiment where we 're just {vocalsound} did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data ,
Turn 472, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 473, C (PhD): so I didn't bother to retrain {pause} the models at all , and it improved by one percent , which is about what we get with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , with , you know , just @ @ {comment} actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , with the standard system . So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the {disfmarker} for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and {disfmarker} So , that might even improve it further .
Turn 474, F (Professor): Great .
Turn 475, C (PhD): So , it looks like the P L - fea P features {comment} do very well now with {disfmarker} after having figured out all these little tricks to {disfmarker} to get it to work .
Turn 476, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 477, C (PhD): So .
Turn 478, F (Professor): Good .
Turn 479, G (PhD): Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ?
Turn 480, C (PhD): Exactly . Yeah .
Turn 481, G (PhD): OK .
Turn 482, F (Professor): Yeah . OK . So then {disfmarker} then we 'll have our baseline to {disfmarker} to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with .
Turn 483, C (PhD): Right . a Right . And {disfmarker} and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard {pause} MLP isn't trained on very good features .
Turn 484, F (Professor): But {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 485, C (PhD): Uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did Hub - five stuff , which didn't have any of the {disfmarker}
Turn 486, F (Professor): Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent .
Turn 487, C (PhD): Uh .
Turn 488, F (Professor): Right ? I mean , y the {disfmarker}
Turn 489, C (PhD): Well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now .
Turn 490, F (Professor): Add {pause} all of them . I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight .
Turn 491, C (PhD): Yeah . And now we have another percent with the V T
Turn 492, F (Professor): That 's three point three .
Turn 493, C (PhD): Um , actually , and it 's ,  um , What 's actually qu interesting is that with {disfmarker} um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , {vocalsound} uh , the N best lists , uh , and optimizing the weights , um , uh than {disfmarker}
Turn 494, D (PhD): Than you do with the standard ?
Turn 495, C (PhD): Yeah . So {disfmarker}
Turn 496, F (Professor): Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing {disfmarker} putting VTLN in or something is {disfmarker} it was a couple percent .
Turn 497, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 498, F (Professor): Right ? It was {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . So {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} let me see if I remember what they were . One of them {vocalsound} was , uh , the change to , uh {disfmarker} because it did it all at once , {comment} to {disfmarker} uh , from bark scale to mel scale ,
Turn 499, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 500, F (Professor): which I really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ {comment} they 're essentially the same scale but the {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place .
Turn 501, G (PhD): Yeah . Why did that cha ?
Turn 502, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 503, F (Professor): So that 's why I wanted to look {disfmarker} I still haven't looked at it yet . I {disfmarker} I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two ,
Turn 504, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 505, F (Professor): and it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub {vocalsound} one kilohertz band
Turn 506, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 507, F (Professor): and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other .
Turn 508, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 509, F (Professor): Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I don't know it yet . And the other {disfmarker} and the other {disfmarker} that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was {disfmarker} what was the other thing ?
Turn 510, D (PhD): Well , that was combined with the triangular . Right ?
Turn 511, F (Professor): Yeah . Those {disfmarker} those two were together .
Turn 512, D (PhD): Yeah . Right .
Turn 513, F (Professor): We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . But then there was a point eight percent which was something else .
Turn 514, D (PhD): The low - frequency cut - off .
Turn 515, F (Professor): Do you remember the {disfmarker} ? Oh , yeah . So that was {disfmarker} that was , uh {disfmarker} that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . So that someone e until someone else fixed it , which is that , um , I never put {disfmarker} when I u We had some problems before with offsets . This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal .
Turn 516, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 517, F (Professor): So we {disfmarker} we had , uh {disfmarker} ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data {disfmarker} in those data and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and nobody happened to mention it to us ,
Turn 518, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 519, F (Professor): and we were getting these , like , really terrible results , like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned " uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . " I said " what offsets ? "
Turn 520, B (Grad): 
Turn 521, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 522, F (Professor): And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen {comment} and wroop !
Turn 523, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 524, F (Professor): there 's this big DC offset . So , um , in PLP
Turn 525, G (PhD): There was a {disfmarker} like a hum or some or {disfmarker} when they recorded it ?
Turn 526, F (Professor): No . It 's just , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not at all uncommon for {disfmarker} for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .
Turn 527, G (PhD): Or just {disfmarker} ? Huh .
Turn 528, F (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , no big deal . It 's {disfmarker} you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . We had {disfmarker} we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a {disfmarker} a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,
Turn 529, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 530, F (Professor): like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . We had something more fancy . It was later on it didn't have that . So at that point I reali " oh sh we better have a {disfmarker} have a high - pass filter " just , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} just take care of the problem . So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety {disfmarker} ninety hertz or so {vocalsound} uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . And I never put anything in to adjust it for different {disfmarker} different sampling rates . And so {disfmarker} well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} instead of at ninety .
Turn 531, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 532, F (Professor): So , um , I don't know if Dan fixed it or {disfmarker} or , uh , what he {disfmarker}
Turn 533, C (PhD): Well , he made it a parameter .
Turn 534, F (Professor): He made it a parameter . So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it and then {disfmarker} and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , which is great .
Turn 535, D (PhD): What {disfmarker} what is the parameter ?
Turn 536, F (Professor): He had a {disfmarker}
Turn 537, D (PhD): Is it , uh , just the f lower cut - off that you want ?
Turn 538, C (PhD): It 's called , uh , {vocalsound} H - HPF .
Turn 539, F (Professor): H {disfmarker} Yeah . Does HPF on {disfmarker} on his feat feature .
Turn 540, C (PhD): u And {disfmarker} but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off .
Turn 541, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Oh , OK .
Turn 542, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 543, C (PhD): So .
Turn 544, F (Professor): I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either ,
Turn 545, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 546, F (Professor): so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is {vocalsound} another old {disfmarker} old bug of mine .
Turn 547, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 548, F (Professor): But , um {disfmarker} Um . So that {disfmarker} that was the problem there was th we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz
Turn 549, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 550, F (Professor): and it just wasn't doing it , so now it is . So , {vocalsound} that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . It {pause} still wasn't a big deal .
Turn 551, C (PhD): OK . Well , but , um {disfmarker} Well , uh , again , after completing the {pause} current experiments , we 'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can add up all the uh differences
Turn 552, F (Professor): Oh , yeah .
Turn 553, C (PhD): and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} an
Turn 554, F (Professor): But {disfmarker} but , I guess my {disfmarker} my point was that {disfmarker} that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways .
Turn 555, C (PhD): Y Right .
Turn 556, F (Professor): And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a competitive system . But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se . I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this .
Turn 557, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 558, F (Professor): Uh , unless you call {disfmarker} well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . But that 's sort of more both , kind of .
Turn 559, D (PhD): One experiment we should {disfmarker} we 'll probably need to do though when {disfmarker} um , at some point , is , since we 're using that same {disfmarker} the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain ,
Turn 560, F (Professor): Right ? But .
Turn 561, C (PhD): Well , that 's what I meant , in fact . Yeah .
Turn 562, D (PhD): yeah , yeah , for the tandem . You know , so we can see if it {disfmarker} what effect it has on the tandem processing .
Turn 563, C (PhD): So {disfmarker} so , the thing is {disfmarker} is do we expect {disfmarker} ?
Turn 564, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 565, C (PhD): eh At this point I 'm as I mean , you know {disfmarker} e I 'm wondering is it {disfmarker} Can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained {disfmarker} you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of {pause} parameters ?
Turn 566, F (Professor): Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes . Right ? So , it 's {disfmarker} so , um , um {disfmarker}
Turn 567, D (PhD): So , we {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} but we may not . I mean , if it doesn't perform as well , we may not know why . Right ? Cuz we need to do the exact experiment .
Turn 568, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 569, F (Professor): I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . So . Um . Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and {disfmarker} and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it {pause} gives you a transformational capability {vocalsound} for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth ,
Turn 570, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 571, F (Professor): and allows you to feed them to the other system with this {disfmarker} through this funnel . Um , so I think {disfmarker} I think that 's the real power of it . I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements . Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better .
Turn 572, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 573, F (Professor): If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 574, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 575, D (PhD): So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was , so @ @ {comment} in the first experiment that he did {vocalsound} we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP .
Turn 576, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 577, D (PhD): But one thing we could do is {disfmarker}
Turn 578, F (Professor): Let {disfmarker} let me {disfmarker} let me just ask you something . When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity {pause} outputs
Turn 579, D (PhD): Yeah . Through the regular tandem outputs .
Turn 580, F (Professor): and they 're {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} through the KLT .
Turn 581, D (PhD): Through the KLT . All that kinda stuff .
Turn 582, F (Professor): OK . And so {disfmarker} so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT
Turn 583, D (PhD): That 's what we did .
Turn 584, F (Professor): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 585, D (PhD): Right ? So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that {disfmarker}
Turn 586, F (Professor): OK . Yes .
Turn 587, D (PhD): so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were {vocalsound} standard features .
Turn 588, F (Professor): Yes . Yeah .
Turn 589, D (PhD): I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to {disfmarker} ?
Turn 590, F (Professor): Uh . Talk with Stephane . He did some things like that . It was either him or Carmen . I forget .
Turn 591, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 592, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 593, F (Professor): I mean these were all different databases and different {disfmarker} you know , in HTK and all that ,
Turn 594, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 595, F (Professor): so i it {disfmarker} it may not apply . But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .
Turn 596, D (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 597, F (Professor): But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components .
Turn 598, D (PhD): Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features ,
Turn 599, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 600, D (PhD): so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more .
Turn 601, F (Professor): Which could be good or not .
Turn 602, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 603, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . Worth trying .
Turn 604, C (PhD): But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems {vocalsound} debugged now and {disfmarker} I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features {disfmarker} uh , either generating them or feeding them to this {disfmarker} to the {vocalsound} SRI system ,
Turn 605, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 606, C (PhD): but it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 607, F (Professor): There might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference .
Turn 608, C (PhD): Yeah . And I 'm wondering how we can {disfmarker} how we can debug that .
Turn 609, F (Professor): But
Turn 610, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 611, C (PhD): I mean how {disfmarker} Um .
Turn 612, F (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 613, C (PhD): I 'm actually f quite sure that the {disfmarker} feeding the {pause} features into the system and training it up ,
Turn 614, F (Professor): What if {disfmarker} ?
Turn 615, C (PhD): that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features . And that 's obviously working great . So . I um .
Turn 616, D (PhD): Yeah . There could be a bug in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} somewhere before that .
Turn 617, C (PhD): There {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ?
Turn 618, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 619, C (PhD): Right ? We to
Turn 620, F (Professor): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 621, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 622, F (Professor): well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .
Turn 623, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 624, F (Professor): These nets are trained with particular normalization and when that gets screwed up it {disfmarker} it can really hurt it .
Turn 625, D (PhD): I 'm doing what Eric {disfmarker} E Eric coached me through then {disfmarker} that part of it , so I 'm pretty confident in that .
Turn 626, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 627, D (PhD): I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated from the original {comment} PLP ,
Turn 628, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 629, D (PhD): which is right .
Turn 630, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 631, D (PhD): N Yeah . So , I u I do {disfmarker} Oh , we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP , do we ? For the st just the straight PLP features ?
Turn 632, C (PhD): No . The {disfmarker} the SRI system does it .
Turn 633, D (PhD): S R I system does that . Right .
Turn 634, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 635, F (Professor): Right . Well , you might e e
Turn 636, C (PhD): So , there 's {disfmarker} there is {disfmarker} there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,
Turn 637, D (PhD): So that 's {disfmarker} that 's another {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 638, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 639, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 640, F (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I would actually double check with Stephane at this point ,
Turn 641, C (PhD): but {disfmarker}
Turn 642, F (Professor): cuz he 's probably the one here {disfmarker} I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem
Turn 643, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 644, F (Professor): thing and there may {disfmarker} there may be some little bit here and there that is not {disfmarker} not being handled right .
Turn 645, D (PhD): Yeah . It 's hard with features , cuz you don't know what they should look like . I mean , you can't just , like , print the {disfmarker} the values out in ASCII and , you know , look at them , see if they 're {disfmarker}
Turn 646, F (Professor): Not unless you had a lot of time
Turn 647, G (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 648, F (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 649, G (PhD): eh , and also they 're not {disfmarker} I mean , as I understand it , you {disfmarker} you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . Right ?
Turn 650, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 651, G (PhD): I mean , these are just discriminative , but they 're not , um , optimized for the final {disfmarker}
Turn 652, C (PhD): They 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for {disfmarker}
Turn 653, G (PhD): Right . So it {disfmarker} there 's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually {disfmarker} that you 're actually {disfmarker}
Turn 654, F (Professor): That 's right . Well , the other {disfmarker} Yeah , th the {disfmarker}
Turn 655, C (PhD): Mm - Mmm .
Turn 656, F (Professor): Well , you actually are . But {disfmarker} but it {disfmarker} but in an indirect way .
Turn 657, G (PhD): Well , right . It 's indirect , so you don't know {disfmarker}
Turn 658, F (Professor): So wha w what {disfmarker} an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . So , what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} what you do in the full procedure {vocalsound} is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . So in fact you {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . You can prove that it 's {disfmarker} it 's a , uh {disfmarker} If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh {disfmarker} by training up on local {disfmarker} local , uh {disfmarker} local frames . But , um , we aren't actually doing that here , because we did {disfmarker} we did that for a hybrid system , and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it isn't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i i it wouldn't quite apply here .
Turn 659, C (PhD): Do y
Turn 660, D (PhD): So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those .
Turn 661, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 662, G (PhD): Mmm , uh {disfmarker} Exactly . Exactly .
Turn 663, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 664, G (PhD): So that you can optimize it for the word error .
Turn 665, C (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 666, F (Professor): Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .
Turn 667, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 668, F (Professor): So that would save a lot of time .
Turn 669, C (PhD): And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets . So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what {disfmarker}
Turn 670, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 671, F (Professor): Yeah . Actually all those things could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could , uh {disfmarker} could affect it as well .
Turn 672, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 673, F (Professor): The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane {disfmarker} this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply {vocalsound} here , given all these things we 're mentioning . Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . Um , however , there 's times when it {pause} is not good . Uh , when {pause} something about the test set is different enough from the training set that {disfmarker} that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is not a good one .
Turn 674, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 675, F (Professor): So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , {vocalsound} uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .
Turn 676, C (PhD): Oh , we already talked about that .
Turn 677, G (PhD): Yeah . That {disfmarker}
Turn 678, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 679, C (PhD): El
Turn 680, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 681, G (PhD): Didn't you {disfmarker} did you {pause} do that already
Turn 682, C (PhD): Yeah . No , but we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker} when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there .
Turn 683, G (PhD): or {disfmarker} ? Oh . That makes a lot of sense . Huh .
Turn 684, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,
Turn 685, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 686, F (Professor): but actually Stephane did it
Turn 687, C (PhD): Uh - huh . And i does it help ?
Turn 688, F (Professor): and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and it helped a lot .
Turn 689, C (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 690, F (Professor): Yeah . So that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's our current best {disfmarker} best system in the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , in the Aurora thing .
Turn 691, C (PhD): Oh . OK .
Turn 692, G (PhD): Yeah . That makes sense .
Turn 693, C (PhD): And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ?
Turn 694, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 695, G (PhD): As {disfmarker} you should never do worse .
Turn 696, F (Professor): I {disfmarker} I , uh , missed what you said .
Turn 697, C (PhD): Do you {disfmarker} d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ?
Turn 698, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 699, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 700, F (Professor): Well , actually , I , uh {disfmarker} you should check with him , because he tried several different combinations .
Turn 701, C (PhD): Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction .
Turn 702, F (Professor): Yeah . I , uh , th what I don't remember is which came out best . So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT , and another one , since the {disfmarker} the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and {disfmarker} and just did a KLT on the {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} on the net outputs
Turn 703, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mmm .
Turn 704, F (Professor): and then concatenated that . And I don't remember which was better .
Turn 705, D (PhD): Did he {disfmarker} did he try to {disfmarker} ? So he always ended up with a feature vector that was {pause} twice as long as either one of the {disfmarker} ?
Turn 706, F (Professor): No . I don't know , i I {disfmarker} I don't know . You have to check with him .
Turn 707, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 708, C (PhD): OK . Actually , I have to run .
Turn 709, F (Professor): I 'm into big ideas these days .
Turn 710, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 711, C (PhD): Uh .
Turn 712, G (PhD): We need to close up cuz I need to save the data and , um , get a call .
Turn 713, F (Professor): Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks . Yeah .
Turn 714, G (PhD): Right .
Turn 715, F (Professor): Uh
Turn 716, G (PhD): Did people wanna do the digits
Turn 717, F (Professor): Um .
Turn 718, G (PhD): or , um , do them together ?
Turn 719, F (Professor): I {disfmarker} I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together .
Turn 720, G (PhD): I don't know . Should we just {disfmarker} ? OK . I mean , are we trying to do them {nonvocalsound} in synchrony ? That might be fun .
Turn 721, F (Professor): Well , it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} You know , it 's not gonna work out
Turn 722, G (PhD): Adam 's not here , so he 's not here to tell me no .
Turn 723, F (Professor): but we could {disfmarker} we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm , you know , what {disfmarker}
Turn 724, G (PhD): Sure .
Turn 725, F (Professor): Uh , O 's or zeroes , we wanna agree on that ?
Turn 726, G (PhD): Maybe just whatever people would naturally do ? I don't know .
Turn 727, F (Professor): Oh , but if we were a singing group , we would wanna decide . Right ?
Turn 728, G (PhD): Be harmony . Yeah . {comment} Yeah .
Turn 729, A (Postdoc): Mine 's identical to yours .
Turn 730, F (Professor): We might wa
Turn 731, A (Postdoc): Is that correct ?
Turn 732, G (PhD): Sorry . So I set up and we didn't have {pause} enough digit forms
Turn 733, A (Postdoc): Oh . I see .
Turn 734, F (Professor): So these are excellent .
Turn 735, G (PhD): so I xeroxed the same one seven times .
Turn 736, A (Postdoc): Oh . I see .
Turn 737, F (Professor): Why don't we do zer i Anyone have a problem with saying zero ? Is zero OK ?
Turn 738, G (PhD): No .
Turn 739, A (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 740, F (Professor): OK . One and a two and three .
Turn 741, G (PhD): e
Turn 742, F (Professor): Once more with feeling .
Turn 743, G (PhD): And th
Turn 744, F (Professor): No , just k just kidding . Oh , yeah . It was .
