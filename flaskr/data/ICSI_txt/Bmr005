Turn 0, E (Professor): So . OK . Doesn't look like it crashed . That 's great .
Turn 1, G (Grad): So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I won't do that anymore .
Turn 2, B (Postdoc): And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?
Turn 3, A (PhD): Sounds like an initialization thing .
Turn 4, B (Postdoc): I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}
Turn 5, G (Grad): No .
Turn 6, B (Postdoc): I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?
Turn 7, G (Grad): I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .
Turn 8, B (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 9, C (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 10, G (Grad): So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .
Turn 11, E (Professor): And start by giving the transcript number .
Turn 12, A (PhD): Tran
Turn 13, D (PhD): Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .
Turn 14, A (PhD): Oh sorry , go ahead .
Turn 15, E (Professor): So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .
Turn 16, H (Grad): OK .
Turn 17, E (Professor): It 's just uh {disfmarker}
Turn 18, H (Grad): Umh .
Turn 19, E (Professor): Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .
Turn 20, G (Grad): And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,
Turn 21, E (Professor): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some
Turn 22, G (Grad): but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them .
Turn 23, E (Professor): Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker} Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events " but I think , you know , what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else
Turn 24, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 25, E (Professor): like some other noise .
Turn 26, D (PhD): Uh - huh . Yeah .
Turn 27, E (Professor): Yes ? You mean that as an event also .
Turn 28, D (PhD): To
Turn 29, E (Professor): So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that
Turn 30, D (PhD): right .
Turn 31, E (Professor): and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .
Turn 32, C (PhD): Oh . Sure .
Turn 33, E (Professor): So . So , uh .
Turn 34, G (Grad): You wanna just go around ?
Turn 35, E (Professor): Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .
Turn 36, B (Postdoc): OK . Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ? OK .
Turn 37, E (Professor): Yeah , just explain what it was .
Turn 38, B (Postdoc): Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know , " John had washed the floor " or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? " And {disfmarker} and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now {pause} we really don't need to " . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret " ahead of the game " ? You know . So it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {pause} i What you {disfmarker} what you int what you draw {disfmarker} you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,
Turn 39, G (Grad): Hmm , metaphorically .
Turn 40, B (Postdoc): that um , i that {pause} i we have enough space , and he continues , like " we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling " . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , " ahead of the game " is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .
Turn 41, G (Grad): So , do you think his interest is in using this as {pause} a data source , or {pause} training material , or what ?
Turn 42, E (Professor): Well , I {disfmarker} I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours
Turn 43, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 44, E (Professor): and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're {disfmarker} already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?
Turn 45, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 46, E (Professor): Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong {pause} task for {disfmarker} for him to pursue his {disfmarker} "
Turn 47, G (Grad): Wrong , yeah .
Turn 48, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that {disfmarker} that you looked at that {disfmarker} that it 's plausible at least .
Turn 49, B (Postdoc): It 's possible . Uh , he was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically
Turn 50, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 51, B (Postdoc): and then uh meet again .
Turn 52, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 53, B (Postdoc): So it 's , you know , not a matter of a {disfmarker}
Turn 54, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 55, B (Postdoc): But , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think it was optimistic .
Turn 56, E (Professor): So anyway , that 's {disfmarker} that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might {disfmarker} might {disfmarker} might come out from some of this .
Turn 57, C (PhD): But he can use text , basically . I mean , he 's talking about just using text
Turn 58, B (Postdoc): That 's his major {disfmarker} I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours
Turn 59, C (PhD): pretty much , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 60, B (Postdoc): and {pause} that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . He 's interested in these {disfmarker} these knowledge structures ,
Turn 61, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 62, D (PhD): Yeah , interesting .
Turn 63, B (Postdoc): inferences that you draw {pause} i from {disfmarker}
Turn 64, E (Professor): I mean , he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in this stuff . So .
Turn 65, G (Grad): And I imagine that transcripts of speech {disfmarker} I mean text that is speech {disfmarker} probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .
Turn 66, E (Professor): I don't know , probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was . But .
Turn 67, B (Postdoc): Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know {disfmarker} I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious ,
Turn 68, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 69, B (Postdoc): so .
Turn 70, G (Grad): Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're {disfmarker} when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Turn 71, B (Postdoc): Oh . That aspect .
Turn 72, G (Grad): Yeah . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face . I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " {comment} in that {disfmarker} in that context ,
Turn 73, B (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 74, G (Grad): I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .
Turn 75, B (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .
Turn 76, G (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 77, B (Postdoc): This {disfmarker} this one really does um m make you leap from {disfmarker} So he said , you know , " we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling " .
Turn 78, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 79, B (Postdoc): And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be {disfmarker}
Turn 80, G (Grad): I guess it would be the same .
Turn 81, B (Postdoc): Uh - huh . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those .
Turn 82, F (PhD): Can I {disfmarker} Sorry to interrupt . Um , I f f f I 've {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} d A minute {disfmarker} uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was {disfmarker} was not listening and {disfmarker} So who is " he " in this context ?
Turn 83, C (PhD): Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun {disfmarker}
Turn 84, F (PhD): OK . So I was just realizing we 've {disfmarker} You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three {disfmarker} three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .
Turn 85, C (PhD): I believe it . Yeah . Actually to make it worse , {comment} uh , Morgan uses " you " and " you "
Turn 86, F (PhD): So this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .
Turn 87, G (Grad): It 's in my notes .
Turn 88, C (PhD): with gaze and no identification , or {disfmarker} I just wrote this down . Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you had some ideas "
Turn 89, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 90, F (PhD): You just wrote this ?
Turn 91, C (PhD): and he never said Li - He looked {disfmarker}
Turn 92, G (Grad): Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,
Turn 93, C (PhD): Right , so it 's great .
Turn 94, G (Grad): aren't you ?
Turn 95, C (PhD): So this is really great
Turn 96, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 97, C (PhD): because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,
Turn 98, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 99, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 100, C (PhD): I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics . Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .
Turn 101, E (Professor): Uh - huh . Could be .
Turn 102, B (Postdoc): Can we
Turn 103, E (Professor): Yeah . That would be tou
Turn 104, G (Grad): Oh , that would be interesting .
Turn 105, C (PhD): Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when {disfmarker}
Turn 106, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 107, C (PhD): Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .
Turn 108, G (Grad): Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell .
Turn 109, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 110, G (Grad): Uh .
Turn 111, B (Postdoc): Oh , but you 'd have the {disfmarker}
Turn 112, C (PhD): Put Morgan always like this
Turn 113, B (Postdoc): You 'd have fainter {disfmarker}
Turn 114, C (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 115, B (Postdoc): Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?
Turn 116, E (Professor): Well , these {disfmarker}
Turn 117, G (Grad): Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .
Turn 118, C (PhD): But you don't have this {disfmarker} this problem .
Turn 119, B (Postdoc): I see .
Turn 120, C (PhD): Morgan is the one who does this most .
Turn 121, G (Grad): So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .
Turn 122, E (Professor): I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about {disfmarker} and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? " and so on .
Turn 123, G (Grad): Lawyers .
Turn 124, E (Professor): And so I {disfmarker} so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh {disfmarker}
Turn 125, B (Postdoc): I am too .
Turn 126, C (PhD): Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .
Turn 127, B (Postdoc): I am too .
Turn 128, G (Grad): And we did mention who " he " was .
Turn 129, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 130, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 131, F (PhD): Right , but I missed it .
Turn 132, G (Grad): Early in the conversation .
Turn 133, F (PhD): But {disfmarker} it was uh {disfmarker}
Turn 134, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 135, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 136, G (Grad): Do {disfmarker} Sh - Can I say
Turn 137, E (Professor): Yeah . No no , there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 138, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 139, G (Grad): or {disfmarker} or is that just too sensitive ?
Turn 140, E (Professor): No no , it isn't sensitive at all .
Turn 141, B (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 142, E (Professor): I was just {disfmarker} I was just {disfmarker} I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it .
Turn 143, B (Postdoc): And in fact , it is {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} it is sensitive .
Turn 144, C (PhD): No , but that {disfmarker} it 's interesting .
Turn 145, E (Professor): It 's OK to {disfmarker}
Turn 146, B (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention . I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say {disfmarker} You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified uh , " in any publication using the data . " OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a {disfmarker} a snippet that says , " Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about {disfmarker} about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . " Now I mean , we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna be careful not to have the " wrongheaded " part in there , but {disfmarker} but you know , let 's say we say , you know , " Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . " or whatever . Then the issue of {disfmarker} of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and {disfmarker} and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .
Turn 147, E (Professor): b But I {disfmarker}
Turn 148, B (Postdoc): So I think it 's really {disfmarker} really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?
Turn 149, E (Professor): Yeah , well , there 's that . But I {disfmarker} I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's {disfmarker} If uh {disfmarker} You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's {disfmarker} there 's transcripts of radio shows {disfmarker} I mean people say people 's names all the time . So I think it {disfmarker} it can't be bad to say people 's names . It 's just that {disfmarker} i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of slandering anybody ,
Turn 150, C (PhD): But , then it won't {disfmarker} I mean , if we {disfmarker} if we {disfmarker}
Turn 151, E (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 152, G (Grad): It 's not a meeting .
Turn 153, C (PhD): Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if {disfmarker} if we weren't being recorded .
Turn 154, E (Professor): Yeah . Right , so I {disfmarker} So my behavior is probably not natural .
Turn 155, C (PhD): " If Person X {disfmarker} "
Turn 156, E (Professor): So .
Turn 157, B (Postdoc): Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , you know .
Turn 158, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 159, F (PhD): Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the {pause} people who do that to mark
Turn 160, G (Grad): Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .
Turn 161, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 162, G (Grad): If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .
Turn 163, E (Professor): Yeah , we really can't . But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push {disfmarker} finish this off .
Turn 164, B (Postdoc): I understand . No I just {disfmarker} I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially .
Turn 165, E (Professor): So it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 166, B (Postdoc): So , we need to talk about this later .
Turn 167, E (Professor): Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .
Turn 168, B (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 169, E (Professor): It was {disfmarker} it was just it was just unconscious {disfmarker} well , semi - conscious behavior . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was {disfmarker}
Turn 170, F (PhD): Well , I still don't know who " he " is .
Turn 171, E (Professor): I {disfmarker} I do I don't remember who " he " is .
Turn 172, C (PhD): No , you have to say , you still don't know who " he " is , with that prosody .
Turn 173, E (Professor): Ah . Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point {comment} and we were talking about Lokendra at another point .
Turn 174, B (Postdoc): Yeah , depends on which one you mean .
Turn 175, E (Professor): And I don't {disfmarker} I don't remember which {disfmarker} which part .
Turn 176, F (PhD): Oh .
Turn 177, C (PhD): It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .
Turn 178, E (Professor): Uh , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 179, G (Grad): Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .
Turn 180, F (PhD): But no . The inference stuff was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was Lokendra .
Turn 181, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 182, F (PhD): OK . That makes sense , yeah .
Turn 183, C (PhD): And the downsampling must have been Dan .
Turn 184, E (Professor): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 185, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 186, E (Professor): Good {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 187, C (PhD): It 's an inference .
Turn 188, E (Professor): Yeah , you could do all these inferences , yeah .
Turn 189, G (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 190, E (Professor): Yeah . Um , I {disfmarker} I would like to move it into {disfmarker} into uh what Jose uh has been doing
Turn 191, B (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 192, E (Professor): because he 's actually been doing something .
Turn 193, D (PhD): Uh - huh . OK .
Turn 194, E (Professor): So . {vocalsound} Right .
Turn 195, F (PhD): As opposed to the rest of us .
Turn 196, D (PhD): Well - {comment} {vocalsound} OK . I {disfmarker} I remind that me {disfmarker} my first objective eh , in the project is to {disfmarker} to study difference parameters to {disfmarker} to find a {disfmarker} a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , {vocalsound} tsk , {comment} {vocalsound} ehhh {comment} In that way {comment} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I begin to {disfmarker} to study and to analyze the ehn {disfmarker} the recorded speech eh the different session to {disfmarker} to find and to locate and to mark eh the {disfmarker} the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh {disfmarker} I am transcribing the {disfmarker} the first session and I {disfmarker} I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh {disfmarker} {comment} I don't know what is the different names eh you use to {disfmarker} to name the {disfmarker} the {pause} n speech
Turn 197, A (PhD): Nonspeech sounds ?
Turn 198, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 199, G (Grad): Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . So .
Turn 200, D (PhD): Yeah . Eh , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't need to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} to m to label the {disfmarker} the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to {disfmarker} to study if eh , I {disfmarker} I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to test these parameters eh with the {disfmarker} another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to eh {disfmarker} to find what is the ehm {disfmarker} the false {disfmarker} eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the {disfmarker} the ehm {disfmarker} this eh parameter {disfmarker} eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature {disfmarker}
Turn 201, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 202, A (PhD): You know {disfmarker} I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there .
Turn 203, G (Grad): So it was {disfmarker}
Turn 204, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 205, A (PhD): I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily {disfmarker} or , you know , something like that , it 'd be {disfmarker} it might be hard to know that it was two separate events .
Turn 206, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 207, G (Grad): Well {disfmarker} You weren't talking about just overlaps
Turn 208, D (PhD): Ye
Turn 209, G (Grad): were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events .
Turn 210, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,
Turn 211, G (Grad): Someone starts , someone stops {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 212, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 213, D (PhD): but eh my {disfmarker} my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone .
Turn 214, G (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 215, D (PhD): Eh ? {comment} n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .
Turn 216, E (Professor): How many overlaps were there uh in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ?
Turn 217, D (PhD): How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session
Turn 218, G (Grad): Oh , God !
Turn 219, D (PhD): in five {disfmarker} eh in forty - five minutes .
Turn 220, A (PhD): Three hundred overlapping speech {disfmarker}
Turn 221, D (PhD): Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone .
Turn 222, G (Grad): Ugh .
Turn 223, C (PhD): Overlapping speech .
Turn 224, D (PhD): With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech {disfmarker} speech what eh different duration .
Turn 225, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 226, E (Professor): Sure .
Turn 227, B (Postdoc): Does this {disfmarker} ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ?
Turn 228, D (PhD): Yeah , three people , two people . Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be
Turn 229, E (Professor): No no , but I think what she 's asking is {pause} if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ?
Turn 230, D (PhD): Oh . Oh . Yeah . I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . This {disfmarker} th I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh {disfmarker} are talking together .
Turn 231, G (Grad): Well {disfmarker} So let 's {disfmarker}
Turn 232, B (Postdoc): For
Turn 233, G (Grad): So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . How many events would that be ?
Turn 234, D (PhD): So - I don't understand .
Turn 235, G (Grad): So , two people are talking , {comment} and then a third person starts talking .
Turn 236, D (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 237, G (Grad): Is there an event right here ?
Turn 238, D (PhD): Eh no . No no . For me is the overlapping zone , because {disfmarker} because you {disfmarker} you have s you have more one {disfmarker} eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a moment .
Turn 239, E (Professor): I see .
Turn 240, G (Grad): So i if two or more people are talking .
Turn 241, E (Professor): OK . Yeah . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .
Turn 242, D (PhD): Yeah . If
Turn 243, E (Professor): So then , in the region between {disfmarker} since there {disfmarker} there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .
Turn 244, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 245, E (Professor): And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .
Turn 246, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 247, E (Professor): Is it {disfmarker} Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,
Turn 248, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 249, E (Professor): or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?
Turn 250, D (PhD): I consider the {disfmarker} the , nnn {disfmarker} the nnn , nnn {disfmarker} eh , the entirety eh , eh , all {disfmarker} all the time there were {disfmarker} the voice has overlapped .
Turn 251, E (Professor): OK .
Turn 252, D (PhD): This is the idea . But eh I {disfmarker} I don't distinguish between the {disfmarker} the numbers of eh speaker . Uh , I 'm not considering {vocalsound} eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} ehm {vocalsound} eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to {disfmarker} to that . For me , it 's eh {disfmarker} it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but {disfmarker} uh , without any mark between the zone {disfmarker} of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers .
Turn 253, B (Postdoc): That would j just be one .
Turn 254, D (PhD): It {disfmarker} One . One .
Turn 255, B (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 256, D (PhD): Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . Because eh {vocalsound} for me , is the {disfmarker} is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .
Turn 257, E (Professor): Got it .
Turn 258, D (PhD): I don't mind {disfmarker} By the moment , by the moment .
Turn 259, G (Grad): Well , but {disfmarker} But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .
Turn 260, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} Yeah , but eh {disfmarker} but eh I have to study . {comment} What will happen in a general way ,
Turn 261, E (Professor): Could .
Turn 262, G (Grad): So . You had to start somewhere .
Turn 263, E (Professor): Yeah . We just w
Turn 264, C (PhD): So there 's a lot of overlap .
Turn 265, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know what eh will {disfmarker} will happen with the {disfmarker}
Turn 266, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 267, C (PhD): So .
Turn 268, G (Grad): That 's a lot of overlap ,
Turn 269, D (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 270, E (Professor): So again , that 's {disfmarker} that 's three {disfmarker} three hundred in forty - five minutes that are {disfmarker} that are speakers , just speakers .
Turn 271, G (Grad): yeah , for forty - five minutes .
Turn 272, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 273, E (Professor): Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .
Turn 274, B (Postdoc): But a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a th
Turn 275, E (Professor): So that 's about eight per minute .
Turn 276, B (Postdoc): But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 277, D (PhD): Yeah , {pause} but {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 278, C (PhD): But that can include taps .
Turn 279, D (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 280, E (Professor): Uh . Yeah .
Turn 281, B (Postdoc): Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot .
Turn 282, D (PhD): General .
Turn 283, C (PhD): Actually {disfmarker}
Turn 284, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too .
Turn 285, B (Postdoc): Silent .
Turn 286, G (Grad): Silence starting or silence ending {disfmarker}
Turn 287, D (PhD): Yeah , silent , ground to {disfmarker} bec to detect {disfmarker} eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .
Turn 288, C (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 289, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 290, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 291, D (PhD): In ge in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a general point of view .
Turn 292, C (PhD): Oh .
Turn 293, E (Professor): OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?
Turn 294, C (PhD): Alright .
Turn 295, D (PhD): in the per
Turn 296, F (PhD): Not speech {disfmarker} not speech or too much speech .
Turn 297, D (PhD): Too much speech .
Turn 298, E (Professor): Right . So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ?
Turn 299, D (PhD): Yeah . Uh silent , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't the {disfmarker} eh I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to do a stylistic study
Turn 300, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 301, D (PhD): and give you eh with the report eh from eh the {disfmarker} the study from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the session {disfmarker} one session .
Turn 302, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 303, D (PhD): And I {disfmarker} I found that eh another thing . When eh {vocalsound} eh I w I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm {disfmarker} the mixed file , to {disfmarker} to transcribe , the {disfmarker} the events and the words , I {disfmarker} I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike {disfmarker} eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh {disfmarker} collected by headphone .
Turn 304, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 305, D (PhD): And {disfmarker} It 's right .
Turn 306, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 307, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 308, D (PhD): But the problem is {vocalsound} the following . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the {disfmarker} the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by {disfmarker} by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . And so if {disfmarker} when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn {disfmarker} the mixed file , it 's possible {disfmarker} eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh {disfmarker} in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh {disfmarker} to nnn {disfmarker} to do the experiments {pause} with the {disfmarker} the system ,
Turn 309, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 310, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 311, D (PhD): its possible to evaluate eh , eh {disfmarker} or to consider eh acoustic events that {disfmarker} which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the {disfmarker} by the mike .
Turn 312, G (Grad): Right . The {disfmarker} the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .
Turn 313, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . It 's a good idea I think .
Turn 314, G (Grad): So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here {disfmarker}
Turn 315, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 316, G (Grad): I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .
Turn 317, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh {disfmarker} to eh {disfmarker} to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .
Turn 318, G (Grad): So .
Turn 319, D (PhD): I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the signal collected by the {disfmarker} eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to {disfmarker} to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech
Turn 320, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field , yeah .
Turn 321, D (PhD): you have to {disfmarker} to analyze {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker} to process . Because I {disfmarker} I found a difference .
Turn 322, E (Professor): Yeah , well , just {disfmarker} I mean , just in that {disfmarker} that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and {disfmarker} and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study {disfmarker} if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .
Turn 323, F (PhD): That 's good .
Turn 324, E (Professor): On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,
Turn 325, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 326, C (PhD): But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?
Turn 327, E (Professor): so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 328, G (Grad): If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in {disfmarker}
Turn 329, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,
Turn 330, E (Professor): Some {comment} of it 's masking {disfmarker} masked .
Turn 331, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 332, A (PhD): Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?
Turn 333, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 334, C (PhD): right ?
Turn 335, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 336, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 337, G (Grad): Although the other issue is that the {pause} mixed close - talking mikes {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .
Turn 338, C (PhD): But it 's known .
Turn 339, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 340, C (PhD): I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation
Turn 341, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 342, C (PhD): isn't it , over the whole meeting .
Turn 343, G (Grad): Right . Yep .
Turn 344, C (PhD): So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .
Turn 345, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh I saw the nnn {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} eh but eh I eh {disfmarker} I have eh any results . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I saw the {disfmarker} the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh {disfmarker} to noise eh relation is eh low . It 's low .
Turn 346, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 347, D (PhD): It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone .
Turn 348, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 349, D (PhD): And I {disfmarker} I found that nnn {disfmarker} that eh , {vocalsound} ehm , pr probably ,
Turn 350, G (Grad): Did {disfmarker} Did you
Turn 351, D (PhD): I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , {vocalsound} eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in several eh parts of the files where you {disfmarker} you can find eh , eh {vocalsound} eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the {disfmarker} in the meeting ,
Turn 352, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 353, D (PhD): it 's probably in {disfmarker} in that eh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in those files you {disfmarker} you can not find {disfmarker} you can not process because eh it 's confused with {disfmarker} with noise .
Turn 354, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 355, D (PhD): And there are {vocalsound} a lot of I think . But I have to study with more detail . But eh my idea is to {disfmarker} to process only {pause} nnn , this eh {disfmarker} nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . Because I think it 's more realistic . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh {disfmarker}
Turn 356, E (Professor): No {disfmarker} i
Turn 357, G (Grad): Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll be a lot harder .
Turn 358, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 359, E (Professor): Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your {disfmarker} if i if {disfmarker} if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people {disfmarker} people 's speech , you will {disfmarker} you will get that somewhat better .
Turn 360, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 361, E (Professor): Um , Are you making any use {disfmarker} uh you were {disfmarker} you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed .
Turn 362, D (PhD): With {disfmarker} By Jane .
Turn 363, E (Professor): Does it uh {disfmarker} Yes .
Turn 364, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 365, E (Professor): Now um did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .
Turn 366, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 367, E (Professor): Do you {disfmarker}
Turn 368, D (PhD): The {disfmarker} the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use to {disfmarker} to nnn , {vocalsound} eh to put {disfmarker} i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription {disfmarker} eh for example , I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not interested in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in {disfmarker} eh follow in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the {disfmarker} in the meeting , um eh she {disfmarker} she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh {disfmarker} there is an overlapping zone . But eh there isn't any {disfmarker} any mark , time {disfmarker} temporal mark , to {disfmarker} to c eh {disfmarker} to mmm {vocalsound} {disfmarker} e - heh , to label {comment} the beginning and the end of the {disfmarker} of the
Turn 369, E (Professor): Mm - hmm . OK . Right , so she is {disfmarker}
Turn 370, D (PhD): ta I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think eh we need this information to
Turn 371, E (Professor): Right . So the twelve {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} it took you twelve hours {disfmarker} of course this included maybe some {disfmarker} some time where you were learning about what {disfmarker} what you wanted to do , but {disfmarker} but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your
Turn 372, G (Grad): Twelve minutes .
Turn 373, D (PhD): Twelve minutes .
Turn 374, E (Professor): s Twelve minutes !
Turn 375, D (PhD): Twelve minutes . Twelve .
Turn 376, E (Professor): I thought you did forty - five minutes of {disfmarker}
Turn 377, D (PhD): No , forty - five minutes is the {disfmarker} is the session , all the session .
Turn 378, B (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 379, E (Professor): Oh , you haven't done the whole session .
Turn 380, D (PhD): Yeah , all is the {vocalsound} the session .
Turn 381, E (Professor): This is just twelve minutes .
Turn 382, D (PhD): Tw - twelve hours of work to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part {disfmarker} of f
Turn 383, E (Professor): Oh . So {comment} let me back up again . So the {disfmarker} when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,
Turn 384, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 385, E (Professor): that 's in twelve minutes ?
Turn 386, D (PhD): No no no . I {disfmarker} I consider all the {disfmarker} all the session because eh I {disfmarker} I count the nnn {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} the overlappings marked by {disfmarker} by Jane ,
Turn 387, E (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 388, B (Postdoc): Oh , I see .
Turn 389, D (PhD): in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the {pause} fin in {disfmarker} in the {pause} forty - five minutes .
Turn 390, E (Professor): OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have {disfmarker} you have time uh , uh marked {disfmarker} twelve minute {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .
Turn 391, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 392, E (Professor): Got it .
Turn 393, F (PhD): So , can I ask {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can I ask whether you found {disfmarker} uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as {disfmarker}
Turn 394, G (Grad): Well , not just the overlaps , everything .
Turn 395, F (PhD): you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ?
Turn 396, D (PhD): But , by {disfmarker} by the moment , I {disfmarker} I don't compare , my {disfmarker} my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I {disfmarker} I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the {disfmarker} in the marks , I {disfmarker} and if I {disfmarker} I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can correct and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .
Turn 397, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 398, G (Grad): Well , also Jane {disfmarker} Jane was doing word level .
Turn 399, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 400, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 401, G (Grad): So we weren't concerned with {comment} exactly when an overlap started and stopped .
Turn 402, F (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 403, C (PhD): Well , not only a word level , but actually
Turn 404, D (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 405, F (PhD): I 'm expect I 'm not expecting {disfmarker}
Turn 406, D (PhD): No , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 407, C (PhD): I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or {disfmarker}
Turn 408, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 409, E (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 410, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 411, B (Postdoc): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 412, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 413, B (Postdoc): Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . So my {disfmarker} my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , {pause} beginning and end point .
Turn 414, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 415, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 416, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 417, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 418, B (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,
Turn 419, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 420, B (Postdoc): but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that {disfmarker} i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have {disfmarker} it would have been hard with the interface that we have .
Turn 421, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 422, B (Postdoc): Now , my {disfmarker} a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface ,
Turn 423, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 424, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 425, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's a good eh work ,
Turn 426, B (Postdoc): but {disfmarker}
Turn 427, D (PhD): but eh I think we need eh eh more information .
Turn 428, F (PhD): No , of course .
Turn 429, B (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 430, F (PhD): I expect you to find more overlaps than {disfmarker} than Jane
Turn 431, G (Grad): Always need more for {disfmarker}
Turn 432, B (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 433, D (PhD): No , no . I {disfmarker} I have to go to {disfmarker}
Turn 434, F (PhD): because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level .
Turn 435, D (PhD): I want eh {disfmarker} I wanted to eh compare the {disfmarker} the transcription .
Turn 436, E (Professor): I have {disfmarker}
Turn 437, G (Grad): But if it takes sixty to one {disfmarker}
Turn 438, E (Professor): Well , I but I have a suggestion about that . Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s how {disfmarker} how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?
Turn 439, D (PhD): Only .
Turn 440, E (Professor): Yes .
Turn 441, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 442, E (Professor): Do not mark any other events ,
Turn 443, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 444, E (Professor): but only mark speaker {disfmarker} Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?
Turn 445, D (PhD): OK . OK . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker}
Turn 446, E (Professor): Do y do you think that would speed it up ? Uh , speed up your {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} your marking ?
Turn 447, D (PhD): nnn , I don't understand very .
Turn 448, E (Professor): It took you a long time {pause} to mark twelve minutes .
Turn 449, D (PhD): Yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah .
Turn 450, E (Professor): Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three {disfmarker}
Turn 451, D (PhD): On - only to mark {disfmarker} only to mark overlapping zone , but {disfmarker}
Turn 452, E (Professor): Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?
Turn 453, D (PhD): Oh , yeah . Sure .
Turn 454, E (Professor): Yeah OK .
Turn 455, D (PhD): Yeah sure .
Turn 456, E (Professor): Then I think it 's a good idea .
Turn 457, D (PhD): Sure sure .
Turn 458, E (Professor): Then I think it 's a good idea , because it
Turn 459, D (PhD): Sure , because I {disfmarker} I need a lot of time to {disfmarker} to put the label or to do that . Yeah .
Turn 460, E (Professor): Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .
Turn 461, G (Grad): And
Turn 462, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 463, E (Professor): There 's {disfmarker} there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth
Turn 464, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 465, E (Professor): and {disfmarker} and something in between with paper rustling . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .
Turn 466, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 467, E (Professor): Whereas th i I would think that uh you {disfmarker} we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .
Turn 468, D (PhD): Uh - huh . OK . OK .
Turn 469, E (Professor): So . Then you can get the {disfmarker} Cuz you need {disfmarker} If it 's three hundred uh {disfmarker} i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really {disfmarker}
Turn 470, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 471, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of {disfmarker} of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .
Turn 472, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 473, C (PhD): Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the {disfmarker}
Turn 474, G (Grad): Well , that 's {disfmarker} That 's what I was gonna bring up .
Turn 475, C (PhD): I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,
Turn 476, E (Professor): Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .
Turn 477, C (PhD): right ? I 'm sorry .
Turn 478, E (Professor): So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as {disfmarker} I mean there 's a bunch of things {disfmarker} I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .
Turn 479, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . In the far - field mike .
Turn 480, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 481, C (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 482, E (Professor): Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could {disfmarker} you could do the dumbest thing and get {disfmarker} get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the {disfmarker} you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say " OK this , i you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really here " .
Turn 483, A (PhD): But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?
Turn 484, C (PhD): What I mean is {pause} get it from the close - talking mikes .
Turn 485, E (Professor): Uh , yeah .
Turn 486, C (PhD): A or ge get a first pass from those ,
Turn 487, E (Professor): We t we t w we t we talked about that .
Turn 488, C (PhD): and then go through sort of {disfmarker} It 'd be a lot faster probably to {disfmarker}
Turn 489, F (PhD): And you can {disfmarker}
Turn 490, G (Grad): Yeah , that 's his , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 491, E (Professor): We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,
Turn 492, C (PhD): Yeah , I just {disfmarker}
Turn 493, E (Professor): the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and {disfmarker} and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,
Turn 494, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 495, E (Professor): and we could {disfmarker} Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then {disfmarker} then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .
Turn 496, C (PhD): Well , that 's what I wonder , because um {disfmarker} or how bad it is ,
Turn 497, E (Professor): Well
Turn 498, C (PhD): be um , because that would be interesting
Turn 499, G (Grad): I 'm working on a program to do that , and {disfmarker}
Turn 500, C (PhD): especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ? I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . We have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike ,
Turn 501, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 502, C (PhD): so I mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but {disfmarker} um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,
Turn 503, E (Professor): Right , we discussed that .
Turn 504, C (PhD): you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?
Turn 505, G (Grad): And {disfmarker}
Turn 506, B (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 507, G (Grad): I 've {disfmarker} I 've written a program to do that ,
Turn 508, C (PhD): OK , I 'm sorry I missed the {disfmarker}
Turn 509, G (Grad): and it , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 510, E (Professor): It 's OK .
Turn 511, G (Grad): and {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on {disfmarker} on the volume ,
Turn 512, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 513, F (PhD): Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .
Turn 514, C (PhD): Right , by hand . Yeah .
Turn 515, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 516, G (Grad): um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . And , it seems to work , I 've {disfmarker} I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I haven't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} what I 'm working on {disfmarker} was working on {disfmarker} was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , {pause} into Transcriber . And so {disfmarker} I told {disfmarker} I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day ,
Turn 517, H (Grad): I have to go .
Turn 518, G (Grad): so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .
Turn 519, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 520, E (Professor): See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,
Turn 521, C (PhD): Right . I 'm sorry . I just {disfmarker}
Turn 522, E (Professor): but I couldn't remember all of it .
Turn 523, C (PhD): It
Turn 524, E (Professor): So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when {disfmarker} when he {disfmarker} he gets his thing going ,
Turn 525, G (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 526, E (Professor): uh , and {disfmarker}
Turn 527, C (PhD): Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of {disfmarker}
Turn 528, B (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 529, E (Professor): That was {disfmarker} that was exactly the notion that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we discussed .
Turn 530, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 531, G (Grad): Thanks .
Turn 532, B (Postdoc): Another thing we discussed was um that {disfmarker}
Turn 533, C (PhD): It looks good .
Turn 534, E (Professor): So .
Turn 535, C (PhD): I 'll be in touch . Thanks .
Turn 536, E (Professor): S See ya . Yeah .
Turn 537, B (Postdoc): Was that um there m {pause} there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , {comment} that uh handle bleedthrough , I mean cuz you have this {disfmarker} this close {disfmarker} you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .
Turn 538, G (Grad): Yeah , and I haven't tried using that . It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that . It 's a cross - correlation filter . So I {disfmarker} I haven't tried that , but that {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it might be something {disfmarker} it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .
Turn 539, B (Postdoc): So , some thought of maybe having {disfmarker} Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .
Turn 540, G (Grad): Exactly . Yep .
Turn 541, E (Professor): But {disfmarker} but that 's a refinement
Turn 542, B (Postdoc): That 's what we were discussing .
Turn 543, E (Professor): and I think we wanna see {disfmarker} try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .
Turn 544, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 545, E (Professor): But uh , having {disfmarker} having somebody have some experience , again , with {disfmarker} with uh {disfmarker} with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're {disfmarker} I mean , I don't expect Jose to {disfmarker} to do it for uh f fifty hours of {disfmarker} {comment} of speech , but I mean we {disfmarker} {comment} if uh {disfmarker} if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .
Turn 546, D (PhD): Yeah . Sure . Sure .
Turn 547, E (Professor): And when {disfmarker} when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .
Turn 548, C (PhD): Oh yeah , definitely .
Turn 549, A (PhD): You know , I did {disfmarker} I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well . I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . And uh , you know , you can {disfmarker}
Turn 550, G (Grad): It seemed like the right thing to do .
Turn 551, A (PhD): Yeah . I mean , you {disfmarker} you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close .
Turn 552, G (Grad): That was with zero literature search .
Turn 553, A (PhD): And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to {disfmarker} to do it .
Turn 554, G (Grad): That 's good validation .
Turn 555, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 556, B (Postdoc): Is this proprietary ?
Turn 557, A (PhD): Uh . {comment} No . No .
Turn 558, G (Grad): Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?
Turn 559, A (PhD): It was when I was working for the government .
Turn 560, E (Professor): Oh , then everybody owns it . It 's the people .
Turn 561, B (Postdoc): Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it {disfmarker} ?
Turn 562, A (PhD): Nah .
Turn 563, B (Postdoc): No . OK .
Turn 564, E (Professor): Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 565, A (PhD): Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't take a long time .
Turn 566, B (Postdoc): Right . I just thought if it was tried and true , then {disfmarker} {comment} and he 's gone through additional levels of {disfmarker} of development .
Turn 567, G (Grad): Just output . Although if you {disfmarker} if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter {disfmarker}
Turn 568, A (PhD): Oh ! {comment} I have to remember . I 'll think about it , and try to remember .
Turn 569, F (PhD): And it might be different for government people .
Turn 570, G (Grad): That 's alright .
Turn 571, E (Professor): Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say .
Turn 572, C (PhD): They {disfmarker} they {disfmarker}
Turn 573, A (PhD): Di - dif different {disfmarker} different bandwidth .
Turn 574, F (PhD): They
Turn 575, G (Grad): I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , {comment} sorts of numbers .
Turn 576, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 577, E (Professor): Uh , I don't know , it {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we want to uh {disfmarker} So , uh , maybe we should move on to other {disfmarker} other things in limited time .
Turn 578, B (Postdoc): Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So {disfmarker} so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .
Turn 579, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 580, B (Postdoc): Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 581, D (PhD): More than ?
Turn 582, B (Postdoc): More than {disfmarker} How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?
Turn 583, D (PhD): How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I {disfmarker} I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the
Turn 584, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 585, D (PhD): but eh I {disfmarker} I don't co eh {disfmarker} I don't count eh the {disfmarker} the overlap .
Turn 586, B (Postdoc): The overlaps . OK .
Turn 587, D (PhD): I consider I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the three hundred is eh considered only you {disfmarker} your transcription . I have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to finish transcribing . So .
Turn 588, G (Grad): I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than {disfmarker} than sort of the middle .
Turn 589, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 590, G (Grad): Middle or end .
Turn 591, B (Postdoc): I 'm not sure .
Turn 592, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 593, G (Grad): Because i we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with the {disfmarker} Uh , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , {comment} and things like that ,
Turn 594, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 595, G (Grad): and that seems to be a lot of overlap .
Turn 596, B (Postdoc): I think it 's an empirical question .
Turn 597, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 598, B (Postdoc): I think we could find that out .
Turn 599, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 600, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 601, B (Postdoc): I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .
Turn 602, E (Professor): So {disfmarker} so I was gonna ask , I guess about any {disfmarker} any other things that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that {disfmarker} that you wanna go with .
Turn 603, C (PhD): Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm {disfmarker} I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what {disfmarker} what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording
Turn 604, E (Professor): Right so there 's this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .
Turn 605, C (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 606, E (Professor): That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM . Right ? And then we don't know .
Turn 607, C (PhD): How many meetings is that ? Like {disfmarker} how many {disfmarker}
Turn 608, G (Grad): What 's that ?
Turn 609, E (Professor): That was about ten hours , and there was about {disfmarker}
Turn 610, C (PhD): t ten {disfmarker} It 's like ten meetings or something ? Uh - huh .
Turn 611, G (Grad): Yeah , something like that . And then {disfmarker} then we
Turn 612, A (PhD): Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ?
Turn 613, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 614, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 615, G (Grad): Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the {pause} missing files .
Turn 616, E (Professor): Oh . Oh , that 's right , that had {disfmarker} those have not been sent .
Turn 617, A (PhD): H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?
Turn 618, E (Professor): We 're saying about {pause} twelve hours .
Turn 619, G (Grad): About twelve {pause} by now . Twelve or thirteen .
Turn 620, C (PhD): Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 621, E (Professor): No . No , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the biggest one {disfmarker} uh , chunk so far ,
Turn 622, G (Grad): Nope .
Turn 623, A (PhD): It was the morning one .
Turn 624, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 625, E (Professor): but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .
Turn 626, G (Grad): Jerry .
Turn 627, C (PhD): Do they meet every week ,
Turn 628, E (Professor): And then there {disfmarker}
Turn 629, C (PhD): or every {disfmarker}
Turn 630, E (Professor): Uh , they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , and we 're recording those , uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,
Turn 631, C (PhD): Great .
Turn 632, E (Professor): and we 're gonna start recording them . They 're {disfmarker} They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week . So actually , we 're gonna h start having a {disfmarker} a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , {vocalsound} Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff {disfmarker} things like that , now that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that {disfmarker} that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately {disfmarker} i if we 're {disfmarker} if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not eighty or ninety . But .
Turn 633, C (PhD): So there 's probably {disfmarker} there 's three to four a week ,
Turn 634, G (Grad): That 's what we 're aiming for .
Turn 635, C (PhD): that we 're aiming for .
Turn 636, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 637, C (PhD): And they 're each about an hour or something .
Turn 638, E (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 639, G (Grad): Although {disfmarker} Yeah . We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .
Turn 640, C (PhD): So {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 641, E (Professor): Yeah and th the {disfmarker} the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know {disfmarker} maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .
Turn 642, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 643, E (Professor): Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .
Turn 644, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 645, E (Professor): And , you know , we {disfmarker} we h we 're highly motivated . Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 646, G (Grad): Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .
Turn 647, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 648, G (Grad): We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .
Turn 649, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 650, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 651, G (Grad): And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance . But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that . Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?
Turn 652, E (Professor): Uh , yeah , I {disfmarker} I think definitely s so Absolutely .
Turn 653, G (Grad): I mean , is it something of interest ?
Turn 654, E (Professor): Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .
Turn 655, G (Grad): OK . I mean , I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in it , I just don't have time to do it now .
Turn 656, F (PhD): I was {disfmarker} these meetings {disfmarker} I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these {disfmarker} this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation .
Turn 657, G (Grad): So
Turn 658, F (PhD): Um .
Turn 659, G (Grad): Yep . Yep .
Turn 660, C (PhD): Actually I have o
Turn 661, G (Grad): I {disfmarker} I would really like someone to do adaptation .
Turn 662, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 663, G (Grad): So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .
Turn 664, E (Professor): Well {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to {disfmarker} to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,
Turn 665, G (Grad): Since it 's the same people over and over .
Turn 666, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 667, E (Professor): to try to get rid of some of the effects of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field effects . Um , I mean we have {disfmarker} the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation
Turn 668, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 669, E (Professor): because people move around , and uh , if {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} you can't really do inversion ,
Turn 670, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 671, E (Professor): and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something {disfmarker} It may {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " .
Turn 672, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 673, E (Professor): Uh , that 's the party line . But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . It 's good {disfmarker} {vocalsound} good to sort of test them , actually . And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a {disfmarker} have been some nice talks recently by {disfmarker} by Lucent on {disfmarker} on their b
Turn 674, F (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 675, E (Professor): the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . {comment} And um , you know , th
Turn 676, A (PhD): W what is the um {disfmarker} the artifact you try to {disfmarker} you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?
Turn 677, F (PhD): Ciao .
Turn 678, E (Professor): Uh so it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} you have a {disfmarker} a direct uh {disfmarker} Uh , what 's the difference in {disfmarker} If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um {disfmarker}
Turn 679, F (PhD): I 'm signing off .
Turn 680, E (Professor): Yeah . that would subtract off {comment} the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so {disfmarker} so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation {disfmarker} Yeah , so you {disfmarker} Given that um {disfmarker} Yeah , so you 're trying to {disfmarker} So you 'd {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself {disfmarker} adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract {disfmarker} essentially to subtract off uh different uh {disfmarker} different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had {disfmarker} you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a {disfmarker} there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .
Turn 681, A (PhD): So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would {disfmarker} you might hear kind of an echo ? And {disfmarker} and then this {disfmarker} noise cancellation would get
Turn 682, E (Professor): Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm saying {disfmarker} That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . {comment} What 's really happening is {disfmarker} Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you {disfmarker} To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the {disfmarker} the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the {disfmarker} the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use this uh {disfmarker} this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this {disfmarker} this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh {disfmarker} gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to {disfmarker} you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um {disfmarker} uh with some constraints .
Turn 683, A (PhD): Kind of a clean up thing , that {disfmarker}
Turn 684, E (Professor): It 's a clean up thing . Right .
Turn 685, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 686, E (Professor): So , echo cancelling is {disfmarker} is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you {disfmarker} if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .
Turn 687, A (PhD): When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um {disfmarker} some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh {disfmarker} And then it would come on and it was very clear ,
Turn 688, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 689, A (PhD): you know .
Turn 690, E (Professor): Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try {disfmarker} somebody look {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data {disfmarker} plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh . {vocalsound} Um
Turn 691, B (Postdoc): Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?
Turn 692, E (Professor): Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know {disfmarker} There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right {disfmarker} the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those {disfmarker} those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right {disfmarker} you know , right {disfmarker} right uh {disfmarker} delays are {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} right delayed signal is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a {disfmarker} in a situation that 's very reverberant {disfmarker} {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a {disfmarker} a c a complete inversion , if you actually {disfmarker} I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the {disfmarker} the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you {disfmarker} you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and {disfmarker} and uh goes to infinity . So it 's {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents {disfmarker} I mean there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking {disfmarker} uh , just picking uh features , which were {disfmarker} uh will give you more {disfmarker} something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was {disfmarker} I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you {disfmarker} you actually already said this thing about the uh {disfmarker} about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to {disfmarker} So this was the human subjects folks who said this , {comment} or that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} ?
Turn 693, B (Postdoc): The a apparently {disfmarker} I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it {pause} that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .
Turn 694, E (Professor): OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that {disfmarker} that we have . We have {disfmarker} we have an hour uh that {disfmarker} that is transcribed , we have {disfmarker} we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we {disfmarker} if this really uh {disfmarker} Well , do we have that much ?
Turn 695, C (PhD): Not really . It 's three to four per week .
Turn 696, E (Professor): Let 's see , we have {disfmarker}
Turn 697, C (PhD): So that 's what {disfmarker} You know , that {disfmarker}
Turn 698, E (Professor): uh eight weeks , uh is {disfmarker}
Turn 699, C (PhD): So that 's not a lot of hours .
Turn 700, E (Professor): Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , so like thirty {disfmarker} thirty hours ?
Turn 701, A (PhD): Three {disfmarker} Three hours .
Turn 702, C (PhD): Yeah . I mean , is there {disfmarker} I know this sounds {pause} tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this {vocalsound} but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,
Turn 703, E (Professor): But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .
Turn 704, C (PhD): so {disfmarker}
Turn 705, E (Professor): Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .
Turn 706, C (PhD): I mean , is there {disfmarker} Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them {comment} or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong {disfmarker}
Turn 707, G (Grad): We had some good ones earlier .
Turn 708, C (PhD): There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or {disfmarker}
Turn 709, G (Grad): I think it 's hard to record those .
Turn 710, C (PhD): To be allowed to record them ?
Turn 711, B (Postdoc): It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .
Turn 712, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 713, E (Professor): Yeah , people will get {disfmarker}
Turn 714, B (Postdoc): But I {disfmarker} but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .
Turn 715, C (PhD): OK . Well , if there is , anyway .
Turn 716, E (Professor): Yeah , I was gonna mention that .
Turn 717, G (Grad): Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's {disfmarker} That would be a good match .
Turn 718, E (Professor): Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I 'd mentioned to Adam , and {disfmarker} that was another thing I was gonna talk {disfmarker} uh , mention to them before {disfmarker} {comment} that uh there 's uh {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , {comment} that {disfmarker} that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so it doesn't really give us the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say " hey you have this panel show , {pause} or this {disfmarker} you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? " And uh they may be willing to record it uh with {disfmarker}
Turn 719, C (PhD): With lapel mikes or something ?
Turn 720, E (Professor): Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it {disfmarker} it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .
Turn 721, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 722, E (Professor): It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they start recording , isn't {disfmarker} als also is not going to be this exact setup .
Turn 723, C (PhD): Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .
Turn 724, E (Professor): So , {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , {comment} uh that we could invite them to have like some of their {disfmarker} {comment} record some of their shows here .
Turn 725, B (Postdoc): Wow !
Turn 726, C (PhD): Well {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,
Turn 727, G (Grad): Right , as we are .
Turn 728, C (PhD): right ? So . {comment} Um , I think that 'd be fantastic
Turn 729, E (Professor): Right .
Turn 730, C (PhD): cuz those kinds of panels and {disfmarker} Those have interesting
Turn 731, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 732, C (PhD): Th - that 's an {disfmarker} a side of style {disfmarker} a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .
Turn 733, E (Professor): And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean , the other side to it was the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} which is where we were coming from {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you more about it later {comment} is that {disfmarker} is that there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and {disfmarker} and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do {disfmarker} do whatever they do . So it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um {disfmarker} and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could {disfmarker} @ @ in the {disfmarker} under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 734, C (PhD): Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you {disfmarker} you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your {disfmarker} your data for awhile so um right now {disfmarker} and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do {disfmarker} Oh , do we now ?
Turn 735, E (Professor): Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was {disfmarker}
Turn 736, C (PhD): So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now
Turn 737, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 738, C (PhD): and they 're pretty different , because
Turn 739, E (Professor): Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you {disfmarker} you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,
Turn 740, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 741, C (PhD): um {disfmarker} Right . Right , right .
Turn 742, E (Professor): and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can {disfmarker} you can do a lot of other things .
Turn 743, C (PhD): Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend {disfmarker} you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . And that 's {disfmarker} and especially with the student
Turn 744, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 745, C (PhD): uh for instance this guy who seems {disfmarker}
Turn 746, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 747, C (PhD): Uh anyway , I shouldn't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 748, E (Professor): i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now {disfmarker} Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh {disfmarker} which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .
Turn 749, C (PhD): And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,
Turn 750, E (Professor): So that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 751, B (Postdoc): Yeah , we need to {disfmarker} I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,
Turn 752, C (PhD): so . I mean , it {disfmarker}
Turn 753, B (Postdoc): and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .
Turn 754, C (PhD): Right .
Turn 755, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 756, B (Postdoc): So I think that we 'll need to adjust some {disfmarker} And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection . There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ?
Turn 757, E (Professor): If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ {disfmarker} I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real {disfmarker} Why not ? Yeah .
Turn 758, C (PhD): I mean , I 'm thinking , politically {disfmarker}
Turn 759, G (Grad): Stage some political debates .
Turn 760, B (Postdoc): You could do this ,
Turn 761, C (PhD): Well yeah ,
Turn 762, B (Postdoc): you know . You could .
Turn 763, C (PhD): or just if you 're {disfmarker} if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't {pause} um have them do the digits , {comment} or maybe have them do a shorter {pause} digit thing {comment} like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .
Turn 764, G (Grad): We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .
Turn 765, C (PhD): Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it . It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data . Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue , but there 's {disfmarker} there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .
Turn 766, B (Postdoc): It seems like you could hold some meetings .
Turn 767, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 768, B (Postdoc): You know , you and maybe Adam ?
Turn 769, C (PhD): So .
Turn 770, B (Postdoc): You {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .
Turn 771, A (PhD): Would it help at all {disfmarker} I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is uh um without doing the digits {disfmarker} Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .
Turn 772, C (PhD): Need the close - talking mikes .
Turn 773, A (PhD): You do , OK .
Turn 774, C (PhD): I mean , absolutely ,
Turn 775, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 776, C (PhD): yeah . I 'm really scared {disfmarker}
Turn 777, G (Grad): It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .
Turn 778, A (PhD): I see , OK .
Turn 779, C (PhD): Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would {disfmarker} {comment} I {disfmarker} couldn't use that data .
Turn 780, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 781, B (Postdoc): I agree . And Mari also ,
Turn 782, C (PhD): Um .
Turn 783, B (Postdoc): we had {disfmarker} This came up when she she was here . That 's important .
Turn 784, C (PhD): So it 's a great idea ,
Turn 785, E (Professor): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} b By the {disfmarker} by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .
Turn 786, C (PhD): and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad {disfmarker} like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the {disfmarker} and get the setup going .
Turn 787, E (Professor): I think the issue is just that we 're {disfmarker} we 're blazing that path . Right ? And {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} d Do you have any idea when {disfmarker} when uh the {disfmarker} you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?
Turn 788, G (Grad): Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .
Turn 789, E (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 790, G (Grad): So it 'll be early next week .
Turn 791, E (Professor): Yeah , OK . So early next week we send it to them , and then {disfmarker} then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we {disfmarker} we start , you know asking about the timing for it .
Turn 792, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 793, E (Professor): So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .
Turn 794, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 795, E (Professor): Right ?
Turn 796, G (Grad): Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Turn 797, E (Professor): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 798, G (Grad): Yeah , who knows where they are .
Turn 799, A (PhD): Have they ever responded to you ?
Turn 800, G (Grad): Nope .
Turn 801, E (Professor): Yeah , but {disfmarker} You know , so they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,
Turn 802, C (PhD): What if {disfmarker}
Turn 803, G (Grad): Yeah , you {disfmarker} we can't complain .
Turn 804, E (Professor): right ? But they {disfmarker} But at any rate , they 'll {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think once they get that sorted out , they 're {disfmarker} they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they {disfmarker} who 's {disfmarker} who is doing it , and uh I think it 's not going to be {disfmarker} I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . It 's not going to be thirty
Turn 805, G (Grad): Yep . I think that 's probably true .
Turn 806, C (PhD): Really ? So it 's the amount of {disfmarker}
Turn 807, E (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} it 's just getting it going .
Turn 808, G (Grad): It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .
Turn 809, C (PhD): Right . What about these lunch meetings {disfmarker}
Turn 810, G (Grad): Once the pipeline fills .
Turn 811, C (PhD): I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , {comment} to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ?
Turn 812, E (Professor): But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and {disfmarker}
Turn 813, C (PhD): No , I meant , um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but {disfmarker}
Turn 814, G (Grad): Oh , and we 're just chatting ?
Turn 815, C (PhD): Just the ch the chatting .
Turn 816, G (Grad): Yeah , we have a lot of those .
Turn 817, C (PhD): I actually {disfmarker} I actually think that 's {pause} useful {pause} data , um {pause} the chatting ,
Turn 818, G (Grad): Yeah , the problem with that is I would {disfmarker} I think I would feel a little constrained to {disfmarker} You know ? Uh , some of the meetings {disfmarker}
Turn 819, C (PhD): but {disfmarker} OK . You don't wanna do it , cuz {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 820, G (Grad): You know , our " soccer ball " meeting ?
Turn 821, C (PhD): Alright .
Turn 822, G (Grad): I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .
Turn 823, C (PhD): Alright , {comment} so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it .
Turn 824, G (Grad): That was hilarious .
Turn 825, E (Professor): Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they {disfmarker} because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . So then that would double {pause} what we had . Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW uh {disfmarker} I mean really m a lot more {comment} than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,
Turn 826, G (Grad): Right .
Turn 827, E (Professor): so .
Turn 828, A (PhD): Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ?
Turn 829, E (Professor): Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker} So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}
Turn 830, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 831, C (PhD): What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?
Turn 832, B (Postdoc): Well , you know , I {disfmarker} I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .
Turn 833, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 834, B (Postdoc): But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,
Turn 835, C (PhD): Alright , alright , alright .
Turn 836, B (Postdoc): but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,
Turn 837, C (PhD): No , definitely .
Turn 838, B (Postdoc): and i you know , people who are {disfmarker} Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .
Turn 839, A (PhD): Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about
Turn 840, B (Postdoc): We could pay subjects .
Turn 841, A (PhD): or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?
Turn 842, C (PhD): Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo
Turn 843, A (PhD): I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}
Turn 844, C (PhD): Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 845, G (Grad): I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .
Turn 846, B (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 847, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 848, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 849, G (Grad): So I {disfmarker} I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition
Turn 850, C (PhD): Alright , well .
Turn 851, G (Grad): and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said " well maybe we could have meetings down here " , but then I got email from them that said " no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . " So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .
Turn 852, A (PhD): What about Joachim , maybe he can {disfmarker}
Turn 853, E (Professor): But {disfmarker} but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .
Turn 854, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 855, E (Professor): Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but {disfmarker}
Turn 856, A (PhD): You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .
Turn 857, C (PhD): Well , and they 're already {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} these things are already recorded ,
Turn 858, G (Grad): Yep .
Turn 859, E (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 860, C (PhD): we don't have to ask them to {disfmarker} even {disfmarker} and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual {disfmarker}
Turn 861, E (Professor): n Well {disfmarker} No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones
Turn 862, C (PhD): Why {disfmarker} why not ?
Turn 863, E (Professor): because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .
Turn 864, C (PhD): Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC getting {pause} data , uh , and {disfmarker}
Turn 865, E (Professor): Right , that 's the found data idea .
Turn 866, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 867, E (Professor): But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .
Turn 868, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 869, E (Professor): And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere
Turn 870, C (PhD): Right . Great . OK .  
Turn 871, E (Professor): and uh {disfmarker} But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .
Turn 872, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 873, G (Grad): Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here .
Turn 874, C (PhD): That 's a good way to end a meeting .
Turn 875, E (Professor): OK . Well I don't {disfmarker} why don't we {disfmarker} why d u why don't we uh uh turn them {disfmarker} turn
Turn 876, G (Grad): OK , leave {disfmarker} leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .
Turn 877, B (Postdoc): Oh . That 's good to know .
Turn 878, E (Professor): Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well {disfmarker}
Turn 879, B (Postdoc): That 's good to know .
Turn 880, E (Professor): OK .
