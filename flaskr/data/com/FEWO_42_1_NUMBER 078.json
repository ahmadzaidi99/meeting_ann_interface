I am very happy and grateful for having the opportunity to address you on behalf of CEDAW. I am Professor Ruth Halperin-Kaddari. I'm vice-president of CEDAW, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. I participated in the most recent review of Canada by the committee. \n              The committee is the body of independent experts who monitor the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. CEDAW consists of 23 experts on women’s rights who are elected for a term of four years by states parties among their nationals and who serve in their personal capacity, consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of the different forms of civilization, as well as the principal legal systems. \n              Countries that have become party to the treaty are obliged to submit periodic reports to the committee on measures taken to ensure that the rights of the convention are implemented. During each of our sessions, the committee considers each of the state party's reports and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of concluding observations. \n              In accordance with the optional protocol to the convention, the committee is also mandated to receive communications from individuals, or groups of individuals, submitting claims of violations of rights protected under the convention and also to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women’s rights. These procedures are optional and are only available when the state concerned has accepted them by ratifying the said optional protocol. As you know, Canada had indeed ratified the optional protocol and CEDAW has conducted an inquiry into the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada. We issued our report in 2015. \n              During its 65th session, which took place in November of last year, the committee considered the eighth and ninth periodic reports of Canada and raised a number of concerns during the dialogue with the Canadian delegation, which are directly related to the work of your standing committee and its study on women’s economic security. I want to emphasize that the dialogue, the concerns we raised, and the concluding observations, are all based on information the committee received, both from the formal delegation, the formal state's report, and the replies to the list of issues and questions, as well as on information received from civil society and international NGOs.\n              With respect to the economic empowerment of women, the committee noted the development of a national poverty reduction strategy and a national housing strategy. Nevertheless, we expressed our concern about the fact that women continue to experience significant levels of poverty, homelessness, and hunger in Canada, especially when it relates to indigenous women, Afro-Canadian women, women of immigrant origin, women with disabilities, older women, and single mothers. We also expressed concern about the current severe housing shortage, in particular within indigenous communities, and the high cost of rent and the impact thereof on women, especially low-income women with families.\n              Regarding the issue of employment, we expressed our concern about persistent gender wage gaps in both the public and private sectors which adversely affect women’s career development and pension benefits, as well as the lack of effective legislation on the principle of equal pay for work of equal value at the federal level, even in the public sector, given that the Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act of 2009 has delivered practically no results, and the lack of such legislation in the private sector in most provinces and territories, as repeatedly noted by the International Labour Organization. \n              We were also concerned about the continuing horizontal and vertical occupational segregation and the concentration of women in part-time and low-paying jobs, which is often due to their parallel traditional child raising and caretaking responsibilities, as well as the low number of child care facilities and the low usage of parental leave by fathers.\n              \n               Also, we were concerned by the limited access of indigenous, Afro-Canadian, migrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking women as well as women with disabilities to the labour market, and the practice of issuing employer-specific closed work permits, which makes it challenging for migrant workers, including caregivers, to leave abusive employment situations. \n              We also addressed the root causes of violence and discrimination against indigenous women. We expressed concern about the fact that indigenous women continue to suffer from multiple forms of discrimination, in particular with regard to their access to employment, housing, education, and health care, and continue to live in poverty in Canada as reflected by very high poverty rates, poor health, inadequate housing, lack of access to safe water, and low school completion rates. We further noted with concern the low participation of indigenous women in the labour market, in particular in senior or decision-making positions, as well as their disproportionately high unemployment rates, and their lower pay compared with that of men and non-indigenous women. There is a lack of coherent plans or strategies to improve the socio-economic conditions of indigenous communities, in particular indigenous women, in order to combat the root causes of their vulnerability to violence. The connection and the interaction between economic vulnerability and exposures to violence are, of course, self-evident. \n              In terms of access to justice, which is key to ensuring the protection of women's economic and social rights, the committee expressed its concern that financial support for civil legal aid programs had considerably diminished in the past 20 years and has become increasingly restricted, affecting women in particular as they are the primary users of civil legal aid.\n              We were also concerned that income tests for eligibility limit civil legal aid to women living well below the poverty line, consequently denying low-income women access to legal representation and services. The information is lacking on whether the newly reinstated court challenges program, which provided funding for equality test cases, will be expanded to cover claims under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms so as to include economic and social equality issues relating to poverty, and whether it will fund equality rights challenges to provincial, territorial, and federal laws and preserve its community-based structure. \n              With regard to marriage and family relations, the committee noted with concern that the recently adopted Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interest or Rights Act does not apply to the first nations reserves that have enacted their own first nations matrimonial real property laws under the act or under the First Nations Land Management Act of 1999.\n              Accordingly, the committee formulated a number of recommendations directed at Canada that could, in fact, be read as a road map to further empower women and enhance their economic security. In line with our follow-up procedures, we requested that Canada provide within two years written information on the steps taken to implement the recommendations in paragraphs 21 and 27 of the concluding observations, which are related to the strengthening of the national machinery for the advancement of women and the development of a coordinated plan for the overseeing of the implementation of the 37 recommendations we issued in the inquiry report, which I mentioned before, on the murdered and missing indigenous women. \n              When we continue the conversation, I can present some comparative statistics in relation to women's economic situation in Canada but, Madam Chair, I think I will stop here. \n              Thank you."}, {"turn": 3, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much. \n              We're going to turn to Calgary Immigrant Women’s Association, and Beba Svigir.\n              You have 10 minutes."}, {"turn": 4, "speakerID": "208667", "name": "Ms. Beba Svigir (Chief Executive Officer, Calgary Immigrant Women’s Association)", "contribution": "Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and support the study of economic security of women in Canada. I'm appearing on behalf of the Calgary Immigrant Women's Association, and my feedback will be aligned with the agency's mandate to support newcomer immigrant women in Canada, particularly in Calgary, and the specific challenges they face relative to the study.\n              We are the largest settlement agency in Canada with a gender-specific mandate. Our mission is to engage all immigrant women who come to Calgary, and support successful integration of their families. CIWA provides services for around 15,000 clients each year, who come to us from 100 different countries and cultures. We do that through holistic and customized programming and services offered at CIWA offices in 99 community locations in Calgary.\n              We offer over 50 programs and services in the areas of settlement integration, literacy and language training, family and individual counselling, civic engagement, legal and tax clinics, health, housing, and community development.\n              While many of the issues of equity and equality for women in Canada are prominent in our ongoing social discourse, the disparity for immigrant and refugee women is compounded. According to Statistics Canada, immigrant women have lower employment rates, work in more part-time positions, or are underemployed and have lower pay equity than Canadian-born women, despite having comparable levels of education and experience. They take longer to reach Canadian-born levels of labour force participation compared to immigrant men.\n              There is a lot of research and speculation around the causes of inequity and inequality faced by immigrant and refugee women, in particular the role of policy and corporate acknowledgement of foreign credentials and language proficiency in English and/or French.\n              While credentialing and language proficiency are and will continue to be powerful gatekeepers for successful integration and economic prosperity, they do not illustrate the complexity of the barriers faced by many immigrant and refugee women. \n              Our approach to addressing the economic security of the immigrant women we serve is based on two distinct client groups: professionally trained immigrant women and immigrant women with limited or interrupted education from their home countries. For both groups, we have customized our approaches, piloted innovative best practices, and achieved successful economic outcomes over the years with proven social return on investment, as well as successful integration and social participation. We offer equitable, fair supports in ensuring that all immigrant women who come to us have access to employment supports to achieve their goals and dreams in Canada. \n              There are both commonalities and differences in the barriers faced by professional immigrant women and those with limited education. From a micro, personal view, many immigrant families suffer tremendous shifts in family dynamics and increased familial responsibilities upon arrival to Canada. \n              Regardless of backgrounds, immigrant and refugee families have left their social networks in their home countries, and there are increased pressures on them to both create a stable environment and support the integration of their children, a condition for this being parental ability to successfully integrate into the workplace. \n              Another phenomenon we have seen repeatedly is what we call role reversal. This is the increasing pressure for women to economically support the family due to integration challenges experienced by their spouses, in addition to raising and caring for children, even though they may not have worked back at home.\n              Finally, this restructuring of the family unit upon arrival to Canada and the economic and social pressures of immigration correlate with increased instances of domestic abuse in families of newcomer and refugee women. \n              An issue that affects both groups of women is access to affordable child care so that they can work. While there are subsidies in place to help families in need of affordable day care, oftentimes finding day care can be a struggle. The availability of child care for evenings and weekends is particularly challenging, because some of the women we surveyed cited willingness to do any job, such as cleaning or food services, anywhere, but many of those jobs have shifts in the evenings and at irregular hours. \n              \n               As we all know, many companies reduce costs significantly by offering part-time employment. On the one hand, this works for some women provided the hours offered align with their child care needs, but on the other hand, it compounds economic stresses for those who do not have access to full benefits. \n              For professional immigrant women in Canada, the necessity of picking up their children prior to the day care closing or caring for a sick child can influence the optics of their commitment to the company they work for. \n              We have 13 employment bridging programs. We work with our funders to cover child care costs and where appropriate, such as for longer-term programs, living allowances so that our clients can focus on learning and building skills for successful employment. This increases the cost of program delivery substantially, which can be a deterrent for governments and other funding bodies we approach. However, the speed of their transition to employment and job retention rates justify that investment. They serve as an example of best practice. We bring professionals to this country willing to work and expecting to work, so we should support the transition to work for both men and women. Over $2 billion annually is lost due to underutilization of immigrant skills in Canada.\n              Bridging employment can be cost-effective and successful not only for professionally trained immigrant women but also for those with limited education. I will share one example with you. One of the most innovative programs that we have at CIWA is child care training for low-literacy immigrant women. It's a full-time program for 11 months. It transitions immigrant women with limited education, who often are classified as not expected or not able to work in Canada due to lack of education, skills, and training.\n              Over the past nine years, women in this program were able to flourish and secure certification of employment as child care assistants. Some have started their own in-home day care. The employment and retention rate is 93% over the years. Their employers swear by them. Significant costs of programs like this one, for child care and living allowance for the duration of the program, are easily justified. The long-term savings as a result are even more significant. Around 180 clients over the years have secured employment and have been paying taxes. Without this program, the majority of these clients would be depending on social services. \n              We have been fortunate to work with funders in specific departments in government that recognize similar needs. Overall, there needs to be an acceptance and appreciation for the long-term outcomes that short-term investments in vulnerable people willing to work can produce. \n              Last, I'd like to reference the role of post-secondary institutions in the transition of immigrant and refugee women into employment. The typical path to employment for newcomers, and particularly professional ones, is to take the language training required for their profession, then transition to some academic upgrading that hopefully gets them to their fields of expertise. \n              For many professional immigrant women, there is a misconception that Canadian education will advance their careers and so they invest time and resources in retraining. Oftentimes it's at a master's level. However, the true barrier is opportunities for employment within their field; that is what they are lacking. Upon completing academic courses, many professional immigrant women take entry-level jobs, survival jobs in an entirely different field than their professional experience. They are never able to transfer into their original professions because their Canadian experience on their resumé typecasts them into survival industry instead. \n              It is hard to get that opportunity to get through the door for immigrant professionals, even after they achieve Canadian academic upgrading. Our bridging programs are offered in partnership with employers. We secure job placements for our clients for a period of 14 to 20 weeks. Many of our clients are hired by the employers we work with and employers continue working with us because it is a good and cheap hiring option for them.\n              Immigrant women with limited education have even more challenging and confusing options and experiences with educational institutions and industry hiring practices. As a society, we tend to value academic knowledge and traditional learning models and overlook the importance of competency development, which depends on learning skills and the ability to complete the task required on a particular job. \n              I'll go back to the previously mentioned child care training program."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Beba, we are at our 10 minutes.

I'm specifically asking about people who were raised in Canada, who went to school in Canada, but who still face these barriers. What do you think are the main reasons these barriers still exist?"}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "235160", "name": "Prof. Ruth Halperin-Kaddari", "contribution": "I can offer only my thoughts based on the information we were provided during the dialogue. \n              My understanding is that what we are witnessing here is the phenomenon that is often the case in many immigrant-absorbing countries in which communities of immigrants are placed or tend to stay together in closed communities and remain in closed clusters within the absorbing country. Many of the social patterns and social practices that have characterized those communities in the countries they come from are still entrenched within their communities even after immigration. \n              From the work we are doing on the committee, we can sometimes see models that may be somewhat successful in managing to change cultural and social practices through education and through agents of change within the communities themselves; programs that in a sense can recruit leaders from the communities and train them to become these agents of change for their own communities. \n              Canada is certainly not the only country that is facing such challenges, but our impression was that the programs Canada is employing so far are really short of what Canada can do, as a welfare country and a country with resources."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "234504", "name": "Ms. Emmanuella Lambropoulos", "contribution": "As a follow-up question to that, let's say that these people from various communities that are considered more marginalized have the same education as someone who isn't from one of those communities.

Education is obviously a key factor without which no social mobilization can take place, but it is a prerequisite, not the only requirement.

Once they have achieved academic upgrading, as you've mentioned, why are there still barriers after that point for these immigrant women?"}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "208667", "name": "Ms. Beba Svigir", "contribution": "What happens is that they take a few courses at a time, so that they can put them on their resumé, and they go and compete for jobs. In Canada, an accent can be a blessing or a curse. It's always in the eye of the beholder to take the responsibility to gauge the skills and language proficiency of people whom they are interviewing for jobs, and to assess the skills of foreign-trained people for those jobs. Very frequently, people who do interviews focus on one or the other more than is favourable for the immigrant women—and men, for that matter—to successfully compete for jobs.\n              Transitioning, providing culturally sensitive supports in preparing them to upgrade their skills and present them in what we call a Canadian acceptable way, is really sometimes an art. Very frequently, it takes a tiny sliver of measure by the interviewer to discard an excellent candidate with foreign training in favour of a Canadian-born candidate.\n              Biases experienced in interviews are documented. Obviously, nobody does it deliberately, but biases do exist. Settlement support, even for highly educated immigrants, is essential for the speed of their ability to integrate and for their expeditious involvement in the workplace.\n              We have clients who come to us after completing university courses to do our programs."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Excellent, thank you very much.\n              We are now going to Sylvie Boucher for her seven minutes."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "217688", "name": "Mrs. Sylvie Boucher (Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you, Madam Chair.\n              Hello everyone.\n              I am very pleased to be here, sitting in for Ms. Harder today on the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.

I remember that the former minister of immigration, Mr. Jason Kenney, had created that kind of program, but I don't think it exists any more.\n              With the mass arrival of immigrants, do immigrant women have more trouble finding work than immigrant men?\n              Does the fact that we do not recognize the skills of these women pose a long-term danger for them?"}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "208667", "name": "Ms. Beba Svigir", "contribution": "It has been a long-term risk for immigrant women and men over the decades. We are trying to address that issue by working collaboratively with the governments and the ministries.

We have more than 100,000 people who have been laid off in the last year or so. However, for the clients who come to us for supports for employment—and I mentioned that we have 13 clinical bridging programs—it is not. \n              As I mentioned, we have achieved a level of labour market involvement of our clients, overall, for all programs, of over 90%.

It is amazing that we have not had any decrease in the level of job acquisition for clients in the last two years, regardless of the economic downturn.

Can you elaborate on some of the statistics, where Canada sits in the world standings, and is there any hope of tightening or eliminating that gap in the absence of a legislated solution?"}, {"turn": 28, "speakerID": "235160", "name": "Prof. Ruth Halperin-Kaddari", "contribution": "Some of the statistics available to us put Canada in not the best place it could be with respect to its own resources and commitment to gender equality. That commitment is evident in many of Canada's initiatives and legislation, but the gap between the commitment and the reality is really disturbing. In relation to OECD countries, Canada is either the seventh or eighth state with respect to wage gaps between women and men. The numbers for women working full-time all year run anywhere from women making 70% of what men are making on average to their making a little less than 80% of what men are making. In terms of wage gaps, this performance is well below that of the leading countries in the OECD.\n              When it comes to other criteria or other data, the numbers are—"}, {"turn": 29, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "The parliamentary secretary could listen to the testimony.

Again, this is below the rate in many other countries, such as Australia, France, the U.K., or Iceland. The female share of seats on boards of the largest publicly listed companies is less than 20%, well below that of New Zealand, the U.K., Denmark, Finland, Italy, and France. Quotas and what we in CEDAW call temporary special measures are especially striking, because these have proven to work, although I shouldn't say easily, in other countries that have adopted them. \n              Concerning paid leave specifically for fathers, in 2016 there was no such legislated leave in Canada. I don't know whether this has changed since the report; I'm afraid it hasn't. We heard from the other testimony how significant a factor child-rearing responsibility is in impeding women's full integration into the job market. This again is something for the government to do federally, to legislate and ensure that the option of paid leave specifically for fathers is in place."}, {"turn": 31, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "I'm going to move you to a related area. We've heard a number of witnesses say that when there is a lack of affordable child care, it is the parent who makes less money who drops out of the workforce to provide that child care. That tends to be the woman. Because we have a lack of pay equity legislation, women tend to earn less and tend to be the ones who drop out of the market because they can't access affordable child care, because we don't have a national universal child care system. That means that when they return to the workforce, they disproportionately do part-time, precarious work. \n              Can you describe your observations about how the lack of affordable child care access in Canada is affecting women's economic justice?"}, {"turn": 32, "speakerID": "235160", "name": "Prof. Ruth Halperin-Kaddari", "contribution": "Absolutely. Again this is a universal phenomenon, and we cannot blame the individual couples or partners who are taking the most economically efficient choice they can take when their intention is simply to survive in the most economical manner they can.

Thank you.\n              I mentioned to you that we are the largest settlement organization with a gender-specific mandate in Canada. What has been done well in Calgary is investment into the needs assessment that we presented to the federal government. Certainly the majority of our funding in line with the portfolio of immigration comes from the federal government, including Status of Women.\n              We have managed as an organization to get through to the government officials and to explain the need for customized, and “customized” is really the word I would stress, approaches to supporting immigrant women so that they can expedite their integration.\n              I also mentioned that we have 13 different bridging programs, probably the largest number of programs in any settlement organization in Canada. That has been done well. We've received tremendous support from the federal government for our services.\n              Obviously, we need much more investment in our services on any given day, but every city and bigger centre that receives immigrants should have similar services, whether that's through organizations that serve only women or adding women-specific approaches in organizations that already provide settlement services.\n              There has been a lot of discussion about the role of academic institutions and how they complement the work that settlement organizations are doing. That's another thing that requires a little more vested analysis so that this collaboration can produce effective results and provide that social return on investment.\n              Child care issues and more investment into providing child care support for immigrant women while they are taking courses is absolutely essential, because immigrant women do not have natural supports in Canada. They don't have mothers, grandmothers, aunts, and uncles to help them.

The challenge is more on that part of the equation than with respect to women, who may also be experiencing difficulties in transition, but my impression at least, from what we have seen and heard, is not that it impedes them, but rather that it impedes their male partners and then, of course, presents a challenge for them as well."}, {"turn": 44, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              We're going to move into our second round and we're going to start with Earl Dreeshen for five minutes."}, {"turn": 45, "speakerID": "217676", "name": "Mr. Earl Dreeshen", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              Ms. Kaddari, I'd like to go back to explain where I was going in the few minutes I had to describe what was involved with matrimonial property rights.

However, the Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act provisions do not apply to those first nations reserves that had enacted their own first nations matrimonial real property laws, so this means that there is inconsistent application in practice creating an uneven application of matrimonial property laws and emergency protection measures, most often needed by women and their children across first nations reserve communities in Canada. \n              At present, there are no guidelines or minimum standards of protection for women or children that must be incorporated by first nations if they create their own matrimonial property regime."}, {"turn": 49, "speakerID": "217676", "name": "Mr. Earl Dreeshen", "contribution": "If I could, I'll just stop you.

That is the point that I'd hoped we'd be able to flesh out on that. Many items that you have indicated are very significant, and we do have groups and organizations that no doubt will take a look at them and make decisions as to the relevancy based on what we see on the ground.

You mentioned a point about foreign credentials. At Red Deer College we had a number of people get together. These women—computer scientists, chemists, medical professionals—were there talking about the issues and concerns they had, and of course, they were also talking about their appreciation for the great work that CAIWA and the Calgary Immigrant Women's Association do, so you're doing amazing work.\n              The concerns that they had were, of course, how the accreditations are done. Men have the same issue as well. The point is that, as was mentioned earlier, they seem to be in more survival industry jobs to keep them going, which makes it more difficult for them to go and get the accreditation.

That's why with accredited positions it takes longer for immigrants to be processed. For accreditation, typically, the post-secondary institutions have taken it on because of the requirement for a high level of education.\n              We actually do work with one accredited position in our bridging program, which is accounting. Our programs offer certification as opposed to accreditation. Women that go through our programs have done so much better than the ones who came to us and spoke about, after they had received accreditation, the difficulties in actually getting into the industry with that accreditation. Those are the differences that I can speak to in this short time.\n              What it all boils down to is understanding the needs of immigrants and accrediting bodies, post-secondary institutions, and settlement organizations that have the capacity and skills to provide certification/accreditation working together to understand the root causes of disparity in Canada, and efficiently utilizing the skills that immigrants, in our case immigrant women, have to actually get them through the process so they can access their original professions in Canada."}, {"turn": 51, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much.

My name is Frances McRae. I am the assistant deputy minister for small business, tourism and marketplace services at the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. The acronym I will be using is ISED.\n              \n              In French, it is ISDE.\n              Last February, my predecessor, Ms. Shereen Benzvy Miller, addressed this committee and outlined how ISED is supporting the economic empowerment of women. It is my pleasure to provide an update on ISED's activities since our last appearance.\n              \n              Canada is a world leader on gender equality, but we do have some challenges on the economic advancement of women, as you well know. I'll talk a bit about our sense of how the situation looks for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs.\n              I have a few facts to start. Only about 15.7% of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are majority owned by women in comparison to 64.6% majority owned by men. You may have seen a recent survey of more than 900 Canadian tech firms done by a new company called MoveTheDial and MaRS Discovery District, which found that women “account for just 5 per cent of CEO roles and 13 per cent of executive team positions, while more than half—53 per cent—of tech companies have no female executives. On average, women account for 8 per cent of director roles, while 73 per cent of firms have no women on their boards.”\n              A study in June 2017, by McKinsey Global Institute, which you're likely familiar with, found that improving women's equality in the workforce by 2026 could increase Canadian GDP by $150 billion.\n              \n              As you know, the economic empowerment of Canadian women is a key component in Canada's economic prosperity and was highlighted in Budget 2017.\n              \n              Women's entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a key source of employment creation and advancing women's equality. We have found it helpful to think about women in entrepreneurship and women in business as a continuum. They grow and develop along their entrepreneurship journey, from young girls and women needing exposure to entrepreneurship and opportunities in STEM, science, technology, engineering, math, as you well know, through accessing financing, business supports, and mentoring in order to start and grow their businesses. At the other end of the continuum are experienced business owners and leaders who need procurement and export opportunities, leadership advancement, and access to corporate boards.\n              I'd like to give the committee an update on activities that ISED supports to help women along this journey. \n              If I go back to the idea of a continuum, the first stage is exposure to entrepreneurship and STEM. For instance, CanCode is investing $50 million over two years starting in 2017-18 to support educational opportunities for coding and digital skills development for Canadian girls and youth.\n              As I move along the continuum, women benefit greatly from business skills support training. For example, the regional development agencies, which are part of the ISED portfolio, fund entrepreneurship development and women-directed business training across the country.\n              \n              Women also need financing in order to start and scale-up their businesses. For example, we indicated at our last appearance that the Business Development Bank of Canada had committed to investing $700 million by 2018 in women-owned businesses. \n              I am pleased to report that BDC has exceeded this commitment. As of September 30, 2017, $809 million had been authorized over 30 months. We surpassed the target of $700 million that the Bank had set. The Bank's portfolio of majority women-owned businesses is now at 4,744 clients, a 41% increase from the start of the initiative.\n              \n              \n               Announced in November 2016, BDC's women in tech fund extends $50 million in venture and growth capital to women-led tech firms, targeting early-stage and growing companies.\n              BDC will also deliver a new $400-million venture capital catalyst initiative, which was announced in budget 2017, to provide late-stage venture capital to Canadian entrepreneurs, obviously including women entrepreneurs.\n              The BDC has partnerships as well. The Women's Enterprise Centre of Manitoba provides loans of up to $150,000, and through a new co-lending agreement signed in June 2017 with the centre, BDC will provide an additional $100,000 to businesses that require more capital.\n              Finally, BDC has also undertaken a full review of its services to women entrepreneurs. It's expected to release its findings shortly.\n              As women move along the growth pathway, especially women transitioning to high growth, their needs become more complex. Like all entrepreneurs, they need access to experienced business mentors and targeted supports. I'll give you a couple of examples of how ISED supports organizations that help women-owned businesses grow.\n              \n              There is Futurpreneur, which offered business training and mandatory mentoring to over 400 young women entrepreneurs last year.\n              \n              Fierce Founders, a Waterloo-based tech accelerator that is part of an industry-led innovation centre known as Communitech and funded by FedDev Ontario, is designed to provide seed funding and mentorship to women-led businesses. Since the program's launch in 2014, Communitech has seen an increase in women engaging in its start-up services, and now sees 25.9% of its active start-ups with at least one female founder.\n              For women with mature businesses in the last stages of the continuum—and I'll wrap up shortly on that—we seek to help them export and provide procurement opportunities. For instance, ISED recently launched Innovative Solutions Canada, a new procurement program announced in budget 2017. To maximize inclusiveness, particular effort is going to be made to encourage procurement from under-represented groups, including women.\n               The government has also taken steps to advance the number of women on boards and in senior management. Bill  C-25, which is currently at second reading in the Senate, would require publicly traded companies under the Canada Business Corporations Act to disclose information on the gender diversity of their boards and senior management.\n              Finally, I will mention an initiative that we anticipate will provide recommendations along the continuum. You will recall that in February 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau and U.S. President Trump announced the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. The council is focusing on five areas: increasing the number of women in STEM; encouraging women to start businesses; growing women-owned businesses; increasing women's access to capital; and advancing women as leaders in the private sector. These areas align with ISED's priority areas of support for women entrepreneurs, and we anticipate seeing recommendations over the coming months.\n              \n              To close, Canada is a world leader in gender equality.

One of them is a bit personal to me, so I apologize in advance if I get a bit emotional.\n              A year and a half ago, my daughter was born very prematurely. She weighed just a little over two pounds, and spent about three months in the hospital. One of the programs that was a massive help to my family was the benefits for parents of critically ill children. \n              With today's change, I understand that the benefits will be accessible by family members who may not be parents of the child who is critically ill.

It is being extended to 35 weeks.

One thing we've heard from other witnesses who testified on the issue of access to child care in smaller communities is that having some flexibility—the extra $20 to put towards a nanny in a private home—is something that is very helpful to women, particularly to entrepreneurs who don't have a set schedule. \n              Can you elaborate on the impact the Canada child benefit has had on promoting women in the economy and the workforce?"}, {"turn": 79, "speakerID": "236168", "name": "Ms. Kristen Underwood", "contribution": "It's not really my spot to talk about the Canada child benefit.

This benefit is simpler, more generous, and better targeted, so that nine out of 10 families are better off than under the former suite of programs.\n              Specifically in terms of your question about impact, this has resulted in about 300,000 fewer children living in poverty, which represents a reduction of about 40% in child poverty."}, {"turn": 81, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              Shifting gears to the topic of housing, right now in budget 2017 we've announced $11 billion, I believe, towards housing.

It has been established to ensure that more Canadians have access to housing that meets their needs and that they can afford. In support of this, budget 2016 proposed to invest $11.2 billion over 11 years, starting in 2017-18, in a variety of initiatives designed to build, renew, and repair the stock of affordable housing to ensure that Canadians have affordable housing. \n              In addition, through the homelessness partnership strategy, the government has announced an extension of $2.5 billion over the next 11 years. This is a unique community-based program aimed at preventing and reducing homelessness by providing direct support and funding to 61 designated communities in all provinces and territories. \n              As I said, these programs will benefit both men and women.

Is that related to their family situation?\n              We also have the same problem in politics. We cannot attract women, and that is not necessarily because of the political party or some other reason.

The research shows that women are not always aware of the available sources of support. That is part of the answer. BDC also noted that women often arrive with a very detailed business plan, but do not really want to start a business without being sure that everything is complete. The male entrepreneurs who approach the BCD, on the other hand, are more likely to be seeking help in developing a business plan. There is no specific reason for this.

We do know that this is not just one single homogeneous group.\n               At the moment, the data we have is not particularly sophisticated in terms of splitting out the needs.

We've also improved the EI caregiver benefit by allowing medical doctors and now nurse practitioners to sign medical certificates. That's particularly helpful for people in rural areas where there's less access to medical practitioners.\n              There are new options created around EI parental benefits to extend the parental benefits to 61 weeks over an 18-month period. That's at a 33% benefit rate. Parents can now choose between a 35-week option for parental benefits at 55%, or 61 weeks at 33%. Added to the maternity, that goes up to 18 months or a year, depending on what they've chosen. Because it's over an extended period of time, it creates more flexibility, allowing parents to have more choice in how they might share that parental leave.\n              Changes were also made to allow EI maternity benefits to be—"}, {"turn": 137, "speakerID": "235144", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Sorry, I was really listening there too, and I let that go way over time.

There was a discussion on Bill C-25, which is now at second reading in the Senate. I was on the committee that studied that. One of the frustrations was that, as far as quotas are concerned, or decisions, it was all being left to regulation versus being affixed to the legislation that was there. \n              Has there been discussion within the department as to how this will be dealt with on a regulatory framework, or is it still the thought that you'll wait until it finally comes back to your department to initiate?"}, {"turn": 141, "speakerID": "236064", "name": "Ms. Frances McRae", "contribution": "To be honest, the actual work around Bill C-25 is done in another part of my department, so on that specific question about where the next steps are, I would have to come back later with that.\n              I will just say one thing, if you'll allow me to, on Bill C-25.

This is really critical. \n              We are also seeing that a lot of these folks, men and women, whom we are training are leaving the country. We're seeing a brain drain. We go to all this work and effort, and then the opportunities that are there are either picked up by Silicon Valley, Israel, or another of these different groups that really look at and nurture that kind of talent. \n              I'm just wondering if we're finding ways of helping, or thinking about doing so in the future. It's one thing to say we're going to train, but if we don't have the opportunities or we're putting up barriers that are causing issues.... One of the barriers that was discussed had to do with child care.

In fact, we need to look at the full continuum, from school age all the way through to mature women-owned businesses, and really analyze the gaps and needs all the way along that continuum.

We had Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters in earlier this week. They recently finished a survey on women in STEM and women in skilled trades and why they don't stay in the manufacturing sector. The number one reason they don't stay is the sexism in the workplace and what they have to deal with. It was really an interesting report. They provided us with copies of it. They have five pillars of how to encourage more women to be involved and to stay involved. We need to increase the women in STEM and we need to provide mentorship. However, none of them addressed the issue of the sexism in the workplace, which is the reason people leave. \n              You have a lot of the same types of directives, of increasing the number of women in STEM and mentorship, but if women aren't getting involved because of what they face in the workplace, shouldn't we be dealing with that problem first?"}, {"turn": 149, "speakerID": "236064", "name": "Ms. Frances McRae", "contribution": "You're absolutely right that there are many reasons, and the environmental factors in the workplace culture are obviously part of what women face. We're finding that many organizations, such as Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters but also private corporations, are seeing that they have a role to play in ensuring men in the workplace are also part of the solution, whether as leaders or as peers. \n              I was just looking at a transcript of a conversation that Minister Duncan had at a gender summit held earlier this week. One of the things that was noted was that, for example, men in a workplace could make a big difference by just saying to a woman colleague, “There's a job opportunity; I think you'd be great for that.” That respect and acknowledgement of capability goes a long way, so you're absolutely right about that.\n              In regard to Bill C-25, we believe one of the first important steps in addressing what's actually happening in workplaces is to have people understand what's going on in the sense of encouraging companies to think about what their numbers look like.

The mandatory mentoring of over 400 women entrepreneurs last year is phenomenal. I applaud that, and it's a great program.

One challenge we face in rural and remote communities with women working from home is their access to reliable Internet. \n              I'm just going to put that out as another thing that we need to consider. If we want people to work from home, we have to be able to give them the tools to do it. Women have a stronger tendency to work from home.
