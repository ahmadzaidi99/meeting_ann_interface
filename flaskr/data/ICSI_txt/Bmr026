Turn 0, A (Grad): OK , we 're on .
Turn 1, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 2, A (Grad): So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?
Turn 3, F (PhD): Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .
Turn 4, C (PhD): Is that English ?
Turn 5, F (PhD): Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago
Turn 6, D (PhD): That 's our system .
Turn 7, A (Grad): Ugh !
Turn 8, F (PhD): and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .
Turn 9, A (Grad): C can I have a pen ?
Turn 10, F (PhD): Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .
Turn 11, C (PhD): Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .
Turn 12, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 13, F (PhD): Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers
Turn 14, D (PhD): Speaking {disfmarker}
Turn 15, E (Grad): Which meetings is she transcribing ?
Turn 16, F (PhD): and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .
Turn 17, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 18, C (PhD): For IBM , yeah .
Turn 19, D (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 20, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 21, F (PhD): and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .
Turn 22, D (PhD): So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM
Turn 23, E (Grad): So we 're doing some in parallel .
Turn 24, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 25, F (PhD): No .
Turn 26, A (Grad): No , no .
Turn 27, F (PhD): Oh no no .
Turn 28, A (Grad): We haven't done that process .
Turn 29, D (PhD): no ?
Turn 30, F (PhD): No . We 're not waiting on them .
Turn 31, A (Grad): So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .
Turn 32, D (PhD): Oh . Oh , OK .
Turn 33, E (Grad): So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}
Turn 34, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 35, D (PhD): Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .
Turn 36, F (PhD): We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .
Turn 37, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 38, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 39, D (PhD): Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich
Turn 40, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 41, D (PhD): and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .
Turn 42, A (Grad): Yep , sounds familiar .
Turn 43, D (PhD): And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,
Turn 44, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 45, D (PhD): um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 46, C (PhD): There 's only two channels . So it 's only {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 47, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 48, C (PhD): As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .
Turn 49, D (PhD): It 's only two {disfmarker} Right , s
Turn 50, C (PhD): So .
Turn 51, D (PhD): Yeah . So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}
Turn 52, B (Professor): So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,
Turn 53, D (PhD): Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading
Turn 54, B (Professor): right ? So . Yeah .
Turn 55, D (PhD): and they just may {disfmarker}
Turn 56, A (Grad): Make sure it 's right .
Turn 57, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 58, D (PhD): And so um , um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}
Turn 59, B (Professor): Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}
Turn 60, D (PhD): Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .
Turn 61, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 62, D (PhD): Yeah . OK , yeah .
Turn 63, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 64, D (PhD): Alrighty .
Turn 65, F (PhD): Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 66, A (Grad): Can you mail that out to the list ?
Turn 67, F (PhD): Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I {disfmarker} That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages
Turn 68, A (Grad): Oh , OK , OK .
Turn 69, F (PhD): and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .
Turn 70, A (Grad): Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .
Turn 71, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 72, A (Grad): I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .
Turn 73, B (Professor): You are going to {disfmarker}
Turn 74, A (Grad): I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits . And then bleep them out .
Turn 75, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 76, A (Grad): For the ones that we have . Um {disfmarker}
Turn 77, C (PhD): So but it 's just transcripts , not the {disfmarker} not the audio ?
Turn 78, A (Grad): Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .
Turn 79, C (PhD): OK , yeah , yep . Ah .
Turn 80, A (Grad): I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right .
Turn 81, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 82, F (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 83, A (Grad): So you want people to be able to listen to them .
Turn 84, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 85, F (PhD): So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and {disfmarker}
Turn 86, A (Grad): Oh , that 's a good point . That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .
Turn 87, F (PhD): Hmm . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on
Turn 88, A (Grad): Well , that was the other point .
Turn 89, F (PhD): Oh , was that another one ?
Turn 90, A (Grad): Yep , that 's another agenda item .
Turn 91, F (PhD): OK . I 'll wait .
Turn 92, A (Grad): So , uh {disfmarker} But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID . So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . Uh {disfmarker} The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and {disfmarker} and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .
Turn 93, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 94, A (Grad): But uh {pause} the back - end was pretty smooth .
Turn 95, B (Professor): Oh
Turn 96, A (Grad): So I think , we 'll have something . It may not be as {disfmarker} As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .
Turn 97, B (Professor): I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . He 's sort of been {disfmarker} been volunteering for everything
Turn 98, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 99, B (Professor): and {pause} and uh {disfmarker}
Turn 100, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 101, B (Professor): O K . Finally said he was too busy . I guess we reached it .
Turn 102, A (Grad): Yeah , he {disfmarker} he actually {disfmarker} he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . So . Oh well . Um {disfmarker}
Turn 103, E (Grad): And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it {disfmarker} with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom
Turn 104, A (Grad): Oh , cool .
Turn 105, E (Grad): so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it {disfmarker} think it has potential for a little something ,
Turn 106, A (Grad): For a demo ?
Turn 107, E (Grad): yeah , for a demo .
Turn 108, A (Grad): Yeah , sounds good .
Turn 109, E (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 110, B (Professor): OK , so again , the issue is {disfmarker} For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but {disfmarker}
Turn 111, E (Grad): Oh . OK .
Turn 112, A (Grad): So it might just be slides .
Turn 113, E (Grad): Yeah , OK .
Turn 114, C (PhD): Well {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .
Turn 115, E (Grad): Well , we 'll see , um {disfmarker}
Turn 116, C (PhD): I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work .
Turn 117, D (PhD): Really ? So is that {disfmarker} Because there 's some people um {disfmarker} It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at {disfmarker} at SRI
Turn 118, C (PhD): Yeah . Yep .
Turn 119, D (PhD): because the um {disfmarker}
Turn 120, A (Grad): Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,
Turn 121, D (PhD): we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the {disfmarker}
Turn 122, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 123, A (Grad): so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .
Turn 124, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 125, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker} But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on {disfmarker} on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to {disfmarker} to the author of {disfmarker} to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library
Turn 126, A (Grad): Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?
Turn 127, C (PhD): and so it works . Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the {disfmarker} the new version is {disfmarker} is totally different
Turn 128, A (Grad): Oh .
Turn 129, C (PhD): a and in {disfmarker} yeah , in terms of {disfmarker} of the source code .
Turn 130, A (Grad): Ah .
Turn 131, C (PhD): You {disfmarker} you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing
Turn 132, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 133, C (PhD): and you can't {disfmarker} you can't access that so you have to install {disfmarker} First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches .
Turn 134, A (Grad): Patch . Ugh !
Turn 135, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I wonder if {disfmarker} if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along {disfmarker}
Turn 136, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 137, A (Grad): We have {disfmarker} Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .
Turn 138, D (PhD): We have ? Oh . Oh , OK .
Turn 139, F (PhD): So did you um put the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or {disfmarker}
Turn 140, C (PhD): No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm {disfmarker} oh Nope . But I definitely will do that .
Turn 141, B (Professor): So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the {disfmarker}
Turn 142, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 143, C (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 144, E (Grad): Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different {disfmarker} It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 145, D (PhD): So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Turn 146, E (Grad): I mean we could do it in Matl - {comment} I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .
Turn 147, D (PhD): But {disfmarker} But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the {disfmarker} you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is {disfmarker} that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .
Turn 148, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 149, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 150, B (Professor): Yes .
Turn 151, E (Grad): Yeah , that 'd be very cool .
Turn 152, A (Grad): It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's {disfmarker} it 's {pause} It 's more Tcl - T
Turn 153, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 154, A (Grad): So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,
Turn 155, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 156, A (Grad): but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .
Turn 157, D (PhD): Right . But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .
Turn 158, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 159, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 160, D (PhD): S
Turn 161, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 162, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 163, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , maybe we could l look into that .
Turn 164, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 165, A (Grad): But it {disfmarker} it seems to me that I c
Turn 166, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 167, A (Grad): It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images .
Turn 168, E (Grad): Um {pause} What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like {disfmarker}
Turn 169, F (PhD): Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .
Turn 170, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 171, A (Grad): Yeah , jus Yeah .
Turn 172, F (PhD): Is that what you mean ?
Turn 173, A (Grad): It just seems to me jus
Turn 174, E (Grad): It would be cool to see it {disfmarker}
Turn 175, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 176, E (Grad): It would be cool like to see {disfmarker} to hear it and see it ,
Turn 177, C (PhD): And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 178, E (Grad): and see the pitch contours also .
Turn 179, A (Grad): Sure , but I don't think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} You can do all that just statically in
Turn 180, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 181, E (Grad): I think it would lose {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean y
Turn 182, A (Grad): Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 183, E (Grad): Right , right . I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just {pause} like {pause} um view graphs or something .
Turn 184, B (Professor): You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and {disfmarker} and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,
Turn 185, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 186, B (Professor): we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , {vocalsound} the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think {disfmarker} {pause} For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it
Turn 187, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 188, B (Professor): so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . But , um {disfmarker} Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in {disfmarker} {pause} to people .
Turn 189, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 190, B (Professor): Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .
Turn 191, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 192, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 193, A (Grad): And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're {disfmarker} We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .
Turn 194, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 195, A (Grad): And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data {pause} all at once , in a lot of different ways .
Turn 196, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 197, F (PhD): Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .
Turn 198, A (Grad): Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers ,
Turn 199, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 200, A (Grad): so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,
Turn 201, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 202, C (PhD): An
Turn 203, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 204, A (Grad): so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um {disfmarker} And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we {disfmarker} we just got these hundred {disfmarker} alright , excuse me {disfmarker} ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .
Turn 205, B (Professor): Did they come in ?
Turn 206, F (PhD): SUN - Blades .
Turn 207, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 208, F (PhD): Yeah . They came in the other day .
Turn 209, A (Grad): They came in but they 're not set up yet .
Turn 210, B (Professor): Oh .
Turn 211, A (Grad): And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those {pause} because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .
Turn 212, F (PhD): Well , is there {disfmarker} Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a {disfmarker}
Turn 213, A (Grad): Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .
Turn 214, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 215, F (PhD): Ah .
Turn 216, B (Professor): Weren't we gonna get {disfmarker}
Turn 217, F (PhD): Ah , I see .
Turn 218, B (Professor): Well , maybe it should get another rack .
Turn 219, D (PhD): But you still need to store the disks somehow .
Turn 220, A (Grad): Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays .
Turn 221, D (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 222, A (Grad): Just put them in .
Turn 223, F (PhD): You can put two {disfmarker}
Turn 224, D (PhD): Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the {disfmarker}
Turn 225, A (Grad): Sure .
Turn 226, C (PhD): Internal . Yeah .
Turn 227, A (Grad): Yeah . Cuz the SUN {disfmarker} uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives .
Turn 228, D (PhD): Oh .
Turn 229, A (Grad): So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .
Turn 230, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 231, B (Professor): But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} file server {comment} it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .
Turn 232, D (PhD): Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .
Turn 233, A (Grad): Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ?
Turn 234, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 235, D (PhD): I see {vocalsound} {pause} Oh , I see .
Turn 236, B (Professor): Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,
Turn 237, A (Grad): Oh , I didn't know he had left already .
Turn 238, B (Professor): Uh , well , tonight .
Turn 239, A (Grad): Oh , oh well .
Turn 240, D (PhD): You mean he won't set up the {disfmarker} mmm .
Turn 241, B (Professor): I don't know .
Turn 242, E (Grad): How much space do you need for these ?
Turn 243, B (Professor): I don't know what his schedule is .
Turn 244, A (Grad): You {disfmarker} we need about a gig per meeting .
Turn 245, B (Professor): I 'm just saying he 's gone .
Turn 246, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 247, F (PhD): I {disfmarker} I thi
Turn 248, E (Grad): I have um {disfmarker} I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .
Turn 249, A (Grad): Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ?
Turn 250, E (Grad): So {disfmarker} Uh , Samosa .
Turn 251, B (Professor): You had an eighteen gigabyte drive .
Turn 252, E (Grad): Yeah , I had . Well it 's about {disfmarker} I think there 's about twelve gig left .
Turn 253, A (Grad): So it {disfmarker} And you have an X drives installed ? OK .
Turn 254, E (Grad): Yeah . So , I didn't realize it was so critical .
Turn 255, A (Grad): And you 're o you 're offering ?
Turn 256, E (Grad): I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are {disfmarker} new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything .
Turn 257, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 258, E (Grad): Um not that I can't do anything , I jus
Turn 259, F (PhD): I {disfmarker} I jus I just gave Thilo some {disfmarker} about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on {disfmarker} on uh Abbott . Uh {disfmarker} And uh {disfmarker} So but that {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Turn 260, A (Grad): Which one was that , X {pause} G ? X {pause} G ?
Turn 261, C (PhD): XG .
Turn 262, F (PhD): XG .
Turn 263, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 264, D (PhD): XG ?
Turn 265, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 266, D (PhD): That 's also where we store the {disfmarker} The uh Hub - five training set waveforms ,
Turn 267, C (PhD): Oops .
Turn 268, A (Grad): But that won't be getting any bigger ,
Turn 269, D (PhD): right ?
Turn 270, F (PhD): No .
Turn 271, A (Grad): will it ?
Turn 272, F (PhD): I don't think that 's on XG .
Turn 273, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 274, F (PhD): On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk .
Turn 275, C (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 276, D (PhD): But I 've also been storing {disfmarker} I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are
Turn 277, E (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 278, D (PhD): and we won't be using the old ones anymore .
Turn 279, E (Grad): I have a lot of space , though .
Turn 280, F (PhD): Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG .
Turn 281, D (PhD): Uh {disfmarker} Oh thats XA {disfmarker} Oh that 's X {disfmarker}
Turn 282, C (PhD): Isn't that XH ?
Turn 283, F (PhD): I th
Turn 284, A (Grad): Not {disfmarker} not for long .
Turn 285, E (Grad): I have a lot of space and it 's not {disfmarker} it 's n There 's very little uh {disfmarker} Yeah not for long .
Turn 286, D (PhD): Maybe I 'm confu
Turn 287, E (Grad): But I mean it 's not going f
Turn 288, D (PhD): Oh no I 'm sorry .
Turn 289, E (Grad): It 's not being used often at all .
Turn 290, C (PhD): But I 'm using XH {disfmarker} H , too .
Turn 291, A (Grad): Yeah , it 's probably {disfmarker} Probably only about four gig is on X {disfmarker} on your X drive ,
Turn 292, C (PhD): So .
Turn 293, D (PhD): Oh OK .
Turn 294, A (Grad): but we 'll definitely take it up if you {disfmarker}
Turn 295, E (Grad): I th
Turn 296, D (PhD): I think you 're right . It 's XH and D {disfmarker}
Turn 297, E (Grad): I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there ,
Turn 298, D (PhD): The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused .
Turn 299, E (Grad): three or four meetings .
Turn 300, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 301, A (Grad): Great .
Turn 302, E (Grad): So .
Turn 303, A (Grad): OK , so that will get us through the next couple days .
Turn 304, B (Professor): We need {disfmarker} We need another gigaquad .
Turn 305, A (Grad): Yep . At least .
Turn 306, B (Professor): There should {disfmarker} I d There should just be a b I should have a button .
Turn 307, A (Grad): The " more disk space " button ?
Turn 308, B (Professor): Just press {disfmarker} Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " {vocalsound} " this week " .
Turn 309, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 310, B (Professor): Skip the rest of the conversation .
Turn 311, F (PhD): Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings .
Turn 312, B (Professor): And {disfmarker} And how much does each meeting take ?
Turn 313, F (PhD): And it 's about a gig uncompressed .
Turn 314, C (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} It 's a little bit more as I usually don't {disfmarker} do not uncompress the {disfmarker} all of the PZM and the PDA things .
Turn 315, F (PhD): Is a little more ?
Turn 316, C (PhD): So .
Turn 317, F (PhD): Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more .
Turn 318, C (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . One point five or something .
Turn 319, F (PhD): U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like {disfmarker}
Turn 320, A (Grad): Half a gig . For all of them .
Turn 321, F (PhD): About half ?
Turn 322, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yep .
Turn 323, F (PhD): So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?
Turn 324, B (Professor): So - so So maybe there 's a hundred {pause} gig or something . Or {disfmarker} I mean . Cuz we {disfmarker} we have the uncompressed around also .
Turn 325, F (PhD): Mm - hmm . Right .
Turn 326, B (Professor): So it 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 327, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 328, F (PhD): Right . Well we {disfmarker} We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but {disfmarker}
Turn 329, A (Grad): I would like to .
Turn 330, B (Professor): Yeah . Well I mean it 's {disfmarker} the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,
Turn 331, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 332, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 333, B (Professor): but But uh , we could {disfmarker} You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's small {disfmarker} I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .
Turn 334, F (PhD): Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for {disfmarker} if we could get some disk .
Turn 335, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 336, F (PhD): I s I sent this out a {disfmarker} a day ago
Turn 337, A (Grad): And put it where ?
Turn 338, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 339, F (PhD): but {disfmarker} and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and {disfmarker} if it 's OK , and {disfmarker}
Turn 340, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 341, F (PhD): So I was assuming he was gonna take over {pause} that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .
Turn 342, B (Professor): Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just {vocalsound} say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " So I mean I think {pause} that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " .
Turn 343, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 344, A (Grad): Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . So they don't want to stack up external drives .
Turn 345, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 346, A (Grad): Um {disfmarker} {pause} And then they want everything else in the machine room .
Turn 347, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 348, A (Grad): So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?
Turn 349, F (PhD): Mm - hmm . I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .
Turn 350, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 351, F (PhD): So .
Turn 352, B (Professor): Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,
Turn 353, D (PhD): Th - The {disfmarker}
Turn 354, F (PhD): I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the {disfmarker} the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .
Turn 355, B (Professor): cuz it {disfmarker}
Turn 356, D (PhD): One {disfmarker} Mmm .
Turn 357, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 358, D (PhD): One {disfmarker} One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is
Turn 359, F (PhD): So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .
Turn 360, D (PhD): I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and {disfmarker} and you know recover the space .
Turn 361, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 362, B (Professor): Yeah . No . I think Dave {disfmarker} Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .
Turn 363, D (PhD): Right . Mm - hmm .
Turn 364, A (Grad): But I {disfmarker} I know that {pause} generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back {disfmarker} the {pause} back up system , rather than on new disk .
Turn 365, D (PhD): Mmm . Mmm .
Turn 366, A (Grad): So . Which {disfmarker}
Turn 367, B (Professor): Well . So . But this {disfmarker} this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get {pause} one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . Uh , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him .
Turn 368, D (PhD): Maybe we can put some disks in the {disfmarker} in that back room there .
Turn 369, A (Grad): Yeah really .
Turn 370, B (Professor): Attach to {disfmarker}
Turn 371, A (Grad): Popcorn .
Turn 372, B (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 373, D (PhD): To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there .
Turn 374, A (Grad): Yeah , it 's just {disfmarker} It 's not on the net , so it 's a little {pause} awkward
Turn 375, D (PhD): The only {disfmarker}
Turn 376, F (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 377, D (PhD): What do you mean it 's not on the net ?
Turn 378, A (Grad): It 's not {disfmarker}
Turn 379, C (PhD): It 's not bad .
Turn 380, A (Grad): It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S
Turn 381, D (PhD): Oh because it 's {disfmarker} because it 's an ACIRI machine ?
Turn 382, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 383, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 384, D (PhD): Oh , oh oh .
Turn 385, A (Grad): And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ?
Turn 386, D (PhD): But that can't be that hard .
Turn 387, F (PhD): That might be a good short term solution , though .
Turn 388, D (PhD): I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 389, A (Grad): No , the {disfmarker} the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room {pause} that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .
Turn 390, D (PhD): Oh ,
Turn 391, A (Grad): So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .
Turn 392, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} jus every ever everybody {disfmarker} everybody has a {disfmarker} has {disfmarker}
Turn 393, A (Grad): But Dave has to do all of them .
Turn 394, B (Professor): Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . But at any rate I think that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a {disfmarker} a conversation with {disfmarker} Uh , maybe {disfmarker} maybe after {disfmarker} after tea or something you and I can go down and {disfmarker} and talk to him about it Just say " wha you know , what should we do right now ? "
Turn 395, F (PhD): How long is David gonna be gone ?
Turn 396, B (Professor): Uh , eleven days or something ?
Turn 397, A (Grad): Oh my !
Turn 398, B (Professor): Yeah basically tomorrow and all of {pause} the week after .
Turn 399, A (Grad): And that 's all I have .
Turn 400, B (Professor): Um {disfmarker} Let 's see . The only oth thing {disfmarker} other thing I was gonna add was that um {disfmarker} uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had {vocalsound} both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the {pause} last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna do next meeting is {disfmarker} is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can {disfmarker} I can dream up text but {pause} this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . So {pause} Um {disfmarker} If w
Turn 401, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 402, A (Grad): This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ?
Turn 403, B (Professor): Um , that would
Turn 404, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 405, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . So , uh , we can {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} So that 's an {disfmarker}
Turn 406, D (PhD): Is this gotta be in the morning ?
Turn 407, B (Professor): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 408, D (PhD): Or {disfmarker} Because you know I {disfmarker} Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . So if it could be before that would be be
Turn 409, B (Professor): No , no but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on {disfmarker}
Turn 410, D (PhD): Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood .
Turn 411, B (Professor): Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting {pause} if I wa something I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her .
Turn 412, D (PhD): I thought you are {disfmarker} OK . Alright . Mm - hmm .
Turn 413, B (Professor): I think I have a pretty good idea
Turn 414, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 415, B (Professor): but {disfmarker} but um {disfmarker} Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that {disfmarker} that discussion with her .
Turn 416, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 417, B (Professor): Um . So .
Turn 418, D (PhD): Um {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} One thing {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in past meetings we had um also a you know various {disfmarker} variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the {disfmarker} on the recognition side
Turn 419, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 420, D (PhD): um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh {disfmarker}
Turn 421, B (Professor): Think so ?
Turn 422, D (PhD): Well , it 's that {disfmarker} It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system .
Turn 423, A (Grad): I 'm interested .
Turn 424, B (Professor): Well , OK , so how many {disfmarker} how many people here would not be interested in uh {disfmarker} in a meeting about recognition ?
Turn 425, C (PhD): Me too .
Turn 426, F (PhD): Jane may not be .
Turn 427, A (Grad): Jane , I think .
Turn 428, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 429, D (PhD): Well I know {disfmarker} Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this {disfmarker}
Turn 430, A (Grad): No . If we talked about it in this meeting .
Turn 431, F (PhD): He 's wondering how much overlap there will be .
Turn 432, B (Professor): Yeah , so you 're su
Turn 433, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 434, B (Professor): So .
Turn 435, D (PhD): So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably .
Turn 436, B (Professor): OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting .
Turn 437, D (PhD): Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , if you wanna put it that way .
Turn 438, F (PhD): Good thing Liz isn't here .
Turn 439, B (Professor): Real {disfmarker}
Turn 440, E (Grad): Watch a ball game ?
Turn 441, B (Professor): Yeah , real {disfmarker} real {disfmarker} real men {vocalsound} " Real men do decoding " or something like that .
Turn 442, F (PhD): Don't listen to this , Liz .
Turn 443, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 444, B (Professor): Uh .
Turn 445, D (PhD): I mean it it 's sort of {disfmarker} I mean when {disfmarker} when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I 'm bored .
Turn 446, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 447, A (Grad): The {disfmarker} Nod off ?
Turn 448, D (PhD): So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to {disfmarker} i to {disfmarker} to be uh {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} I cou you know {disfmarker} this could {disfmarker}
Turn 449, B (Professor): It 's cuz {pause} y you have a {disfmarker} So you need a better developed feminine side .
Turn 450, D (PhD): I 'm
Turn 451, B (Professor): There 's probably gonna be a lot of " bleeps " in this meeting .
Turn 452, D (PhD): not sure I wanna {disfmarker}
Turn 453, A (Grad): Yeah , I would as {comment} I would guess .
Turn 454, B (Professor): Uh . Um .
Turn 455, D (PhD): Yeah and {disfmarker}
Turn 456, B (Professor): I think it must be {pause} uh nearing the end of the week . Um . {vocalsound} Yeah . I {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be .
Turn 457, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 458, B (Professor): I mean the {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} U
Turn 459, D (PhD): And we don't have to do it every week .
Turn 460, F (PhD): Could we {disfmarker}
Turn 461, D (PhD): We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we {disfmarker}
Turn 462, F (PhD): Right , I was {disfmarker} Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?
Turn 463, A (Grad): Or just alternate the focus .
Turn 464, F (PhD): Tha - That 's what I mean .
Turn 465, A (Grad): Yeah , so on even weeks have {pause} basic {pause} on data .
Turn 466, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 467, D (PhD): We could do that , yeah .
Turn 468, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 469, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Personally I 'd {disfmarker} I 'm not in favor of more meetings . Um . {vocalsound} Because , uh .
Turn 470, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 471, A (Grad): I am .
Turn 472, D (PhD): You know .
Turn 473, A (Grad): Oh sor
Turn 474, F (PhD): But I do I don't {disfmarker} I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder .
Turn 475, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 476, A (Grad): Well , except that we keep going for our full time .
Turn 477, F (PhD): So if we did that {disfmarker}
Turn 478, C (PhD): Yep .
Turn 479, F (PhD): Well , cuz we get into these other topics .
Turn 480, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 481, D (PhD): We feel {disfmarker} We feel obligated to collect more data .
Turn 482, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 483, A (Grad): Ugh .
Turn 484, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 485, A (Grad): I don't .
Turn 486, F (PhD): So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting {disfmarker}
Turn 487, A (Grad): Let 's read digits and go .
Turn 488, B (Professor): Why don't we just start with that .
Turn 489, D (PhD): ummh . {comment} ummh . {comment} OK .
Turn 490, B (Professor): And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .
Turn 491, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 492, B (Professor): But I {disfmarker} I think that 's a great idea . Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane {pause} when we get a chance , see what they think and {disfmarker}
Turn 493, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 494, F (PhD): Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls
Turn 495, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 496, F (PhD): and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd {disfmarker} you know , where do we go from here kind of things and {disfmarker} So , it would be good .
Turn 497, B (Professor): Yeah , and you 're {disfmarker} you 're attending {pause} the uh {disfmarker} the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have {disfmarker} you have probably one of the best {disfmarker} you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .
Turn 498, A (Grad): Bridge .
Turn 499, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 500, B (Professor): We are doing recognition in both of them . So .
Turn 501, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 502, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 503, B (Professor): Uh .
Turn 504, A (Grad): OK ?
Turn 505, D (PhD): So um . So {disfmarker} so we could talk a little bit about that now if {disfmarker} if there 's some time .
Turn 506, A (Grad): No , no that would be for next week .
Turn 507, D (PhD): Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh {disfmarker} the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for {disfmarker} for this year 's Hub - five test set .
Turn 508, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 509, D (PhD): And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the {disfmarker} you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .
Turn 510, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 511, F (PhD): For both females and males ?
Turn 512, D (PhD): Yes . Uh , well i there was a little bit of a {disfmarker}
Turn 513, F (PhD): Oh !
Turn 514, D (PhD): i overall . They {disfmarker} They were {disfmarker} The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .
Turn 515, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 516, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 517, D (PhD): I mean definitely not significant .
Turn 518, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 519, D (PhD): And then the really nice thing was that if {disfmarker} if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .
Turn 520, A (Grad): Wow . Just with ROVER ?
Turn 521, D (PhD): So . t With N - best ROVER , which is like our {vocalsound} new and improved version of ROVER .
Turn 522, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 523, D (PhD): Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems {pause} to {pause} mmm , uh {pause} c combine that .
Turn 524, B (Professor): So except {disfmarker} I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .
Turn 525, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 526, B (Professor): OK .
Turn 527, D (PhD): And , the {disfmarker}
Turn 528, F (PhD): But a percent and a half ?
Turn 529, A (Grad): Yeah , it 's pretty {pause} impressive .
Turn 530, F (PhD): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 531, D (PhD): And {disfmarker} And so uh after I told the {disfmarker} my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a {disfmarker} Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . Um , and , you know , why not ?
Turn 532, B (Professor): Sure , why not ?
Turn 533, D (PhD): Uh . {vocalsound} So .
Turn 534, A (Grad): We clearly gotta add a few more features , though .
Turn 535, D (PhD): Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?
Turn 536, A (Grad): No , uh front - end features . You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and {disfmarker}
Turn 537, D (PhD): Oh I mean {disfmarker} Yeah . Well Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} There 's one thing uh {disfmarker} I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end {disfmarker} You know , if you {disfmarker} you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems
Turn 538, F (PhD): Oh .
Turn 539, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 540, D (PhD): and {disfmarker} Um . So . So one {disfmarker} one compromise would be to {disfmarker} only to have the {disfmarker} everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .
Turn 541, B (Professor): Mmm . An
Turn 542, D (PhD): So .
Turn 543, F (PhD): Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh {disfmarker}
Turn 544, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if {disfmarker} You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .
Turn 545, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 546, D (PhD): So . Um {pause} Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .
Turn 547, A (Grad): Cool .
Turn 548, D (PhD): And then we had some results on {pause} digits , uh , with um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} So this was uh really {comment} {disfmarker} really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .
Turn 549, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 550, D (PhD): And so , uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .
Turn 551, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 552, D (PhD): And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .
Turn 553, A (Grad): Right .
Turn 554, B (Professor): Including digits I gather , yeah .
Turn 555, D (PhD): And you c And {disfmarker} Not all of {disfmarker} No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .
Turn 556, B (Professor): A fifth of it is how much ?
Turn 557, D (PhD): The rest is {disfmarker} is read {disfmarker} is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .
Turn 558, B (Professor): Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ?
Turn 559, D (PhD): A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .
Turn 560, B (Professor): Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the {pause} amount of training that there was .
Turn 561, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 562, B (Professor): So .
Turn 563, D (PhD): But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there
Turn 564, B (Professor): Oh yeah
Turn 565, D (PhD): because we 're doing {disfmarker}
Turn 566, B (Professor): w
Turn 567, D (PhD): You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT {disfmarker} {comment} uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,
Turn 568, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 569, D (PhD): which is only what two hours something ?
Turn 570, B (Professor): Right .
Turn 571, A (Grad): I don't know .
Turn 572, D (PhD): So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .
Turn 573, B (Professor): Yeah that was the interesting thing .
Turn 574, D (PhD): That 's e
Turn 575, B (Professor): Because {disfmarker} because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,
Turn 576, D (PhD): That was e Right , right .
Turn 577, B (Professor): but {disfmarker} but uh .
Turn 578, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 579, F (PhD): Well is there even more read speech data around ?
Turn 580, D (PhD): Oh , yeah . So we only {disfmarker} for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone {pause} database .
Turn 581, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 582, D (PhD): Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .
Turn 583, A (Grad): I could also put in {pause} uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech .
Turn 584, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 585, A (Grad): It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .
Turn 586, D (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Right . Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal , {pause} uh , take one example .
Turn 587, A (Grad): Yeah . That 's right .
Turn 588, D (PhD): But um . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the {disfmarker} the digit recognizers to {disfmarker} to use uh something other than TI - digits .
Turn 589, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 590, B (Professor): Well they been using TIMIT .
Turn 591, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 592, B (Professor): That {disfmarker} Uh . {pause} They {disfmarker} they uh {disfmarker} they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests
Turn 593, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 594, B (Professor): and {disfmarker} and uh , um , {disfmarker} and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .
Turn 595, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 596, B (Professor): Uh {disfmarker} But uh {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} So that 's what they 're {disfmarker} they 're using now .
Turn 597, D (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 598, B (Professor): But {disfmarker} but yeah certainly if we , um {disfmarker} If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .
Turn 599, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 600, B (Professor): So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .
Turn 601, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 602, B (Professor): Once we know , then {disfmarker} the trainable parts of it {disfmarker} it 'd be great to run lots of {disfmarker} lots of stuff through .
Turn 603, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Right . Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system and {disfmarker} You wanna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You wanna see where that stands ?
Turn 604, F (PhD): Well , I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 605, D (PhD): 
Turn 606, F (PhD): Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And .
Turn 607, D (PhD): An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's {disfmarker} um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight {disfmarker}
Turn 608, F (PhD): Right . Eight .
Turn 609, D (PhD): forty - eight phones ?
Turn 610, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 611, D (PhD): Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that {disfmarker} that we 've been using so far .
Turn 612, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 613, D (PhD): And that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that will probably help , actually ,
Turn 614, F (PhD): So it 's a little different ?
Turn 615, D (PhD): because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the {disfmarker} as far as just the um , um {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker} You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the {pause} phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .
Turn 616, B (Professor): Sure . Although we {disfmarker} I mean , it 's not that many fewer and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we take a KLT anyway so we could {disfmarker}
Turn 617, D (PhD): Right . Exactly .
Turn 618, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 619, D (PhD): So {disfmarker} so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .
Turn 620, B (Professor): Yeah , and I think {disfmarker} and we sh again check {disfmarker} we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little {disfmarker} uh he didn't lose very much .
Turn 621, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 622, F (PhD): By just taking the top whatever ?
Turn 623, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 624, B (Professor): Yeah yeah .
Turn 625, D (PhD): But then {disfmarker} And then something {disfmarker} Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .
Turn 626, B (Professor): And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .
Turn 627, D (PhD): Exactly .
Turn 628, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 629, D (PhD): Yeah . So that would basically give us a , um , more {disfmarker} hopefully a {disfmarker} a better system
Turn 630, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 631, D (PhD): um because {disfmarker} you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and {disfmarker}
Turn 632, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 633, D (PhD): But he {disfmarker} I think he d he didn't {disfmarker} he probably didn't use all the training data that was available . And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as {disfmarker} as the {disfmarker} as ours is .
Turn 634, B (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} That 's certainly one thing , yeah .
Turn 635, D (PhD): So .
Turn 636, B (Professor): Uh . Yeah .
Turn 637, D (PhD): And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We {disfmarker} we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh {disfmarker} to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a {disfmarker} uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which {disfmarker}
Turn 638, B (Professor): Well the other thing is , dipping {pause} deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before ,
Turn 639, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Mmm .
Turn 640, B (Professor): uh it was {disfmarker} I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .
Turn 641, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 642, B (Professor): When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh {pause} at the time .
Turn 643, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 644, B (Professor): Uh . {pause} And . Later we got away from it because {disfmarker} because once we had decent systems going then it was {disfmarker} it was typically better to use our own systems
Turn 645, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 646, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 647, B (Professor): cuz they were self consistent but {disfmarker} but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . {vocalsound} But that was a {disfmarker} that was a good {disfmarker} good {disfmarker} good way to start .
Turn 648, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 649, B (Professor): And we 're not quite that bad with our {disfmarker} our Switchboard systems but it was {disfmarker} they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,
Turn 650, D (PhD): OK . Yeah .
Turn 651, B (Professor): so {disfmarker}
Turn 652, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 653, F (PhD): W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ?
Turn 654, B (Professor): Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent {pause} error . And uh it was {disfmarker} I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . We never did really fix up the dictionary . Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and {disfmarker} and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .
Turn 655, D (PhD): Yeah . Mmm .
Turn 656, B (Professor): Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation
Turn 657, D (PhD): But that w Even that {disfmarker} that number {disfmarker}
Turn 658, B (Professor): uh , we never did any {disfmarker}
Turn 659, D (PhD): Right . And {disfmarker} And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties .
Turn 660, B (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 661, D (PhD): So , um .
Turn 662, B (Professor): So we were {disfmarker} Yeah . We were probably at least a factor or two off .
Turn 663, D (PhD): That 's yet s Right .
Turn 664, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 665, D (PhD): So it would be {disfmarker} So it would be good t to sort of r re uh {disfmarker}
Turn 666, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 667, D (PhD): just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .
Turn 668, B (Professor): Yeah . But I think {disfmarker} again it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . Because our {disfmarker} our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good .
Turn 669, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 670, B (Professor): He knows .
Turn 671, D (PhD): Right . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ? Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .
Turn 672, B (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 673, D (PhD): So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs {pause} before we go ahead and train up the {disfmarker} uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .
Turn 674, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 675, B (Professor): Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be context independent and so on .
Turn 676, D (PhD): No . Sure . Not {disfmarker}
Turn 677, F (PhD): Should we {disfmarker} Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ?
Turn 678, B (Professor): But .
Turn 679, D (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 680, F (PhD): I mean should {disfmarker} should we even use that ?
Turn 681, D (PhD): Oh {pause} oh that 's a good question .
Turn 682, F (PhD): Or should I just go straight to {disfmarker}
Turn 683, D (PhD): Yeah , we {disfmarker} we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .
Turn 684, A (Grad): Try it . You run it ? Keep {disfmarker} keep both versions ? See which one 's better ?
Turn 685, B (Professor): Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad I mean basically you would then {disfmarker} You proceed with the embedded training .
Turn 686, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 687, B (Professor): It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .
Turn 688, D (PhD): Mm - hmm . Right .
Turn 689, B (Professor): And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .
Turn 690, D (PhD): OK . Alright .
Turn 691, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 692, A (Grad): I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 693, D (PhD): But {disfmarker} But so I {disfmarker}
Turn 694, A (Grad): Sort of given up guessing .
Turn 695, D (PhD): Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got
Turn 696, B (Professor): Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important
Turn 697, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 698, B (Professor): because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .
Turn 699, D (PhD): That are from another {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 700, A (Grad): Although , I mean we 've done it with {disfmarker} When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .
Turn 701, D (PhD): Right .
Turn 702, B (Professor): Uh .
Turn 703, A (Grad): Which I 've never figured out .
Turn 704, B (Professor): Right . But I mean i
Turn 705, A (Grad): I think it 's a bug .
Turn 706, D (PhD): So you {disfmarker} you started training with outputs from a {disfmarker} with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?
Turn 707, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 708, D (PhD): And then {disfmarker} Uh .
Turn 709, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 710, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 711, D (PhD): Hmm . Well , that might probably just {disfmarker} Hmm . That was probably because your initial system {disfmarker} I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's . And you {disfmarker} Um .
Turn 712, B (Professor): Was it ? I don't think it was .
Turn 713, A (Grad): No they were {disfmarker} they were comparable .
Turn 714, D (PhD): It wasn't ?
Turn 715, B (Professor): No .
Turn 716, A (Grad): They were very close .
Turn 717, D (PhD): Really ?
Turn 718, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 719, D (PhD): That 's weird .
Turn 720, B (Professor): Excuse me ?
Turn 721, D (PhD): That 's {disfmarker} That 's weird .
Turn 722, A (Grad): That 's what I said .
Turn 723, B (Professor): Oh !
Turn 724, D (PhD): No I mean it 's weird that it did {disfmarker} I 'm sorry . It 's w It 's weird that it got worse .
Turn 725, F (PhD): That 's ambiguous .
Turn 726, B (Professor): Um . No . Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean {disfmarker} and wi with the numbers {disfmarker} OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .
Turn 727, D (PhD): Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen {disfmarker} We have seen cases where acoustic {disfmarker} retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .
Turn 728, B (Professor): Yeah . It just {disfmarker}
Turn 729, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 730, B (Professor): But I But I would {disfmarker} I would suspect that something that {disfmarker} that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance {disfmarker} I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .
Turn 731, A (Grad): Yep .
Turn 732, B (Professor): I {disfmarker} I would expect that something that had a different feature set would {disfmarker} would uh benefit from {disfmarker}
Turn 733, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 734, F (PhD): What about uh hidden unit size {pause} on this .
Turn 735, B (Professor): Oh , wait a minute , and the other thing uh ,
Turn 736, F (PhD): Oh .
Turn 737, B (Professor): sorry , it was {disfmarker} the other thing is that what was in common {comment} to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .
Turn 738, A (Grad): Right . Ah yeah .
Turn 739, B (Professor): So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference
Turn 740, A (Grad): That 's another big difference .
Turn 741, B (Professor): and uh , one bac at least {disfmarker} Back at {disfmarker}
Turn 742, D (PhD): You mean with soft targets ? Or {disfmarker} ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} What 's the key issue here ?
Turn 743, B (Professor): Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were {disfmarker} were training {pause} posteriors . And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .
Turn 744, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 745, B (Professor): I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker} Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .
Turn 746, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 747, B (Professor): But we don't know .
Turn 748, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 749, B (Professor): You gonna say something ?
Turn 750, F (PhD): Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker} Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?
Turn 751, B (Professor): Uh , how much training data ?
Turn 752, F (PhD): Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .
Turn 753, B (Professor): And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?
Turn 754, F (PhD): That 's why I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .
Turn 755, D (PhD): Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker} Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training , right ? So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .
Turn 756, F (PhD): Gender - dependent , yeah .
Turn 757, D (PhD): Thirty hours per gender .
Turn 758, F (PhD): Thirty hours .
Turn 759, A (Grad): I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .
Turn 760, F (PhD): In the small training set ?
Turn 761, A (Grad): Hello ?
Turn 762, D (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think so . I 'll {disfmarker}
Turn 763, A (Grad): Excuse me ?
Turn 764, D (PhD): It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}
Turn 765, A (Grad): Alright .
Turn 766, D (PhD): You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours something like that .
Turn 767, A (Grad): Wrong number .
Turn 768, F (PhD): They called to tell us that ?
Turn 769, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 770, D (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 771, B (Professor): Um . So . Uh . after run
Turn 772, F (PhD): I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,
Turn 773, B (Professor): Right . So
Turn 774, F (PhD): just {disfmarker}
Turn 775, B (Professor): At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more
Turn 776, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 777, B (Professor): but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .
Turn 778, F (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 779, B (Professor): You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}
Turn 780, F (PhD): And a thousand is too small ?
Turn 781, B (Professor): Oh let me think about it , but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,
Turn 782, F (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 783, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 784, B (Professor): but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .
Turn 785, D (PhD): Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .
Turn 786, A (Grad): But not by a lot .
Turn 787, B (Professor): Not by much .
Turn 788, D (PhD): And then {disfmarker}
Turn 789, B (Professor): Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?
Turn 790, A (Grad): Vast majority is from the input unit .
Turn 791, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 792, D (PhD): OK . Yeah .
Turn 793, B (Professor): Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .
Turn 794, A (Grad): Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .
Turn 795, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 796, D (PhD): Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course .
Turn 797, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 798, D (PhD): Yeah . It 's negligible , OK .
Turn 799, B (Professor): Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .
Turn 800, D (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 801, B (Professor): Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker} How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?
Turn 802, F (PhD): The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .
Turn 803, B (Professor): Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .
Turn 804, D (PhD): Was that gender - dependent or independent ?
Turn 805, F (PhD): Gender - dependent .
Turn 806, B (Professor): Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .
Turn 807, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 808, B (Professor): So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .
Turn 809, A (Grad): It 'll be faster .
Turn 810, B (Professor): So .
Turn 811, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 812, D (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 813, F (PhD): Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .
Turn 814, B (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 815, D (PhD): OK .
Turn 816, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 817, B (Professor): Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}
Turn 818, D (PhD): Right . I actually have to go .
Turn 819, B (Professor): Alright .
Turn 820, D (PhD): So .
Turn 821, B (Professor): Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 822, A (Grad): We 're just waiting for you to leave .
Turn 823, B (Professor): Yes sir .
Turn 824, A (Grad): Anything else ?
Turn 825, B (Professor): Nah .
Turn 826, A (Grad): OK .
Turn 827, B (Professor): Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour .
Turn 828, A (Grad): If {disfmarker}
Turn 829, B (Professor): So .
Turn 830, A (Grad): yeah that 's right .
Turn 831, C (PhD): Yeah .
