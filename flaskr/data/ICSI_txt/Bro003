Turn 1, G (PhD): Test .
Turn 2, E (PhD): Hello .
Turn 3, D (Grad): Channel three .
Turn 4, G (PhD): Test .
Turn 5, A (PhD): Uh - oh .
Turn 6, F (Professor): So you think we 're going now , yes ? OK , good . Alright Going again Uh {disfmarker} So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do {disfmarker} do our digits . Uh transcript one three one one dash one three three zero . {comment} three two three {comment} four seven six five {comment} five three one six two four one {comment} six seven {comment} seven {comment} eight {comment} nine zero nine four zero zero three {comment} zero one five eight {comment} one seven three five three {comment} two six eight zero {comment} three six two four three zero seven {comment} four {comment} five zero six nine four {comment} seven four {comment} eight five seven {comment} nine six one five {comment} O seven eight O two {comment} zero nine six zero four zero zero {comment} one {comment} two {comment} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , you don't actually n need to say the name .
Turn 7, C (Grad): OK , {vocalsound} this is Barry Chen and I am reading transcript
Turn 8, F (Professor): That 'll probably be bleeped out .
Turn 9, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 10, F (Professor): So . That 's if these are anonymized , but {vocalsound} Yeah {disfmarker}
Turn 11, C (Grad): Oh . {comment} OK .
Turn 12, F (Professor): uh {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} not that there 's anything defamatory about uh {disfmarker} eight five seven or {vocalsound} or anything , but
Turn 13, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 14, F (Professor): Uh , anyway . Uh {disfmarker} so here 's what I have for {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was just jotting down things I think th w that we should do today . Uh {disfmarker} This is what I have for an agenda so far Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh {disfmarker} the field trip next week . Uh {disfmarker} a number of us are doing a field trip to uh Uh {disfmarker} OGI And uh {disfmarker} mostly uh First though about the logistics for it . Then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know , might accomplish . Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 15, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 16, F (Professor): Uh , in and {pause} kind of go around {disfmarker} see what people have been doing {disfmarker} talk about that , {pause} a r progress report . Um , Essentially . Um {disfmarker} And then uh {disfmarker} Another topic I had was that uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} Dave here had uh said uh " Give me something to do . " And I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker} I have uh {disfmarker} failed so far in doing that . And so maybe we can discuss that a little bit . If we find some holes in some things that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} someone could use some help with , he 's {disfmarker} he 's volunteering to help .
Turn 17, A (PhD): I 've got to move a bunch of furniture .
Turn 18, F (Professor): OK , always count on a {vocalsound} serious comment from that corner . So , um , uh , and uh , then uh , talk a little bit about {disfmarker} about disks and resource {disfmarker} resource issues that {disfmarker} that 's starting to get worked out . And then , anything else anybody has that isn't in that list ? Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 19, D (Grad): I was just wondering , does this mean the battery 's dying and I should change it ?
Turn 20, F (Professor): Uh I think that means the battery 's O K . {disfmarker}
Turn 21, A (PhD): Let me see .
Turn 22, F (Professor): d {disfmarker} do you
Turn 23, D (Grad): Oh OK , so th
Turn 24, A (PhD): Yeah , that 's good . You 're alright ?
Turn 25, D (Grad): Cuz it 's full .
Turn 26, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 27, D (Grad): Alright .
Turn 28, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . It looks full of electrons . OK . Plenty of electrons left there . OK , so , um , uh . OK , so , uh , I wanted to start this with this mundane thing . Um {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning .
Turn 29, C (Grad): Oh , yeah , that 's right .
Turn 30, F (Professor): Um . Uh {vocalsound} this is uh {disfmarker} The reason I did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a {disfmarker} of a visit . Uh {disfmarker} So um the issue is how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how would we ever accomplish that ? Uh {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what part of town do you live in ?
Turn 31, C (Grad): Um , I live in , um , the corner of campus . The , um , southeast corner .
Turn 32, F (Professor): OK . OK , so would it be easier {disfmarker} those of you who are not , you know , used to this area , it can be very tricky to get to the airport at {disfmarker} at uh , you know , six thirty . Um . So . Would it be easier for you if you came here and I drove you ? Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , OK .
Turn 33, G (PhD): Yeah , perhaps , yeah .
Turn 34, C (Grad): Yeah . Sure .
Turn 35, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 36, F (Professor): OK , so if {disfmarker} if everybody can get here at six .
Turn 37, E (PhD): At six .
Turn 38, F (Professor): Yeah , I 'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time .
Turn 39, C (Grad): Six , OK .
Turn 40, F (Professor): Yeah , so . Oh boy . Anyway , so .
Turn 41, A (PhD): Will that {pause} be enough time ?
Turn 42, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front . And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time . It 'll take {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it won't be bad traffic that time of day and {disfmarker} and uh
Turn 43, A (PhD): I guess once you get past the bridge {pause} that that would be the worst .
Turn 44, B (PhD): Yeah , Oakland .
Turn 45, F (Professor): Going to Oakland .
Turn 46, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 47, C (Grad): Oakland .
Turn 48, A (PhD): Once you get past the turnoff to the {pause} Bay Bridge .
Turn 49, F (Professor): Bridge oh , the turnoff to the bridge
Turn 50, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 51, F (Professor): Won't even do that .
Turn 52, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 53, F (Professor): I mean , just go down Martin Luther King .
Turn 54, A (PhD): Yeah . OK . Mm - hmm .
Turn 55, F (Professor): And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty ,
Turn 56, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 57, F (Professor): and it 's {disfmarker} it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there .
Turn 58, A (PhD): Oh , I {disfmarker}
Turn 59, F (Professor): So that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane {disfmarker} it 'll just {disfmarker} yeah . So Great , OK so that 'll It 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's still not going to be really easy but {disfmarker} well Particularly for {disfmarker} for uh {disfmarker} for Barry and me , we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not staying overnight so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} a pad of paper and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , and , uh you , two have to bring a little bit
Turn 60, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 61, F (Professor): but uh {disfmarker} you know , don't {disfmarker} don't bring a footlocker and we 'll be OK So .
Turn 62, C (Grad): s So just {disfmarker}
Turn 63, F (Professor): W you 're staying overnight . I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase , yeah .
Turn 64, G (PhD): Oh yeah . Yeah .
Turn 65, F (Professor): That 's sort of {pause} {vocalsound} one night . So . Anyway . OK .
Turn 66, C (Grad): So , s six AM , in front .
Turn 67, F (Professor): Six AM in front .
Turn 68, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 69, F (Professor): Uh , I 'll be here . Uh {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll give you my phone number , If I 'm not here for a few m after a few minutes then
Turn 70, C (Grad): Wake you up .
Turn 71, F (Professor): Nah , I 'll be fine . I just , uh {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than I usually do . Not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not a lot ,
Turn 72, C (Grad): OK . Wednesday .
Turn 73, F (Professor): so OK , that was the real real important stuff . Um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh {disfmarker} until we talk about wh what 's been going on . So , uh , what 's been going on ? Why don't we start {disfmarker} start over here .
Turn 74, G (PhD): Um . {vocalsound} Well , preparation of the French test data actually .
Turn 75, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 76, G (PhD): So , {vocalsound} it means that um , well , it is , uh , a digit French database of microphone speech , downsampled to eight kilohertz and I 've added noise to one part , with the {disfmarker} actually the Aurora - two noises . And , @ @ so this is a training part . And then {pause} the remaining part , I use for testing and {disfmarker} with other kind of noises . So we can {disfmarker} So this is almost ready . I 'm preparing the {disfmarker} the HTK baseline for this task . And , yeah .
Turn 77, F (Professor): OK Uh , So the HTK base lines {disfmarker} so this is using mel cepstra and so on , or {disfmarker} ? Yeah . OK .
Turn 78, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 79, F (Professor): And again , I guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh {disfmarker} then given this {disfmarker} What 's the plan again ?
Turn 80, G (PhD): The plan with {pause} these data ?
Turn 81, F (Professor): With {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Does i Just remind me of what {disfmarker} what you were going to do with the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} y You just described what you 've been doing . So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing .
Turn 82, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 83, F (Professor): Oh , this is {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .
Turn 84, G (PhD): Uh , yeah .
Turn 85, C (Grad): Tell him about the cube .
Turn 86, G (PhD): Well . The cube ? I should tell him about the cube ?
Turn 87, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 88, F (Professor): Oh ! Cube . Yeah .
Turn 89, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 90, E (PhD): Fill in the cube .
Turn 91, G (PhD): Uh we {disfmarker} actually we want to , mmm , Uh , {vocalsound} uh , analyze three dimensions , the feature dimension , the {pause} training data dimension , and the test data dimension . Um . Well , what we want to do is first we have number for each {pause} uh task . So we have the um , TI - digit task , the Italian task , the French task {pause} and the Finnish task .
Turn 92, F (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 93, G (PhD): So we have numbers with {pause} uh {disfmarker} systems {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} I mean neural networks trained on the task data . And then to have systems with neural networks trained on , {vocalsound} uh , data from the same language , if possible , with , well , using a more generic database , which is phonetically {disfmarker} phonetically balanced , and . Um .
Turn 94, F (Professor): So - so we had talked {disfmarker} I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ?
Turn 95, G (PhD): Yeah . So .
Turn 96, F (Professor): Is that a possibility for that ?
Turn 97, G (PhD): Ye - uh {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a CallHome and a CallFriend also , The CallFriend is for language ind identification . Well , anyway , these corpus are all telephone speech . So , um . {vocalsound} This could be a {disfmarker} {pause} a problem for {disfmarker} Why ? Because uh , uh , the {disfmarker} the SpeechDat databases are not telephone speech . They are downsampled to eight kilohertz but {disfmarker} but they are not {vocalsound} uh with telephone bandwidth .
Turn 98, F (Professor): Yeah . That 's really funny isn't it ? I mean cuz th this whole thing is for {pause} developing new standards for the telephone .
Turn 99, C (Grad): Telephone .
Turn 100, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 101, G (PhD): Yeah , but the {disfmarker} the idea is to compute the feature before {pause} the {disfmarker} before sending them to the {disfmarker} Well , {pause} you don't {disfmarker} do not send speech , you send features , computed on th the {disfmarker} {pause} the device ,
Turn 102, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Yeah , I know , but the reason {disfmarker}
Turn 103, G (PhD): or {disfmarker} Well .
Turn 104, F (Professor): Oh I see , so your point is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions .
Turn 105, G (PhD): So you {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 106, A (PhD): Did you {pause} happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ?
Turn 107, F (Professor): Yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what I meant .
Turn 108, G (PhD): Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 109, F (Professor): I said {disfmarker} @ @ , there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's an OGI language ID , not the {disfmarker} not the , uh {disfmarker} the CallFriend is a {disfmarker} is a , uh , LDC w thing , right ?
Turn 110, G (PhD): Yea - Yeah , there are also two other databases . One they call the multi - language database , and another one is a twenty - two language , something like that . But it 's also telephone speech .
Turn 111, A (PhD): Oh , they are ? OK .
Turn 112, G (PhD): Uh . Well , nnn .
Turn 113, F (Professor): But I 'm not sure {disfmarker}
Turn 114, G (PhD): So {disfmarker}
Turn 115, F (Professor): I mean , we ' r e e The bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue right ? Because e e this is downsampled and {disfmarker} and filtered , right ? So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . And there are so many other differences between these different databases . I mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , and some of it 's {disfmarker} I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's many different acoustic differences . So I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the {disfmarker} in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's {disfmarker} completely rules it out
Turn 116, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 117, F (Professor): if our {disfmarker} if we {disfmarker} if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gonna be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will .
Turn 118, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 119, F (Professor): Uh , i i I {disfmarker} I guess the question is how important is it to {disfmarker} for us to get multiple languages uh , in there .
Turn 120, G (PhD): Yeah , but {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah . Well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we {disfmarker} we already have uh {disfmarker} English , Spanish and French uh , with microphone speech . 
Turn 121, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 122, G (PhD): So .
Turn 123, F (Professor): So that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?
Turn 124, G (PhD): Well . Yeah , for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases .
Turn 125, F (Professor): And for the difference in phonetic context {pause} that you {disfmarker} ? Provide that .
Turn 126, G (PhD): Well , this {disfmarker} Uh , actually , these three databases are um generic databases .
Turn 127, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 128, G (PhD): So w f for {disfmarker} for uh Italian , which is close to Spanish , French and , i i uh , TI - digits we have both uh , digits {pause} training data and also {pause} more general training data . So . Mmm .
Turn 129, F (Professor): Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is microphone data for {disfmarker} for English .
Turn 130, G (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , perhaps {disfmarker} yeah , there is also TIMIT .
Turn 131, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 132, G (PhD): We could use TIMIT .
Turn 133, F (Professor): Right . Yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around . OK , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube . Yes .
Turn 134, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 135, E (PhD): To fill in the cube .
Turn 136, F (Professor): To fill i fill it in , yeah . OK .
Turn 137, G (PhD): Yeah , and perhaps , um {disfmarker} {pause} We were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . Well , w w we {disfmarker} perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . I mean , uh , training {disfmarker} training a net on a language and testing a for another language .
Turn 138, F (Professor): Uh - huh . But that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 139, G (PhD): Mmm . Perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages . But , uh , with a general database {disfmarker} general databases . u So that th Well , the {disfmarker} the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained o on that language , or a generic net ,
Turn 140, F (Professor): Uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean " using the net " .
Turn 141, G (PhD): but not trained on a {disfmarker}
Turn 142, F (Professor): So , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features {pause} that we 're talking about {pause} you can't do that .
Turn 143, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 144, F (Professor): Because {disfmarker} because the {disfmarker} what they 're asking for is {disfmarker} is a feature set . Right ? And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by {disfmarker} by doing this training . But if we say , " No , you have to have a different feature set for each language , " I think this is ver gonna be very bad .
Turn 145, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 146, C (Grad): Oh .
Turn 147, G (PhD): You think so .
Turn 148, C (Grad): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 149, E (PhD): Oh .
Turn 150, F (Professor): So {disfmarker} Oh yeah .
Turn 151, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 152, F (Professor): Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ {comment} well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra .
Turn 153, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 154, F (Professor): So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand , we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . " OK ? And so {vocalsound} we give them these gobbledy - gook features but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language .
Turn 155, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 156, F (Professor): Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call , and you know , I mean so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker} how do you know what language it is ? Somebody picks up the phone . So thi this is their image . Someone picks up the phone , right ?
Turn 157, G (PhD): Well , I {comment} chh {disfmarker}
Turn 158, F (Professor): And {disfmarker} and he {disfmarker} he picks up the ph
Turn 159, G (PhD): Yeah , but the {disfmarker} the application is {disfmarker} there is a target language for the application .
Turn 160, F (Professor): Yeah . y y y
Turn 161, G (PhD): So , if a {disfmarker}
Turn 162, F (Professor): Well . But , no but , y you {disfmarker} you pick up the phone ,
Turn 163, G (PhD): Well .
Turn 164, F (Professor): you talk on the phone ,
Turn 165, G (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 166, F (Professor): and it sends features out . OK , so the phone doesn't know what a {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what your language is .
Turn 167, G (PhD): Yeah , if {disfmarker} Yeah . If it 's th in the phone , but {disfmarker}
Turn 168, F (Professor): But that 's the image that they have .
Turn 169, G (PhD): well , it {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that could be th at the server 's side ,
Turn 170, F (Professor): It could be ,
Turn 171, G (PhD): and , well . Mmm , yeah .
Turn 172, F (Professor): but that 's the image they have , right ? So that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and {disfmarker} and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the {disfmarker} uh , on the phone . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's what we 're involved in . We might {disfmarker} might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's what they 're asking for . So {disfmarker} so I think that {disfmarker} th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . And they may very well be right , but I {disfmarker} I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that the rest doesn't matter . Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh {disfmarker} which I {disfmarker} I guess they 're starting to look at up there , {comment} training to something more like articulatory features . Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages .
Turn 173, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 174, F (Professor): Uh , but {disfmarker} Yeah , so I don't th I know {disfmarker} unfortunately I don't {disfmarker} I see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , I think , but I don't think we can ignore it .
Turn 175, G (PhD): So we {disfmarker} we really have to do test with a real cross - language . I mean , tr for instance training on English and testing on Italian , or {disfmarker} Or we can train {disfmarker} or else , uh , can we train a net on , uh , a range of languages and {disfmarker} which can include the test {disfmarker} the test @ @ the target language ,
Turn 176, C (Grad): Test on an unseen .
Turn 177, G (PhD): or {disfmarker}
Turn 178, F (Professor): Yeah , so , um , there 's {disfmarker} there 's , uh {disfmarker} This is complex . So , ultimately , uh , as I was saying , I think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . Now , can you include , uh , the {disfmarker} the target language ?
Turn 179, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 180, F (Professor): Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to because then you can say when {disfmarker} because surely someone is going to say at some point , " OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish .
Turn 181, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 182, F (Professor): Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? " you know ? Um , and {disfmarker} Uh , however , you aren't {disfmarker} it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation . So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that {disfmarker} that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we {disfmarker} we note it and say , " Look , we did do this " .
Turn 183, G (PhD): Mmm ?
Turn 184, A (PhD): And so , ideally , what you 'd wanna do is you 'd wanna run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages .
Turn 185, F (Professor): Uh . Yeah .
Turn 186, G (PhD): Yeah , perhaps . Yeah .
Turn 187, A (PhD): And that way you can say , " Well , " you know , " we 're gonna build it for what we think are {pause} the most common ones " ,
Turn 188, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 189, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 190, A (PhD): but if that {disfmarker} somebody uses it with a different language , you know , " here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . "
Turn 191, F (Professor): Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like there are {disfmarker} I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't .
Turn 192, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 193, F (Professor): There 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , there 's fifty or something , you know ? So , uh , an and they aren't {disfmarker} you know , with the exception of Finnish , which I guess it 's pretty different from most {disfmarker} most things . uh , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} most of them are like at least some of the others . And so , our guess that Spanish is like Italian , and {disfmarker} and so on . I guess Finnish is a {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is a little bit like Hungarian , supposedly , right ?
Turn 194, A (PhD): I don't know anything about Finnish .
Turn 195, F (Professor): Or is {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the {disfmarker} one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family .
Turn 196, A (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 197, F (Professor): But they 're just these , you know , uh {disfmarker} countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have {disfmarker} I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their {disfmarker}
Turn 198, A (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 199, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 200, G (PhD): The {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 201, C (Grad): Oh , my turn .
Turn 202, F (Professor): Your turn .
Turn 203, C (Grad): Oh , OK . Um , Let 's see , I {disfmarker} I spent the last week , uh , looking over Stephane 's shoulder . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and understanding some of the data . I re - installed , um , um , HTK , the free version , so , um , everybody 's now using three point O , which is the same version that , uh , OGI is using .
Turn 204, F (Professor): Oh , good .
Turn 205, C (Grad): Yeah . So , without {disfmarker} without any licensing big deals , or anything like that . And , um , so we 've been talking about this {disfmarker} this , uh , cube thing , and it 's beginning more and more looking like the , uh , the Borge cube thing . It 's really gargantuan . Um , but I I 'm {disfmarker} Am I {disfmarker}
Turn 206, F (Professor): So are {disfmarker} are you going to be assimilated ?
Turn 207, A (PhD): Resistance is futile .
Turn 208, C (Grad): Exactly . Um , yeah , so I I 've been looking at , uh , uh , TIMIT stuff . Um , the {disfmarker} the stuff that we 've been working on with TIMIT , trying to get a , um {disfmarker} a labels file so we can , uh , train up a {disfmarker} train up a net on TIMIT and test , um , the difference between this net trained on TIMIT and a net trained on digits alone . Um , and seeing if {disfmarker} if it hurts or helps .
Turn 209, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 210, C (Grad): Anyway .
Turn 211, F (Professor): And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ?
Turn 212, C (Grad): Yeah , yeah . Um . Mm - hmm .
Turn 213, F (Professor): And {disfmarker} and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing ,
Turn 214, C (Grad): Well , the inputs are one dimension of the cube ,
Turn 215, F (Professor): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 216, C (Grad): which , um , we 've talked about it being , uh , PLP , um , M F C Cs , um , J - JRASTA , JRASTA - LDA {disfmarker}
Turn 217, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 218, F (Professor): Yeah , but your initial things you 're making one choice there ,
Turn 219, C (Grad): Yeah ,
Turn 220, F (Professor): right ?
Turn 221, C (Grad): right .
Turn 222, F (Professor): Which is PLP , or something ?
Turn 223, C (Grad): Um , I {disfmarker} I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't decided on {disfmarker} on the initial thing .
Turn 224, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 225, C (Grad): Probably {disfmarker} probably something like PLP . Yeah .
Turn 226, G (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 227, F (Professor): Yeah . Um , so {disfmarker} so you take PLP and you {disfmarker} you , uh , do it {disfmarker} uh , you {disfmarker} you , uh , use HTK with it with the transformed features using a neural net that 's trained . And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT .
Turn 228, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 229, F (Professor): And that 's the {disfmarker} and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} which might be foreign language .
Turn 230, C (Grad): Right . Right .
Turn 231, F (Professor): I see . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I get in the picture about the cube .
Turn 232, C (Grad): Yeah . Maybe {disfmarker}
Turn 233, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 234, C (Grad): OK . Uh - huh .
Turn 235, F (Professor): OK . Um , I mean , those listening to this will not have a picture either , so , um , I guess I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not any worse off . But but at some point {disfmarker} somebody should just show me the cube . It sounds s I {disfmarker} I get {disfmarker} I think I get the general idea of it ,
Turn 236, C (Grad): Yeah , yeah ,
Turn 237, F (Professor): yeah .
Turn 238, A (PhD): So , when you said that you were getting the labels for TIMIT , {comment} um , are y what do you mean by that ?
Turn 239, C (Grad): b May Mm - hmm . Oh , I 'm just {disfmarker} I 'm just , uh , transforming them from the , um , the standard TIMIT transcriptions into {disfmarker} into a nice long huge P - file to do training .
Turn 240, A (PhD): Mmm . Were the digits , um , hand - labeled for phones ?
Turn 241, C (Grad): Um , the {disfmarker} the digits {disfmarker}
Turn 242, A (PhD): Or were they {disfmarker} those labels automatically derived ?
Turn 243, C (Grad): Oh yeah , those were {disfmarker} those were automatically derived by {disfmarker} by Dan using , um , embedded {disfmarker} embedded training and alignment .
Turn 244, A (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 245, F (Professor): Ah , but which Dan ?
Turn 246, C (Grad): Uh , Ellis . Right ?
Turn 247, F (Professor): OK . OK .
Turn 248, C (Grad): Yeah . So .
Turn 249, A (PhD): I was just wondering because that test you 're t
Turn 250, C (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 251, A (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific {pause} speech .
Turn 252, C (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 253, F (Professor): Well , especially when you go over the different languages again , because you 'd {disfmarker} the different languages have different words for the different digits ,
Turn 254, A (PhD): Mm - hmm . And I was {disfmarker}
Turn 255, F (Professor): so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 256, A (PhD): yeah , so I was just wondering if the fact that TIMIT {disfmarker} you 're using the hand - labeled stuff from TIMIT might be {disfmarker} confuse the results that you get .
Turn 257, F (Professor): I {disfmarker} I think it would , but {disfmarker} but on the other hand it might be better .
Turn 258, A (PhD): Right , but if it 's better , it may be better because {pause} it was hand - labeled .
Turn 259, F (Professor): Oh yeah , but still @ @ probably use it .
Turn 260, A (PhD): Yeah . OK .
Turn 261, F (Professor): I mean , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm sounding cavalier , but I mean , I think the point is you have , uh , a bunch of labels and {disfmarker} and they 're han hand uh {disfmarker} hand - marked . Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked . It was automatically first , and then hand {disfmarker} hand - corrected .
Turn 262, A (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 263, F (Professor): But {disfmarker} but , um , uh , it {disfmarker} it , um , it might be a better source . So , i it 's {disfmarker} you 're right . It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , " Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? "
Turn 264, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 265, F (Professor): uh . And that 's something you could ask , but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system ,
Turn 266, A (PhD): Yeah . Right .
Turn 267, F (Professor): then it 's probably {disfmarker}
Turn 268, A (PhD): What about the differences in the phone sets ?
Turn 269, C (Grad): Uh , between languages ?
Turn 270, A (PhD): No , between TIMIT and the {disfmarker} the digits .
Turn 271, C (Grad): Oh , um , right . Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to {disfmarker} to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six .
Turn 272, E (PhD): Sixty - one .
Turn 273, A (PhD): Oh , OK . I see .
Turn 274, C (Grad): And then the digits phonemes , um , there 's about twenty twenty - two or twenty - four of them ? Is that right ?
Turn 275, A (PhD): Out of that fifty - six ?
Turn 276, G (PhD): Yep .
Turn 277, C (Grad): Out of that fifty - six .
Turn 278, A (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 279, C (Grad): Yeah . So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's definitely broader , yeah .
Turn 280, G (PhD): But , actually , the issue of phoneti phon uh phone phoneme mappings will arise when we will do severa use several languages
Turn 281, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 282, G (PhD): because you {disfmarker} Well , some phonemes are not , uh , in every languages , and {disfmarker} So we plan to develop a subset of the phonemes , uh , that includes , uh , all the phonemes of our training languages ,
Turn 283, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 284, G (PhD): and use a network with kind of one hundred outputs or something like that .
Turn 285, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . You mean a superset , sort of .
Turn 286, G (PhD): Uh , yeah ,
Turn 287, F (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Turn 288, G (PhD): superset ,
Turn 289, E (PhD): Yeah . I th I looks the SAMPA SAMPA phone .
Turn 290, G (PhD): yeah .
Turn 291, E (PhD): SAMPA phone ? For English {disfmarker} uh American English , and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the language who have more phone are the English .
Turn 292, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 293, A (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 294, E (PhD): Of the {disfmarker} these language . But n for example , in Spain , the Spanish have several phone that d doesn't appear in the E English and we thought to complete . But for that , it needs {disfmarker} we must r h do a lot of work {vocalsound} because we need to generate new tran transcription for the database that we have .
Turn 295, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 296, B (PhD): Other than the language , is there a reason not to use the TIMIT phone set ? Cuz it 's larger ? As opposed to the ICSI {pause} phone set ?
Turn 297, C (Grad): Oh , you mean why map the sixty - one to the fifty - six ?
Turn 298, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 299, C (Grad): I don't know . I have {disfmarker}
Turn 300, F (Professor): Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it {disfmarker} o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that . But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there .
Turn 301, A (PhD): Yeah , and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning , when really they 're {pause} both silence .
Turn 302, B (PhD): Oh .
Turn 303, A (PhD): I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six .
Turn 304, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 305, F (Professor): Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system . You know , you 're really asking this net to learn .
Turn 306, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 307, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 308, F (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} it 's kind of hard .
Turn 309, A (PhD): There 's not much difference , really . And {pause} the ones that are gone , I think are {disfmarker} I think there was {disfmarker} they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop , which was basically a short period of silence ,
Turn 310, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 311, A (PhD): and so .
Turn 312, B (PhD): Well , we have that now , too , right ?
Turn 313, A (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 314, B (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 315, A (PhD): So .
Turn 316, F (Professor): i It 's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like {disfmarker} like , say thirty - nine , phone symbols , right ? Uh , and then they get the variety by {disfmarker} by bringing in the context , the phonetic context . Uh . So we actually have an unusually large number in {disfmarker} in what we tend to use here . Um . So , a a actually {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} now you 've got me sort of intrigued . What {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} Can you describe what {disfmarker} what 's on the cube ?
Turn 317, C (Grad): Yeah , w I th I think that 's a good idea
Turn 318, F (Professor): I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 319, C (Grad): to {disfmarker} to talk about the whole cube
Turn 320, F (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 321, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 322, C (Grad): and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on .
Turn 323, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 324, C (Grad): Um , OK . Uh , do you wanna do it ?
Turn 325, F (Professor): OK , so even {disfmarker} even though the meeting recorder doesn't {disfmarker} doesn't , uh {disfmarker} and since you 're not running a video camera we won't get this , but if you use a board it 'll help us anyway .
Turn 326, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 327, F (Professor): Uh , point out one of the limitations of this {vocalsound} medium ,
Turn 328, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 329, F (Professor): but you 've got the wireless on ,
Turn 330, C (Grad): Yeah , I have the wireless .
Turn 331, F (Professor): right ? Yeah , so you can walk around .
Turn 332, C (Grad): OK . Can y can you walk around too ? No . OK , well , um ,
Turn 333, F (Professor): Uh , he can't , actually , but {disfmarker}
Turn 334, C (Grad): s basically , the {disfmarker} the cube will have three dimensions .
Turn 335, F (Professor): He 's tethered .
Turn 336, C (Grad): The first dimension is the {disfmarker} the features that we 're going to use . And the second dimension , um , is the training corpus . And that 's the training on the discriminant neural net . Um and the last dimension happens to be {disfmarker}
Turn 337, F (Professor): Yeah and again {disfmarker} Yeah . So the {disfmarker} the training for HTK is always {disfmarker} that 's always set up for the individual test , right ? That there 's some training data and some test data . So that 's different than this .
Turn 338, C (Grad): Right , right . This is {disfmarker} this is for {disfmarker} for ANN only . And , yeah , the training for the HTK models is always , uh , fixed for whatever language you 're testing on .
Turn 339, F (Professor): Right .
Turn 340, C (Grad): And then , there 's the testing corpus . So , then I think it 's probably instructive to go and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and show you the features that we were talking about . Um , so , let 's see . Help me out with {disfmarker}
Turn 341, G (PhD): PLP .
Turn 342, C (Grad): With what ?
Turn 343, G (PhD): PLP .
Turn 344, C (Grad): PLP ? OK .
Turn 345, G (PhD): MSG .
Turn 346, C (Grad): MSG .
Turn 347, G (PhD): Uh , JRASTA .
Turn 348, C (Grad): JRASTA .
Turn 349, G (PhD): And JRASTA - LDA .
Turn 350, C (Grad): JRASTA - LDA .
Turn 351, G (PhD): Um , multi - band .
Turn 352, C (Grad): Multi - band .
Turn 353, G (PhD): So there would be multi - band before , um {disfmarker} before our network , I mean .
Turn 354, C (Grad): Yeah , just the multi - band features , right ?
Turn 355, G (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 356, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 357, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 358, F (Professor): Uh - huh . Ah . Ah .
Turn 359, G (PhD): So , something like , uh , s TCT within bands and {disfmarker} Well . And then multi - band after networks . Meaning that we would have , uh , neural networks , uh , discriminant neural networks for each band . Uh , yeah . And using the {disfmarker} the outputs of these networks or the linear outputs or something like that . Uh , yeah .
Turn 360, A (PhD): What about mel cepstrum ? Or is that {disfmarker}
Turn 361, C (Grad): Oh , um {disfmarker}
Turn 362, A (PhD): you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ?
Turn 363, E (PhD): Yeah databases .
Turn 364, F (Professor): Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra ,
Turn 365, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 366, F (Professor): right ?
Turn 367, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 368, F (Professor): So .
Turn 369, G (PhD): But , uh , well , not for the {disfmarker} the ANN . I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 370, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 371, G (PhD): So , yeah , we could {disfmarker} we could add {pause} MFCC also .
Turn 372, C (Grad): We could add {disfmarker}
Turn 373, F (Professor): Probably should . I mean at least {disfmarker} at least conceptually , you know , it doesn't meant you actually have to do it ,
Turn 374, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 375, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 376, F (Professor): but conceptually it makes sense as a {disfmarker} as a base line .
Turn 377, A (PhD): It 'd be an interesting test just to have {disfmarker} just to do MFCC with the neural net
Turn 378, E (PhD): Without the {disfmarker}
Turn 379, A (PhD): and everything else the same .
Turn 380, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 381, A (PhD): Compare that with just M - MFCC without the {disfmarker} the net .
Turn 382, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 383, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 384, C (Grad): I think {disfmarker} I think Dan did some of that .
Turn 385, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 386, C (Grad): Um , in his previous Aurora experiments . And with the net it 's {disfmarker} it 's wonderful . Without the net it 's just baseline .
Turn 387, F (Professor): Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too . D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually .
Turn 388, C (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 389, F (Professor): Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on . OK ?
Turn 390, C (Grad): OK . Um , for the training corpus {disfmarker} corpus , um , we have , um , the {disfmarker} the d {pause} digits {nonvocalsound} from the various languages . Um , English Spanish um , French What else do we have ?
Turn 391, G (PhD): And the {pause} Finnish .
Turn 392, C (Grad): Finnish .
Turn 393, A (PhD): Where did th where did that come from ?
Turn 394, E (PhD): And Italian .
Turn 395, A (PhD): Digits ?
Turn 396, E (PhD): Uh , no , Italian no . Italian no .
Turn 397, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 398, C (Grad): Oh . Italian .
Turn 399, E (PhD): I Italian yes . Italian ?
Turn 400, F (Professor): Italian .
Turn 401, A (PhD): Is that {disfmarker} Was that distributed with Aurora , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 402, C (Grad): One L or two L 's ?
Turn 403, A (PhD): Where did that {disfmarker} ?
Turn 404, F (Professor): The newer one .
Turn 405, G (PhD): So English , uh , Finnish and Italian are Aurora .
Turn 406, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 407, G (PhD): And Spanish and French is something that we can use in addition to Aurora . Uh , well .
Turn 408, F (Professor): Yeah , so Carmen brought the Spanish , and Stephane brought the French .
Turn 409, C (Grad): OK . And , um , oh yeah , and {disfmarker}
Turn 410, F (Professor): Is it French French or Belgian French ? There 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 411, G (PhD): It 's , uh , French French .
Turn 412, C (Grad): French French .
Turn 413, E (PhD): Like Mexican Spain and Spain .
Turn 414, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 415, B (PhD): Or Swiss .
Turn 416, E (PhD): I think that is more important ,
Turn 417, B (PhD): Swiss - German .
Turn 418, E (PhD): Mexican Spain . Because more people {disfmarker}
Turn 419, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , probably so .
Turn 420, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 421, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is {disfmarker} i is absolutely pure French , has nothing to do with {disfmarker} but he says those {disfmarker} those {disfmarker} those Parisians talk funny .
Turn 422, G (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah . They have an accent .
Turn 423, F (Professor): Yeah they {disfmarker} they do , yeah . Yeah . {pause} But then he likes Belgian fries too , so . OK .
Turn 424, C (Grad): And then we have , uh , um , broader {disfmarker} broader corpus , um , like TIMIT . TIMIT so far ,
Turn 425, E (PhD): And Spanish too .
Turn 426, C (Grad): right ? Spanish {disfmarker} Oh , Spanish stories ?
Turn 427, E (PhD): Albayzin is the name .
Turn 428, A (PhD): What about TI - digits ?
Turn 429, C (Grad): Um , TI - digits {disfmarker} uh all these Aurora f d data p data is from {disfmarker} is derived from TI - digits .
Turn 430, A (PhD): Uh - huh . Oh . Oh OK .
Turn 431, C (Grad): Um , basically , they {disfmarker} they corrupted it with , uh , different kinds of noises at different SNR levels .
Turn 432, A (PhD): Ah . I see .
Turn 433, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 434, F (Professor): y And I think Stephane was saying there 's {disfmarker} there 's some broader s material in the French also ?
Turn 435, G (PhD): Yeah , we cou we could use {disfmarker}
Turn 436, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 437, G (PhD): Yeah . The French data .
Turn 438, E (PhD): Spanish stories ?
Turn 439, C (Grad): No .
Turn 440, E (PhD): No .
Turn 441, C (Grad): Sp - Not Spanish stories ?
Turn 442, E (PhD): No . No . Albayz
Turn 443, F (Professor): Spanish {disfmarker}
Turn 444, C (Grad): Spanish something .
Turn 445, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 446, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 447, B (PhD): Did the Aurora people actually corrupt it themselves , or just specify the signal and the signal - t
Turn 448, C (Grad): They {disfmarker} they corrupted it , um , themselves ,
Turn 449, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 450, C (Grad): but they also included the {disfmarker} the noise files for us , right ? Or {disfmarker}
Turn 451, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 452, C (Grad): so we can go ahead and corrupt other things .
Turn 453, F (Professor): I 'm just curious , Carmen {disfmarker} I mean , I couldn't tell if you were joking or {disfmarker} i Is it {disfmarker} is it Mexican Spanish ,
Turn 454, E (PhD): No no no no .
Turn 455, F (Professor): or is it {disfmarker}
Turn 456, E (PhD): No no no no .
Turn 457, F (Professor): Oh , no , no . It 's {disfmarker} it 's Spanish from Spain , Spanish .
Turn 458, E (PhD): Spanish from Spain .
Turn 459, F (Professor): Yeah , OK .
Turn 460, C (Grad): From Spain .
Turn 461, F (Professor): Alright . Spanish from Spain . Yeah , we 're really covered there now . OK .
Turn 462, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 463, F (Professor): And the French from France .
Turn 464, G (PhD): Yeah , the {disfmarker} No , the French is f yeah , from , uh , Paris ,
Turn 465, C (Grad): Oh , from Paris , OK .
Turn 466, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 467, C (Grad): And TIMIT 's from {pause} lots of different places .
Turn 468, G (PhD): OK .
Turn 469, F (Professor): From TI . From {disfmarker} i It 's from Texas . So may maybe it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 470, B (PhD): From the deep South .
Turn 471, F (Professor): So - s so it 's not really from the US either .
Turn 472, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 473, F (Professor): Is that {disfmarker} ? OK .
Turn 474, C (Grad): Yeah . OK . And , um , with within the training corporas um , we 're , uh , thinking about , um , training with noise . So , incorporating the same kinds of noises that , um , Aurora is in incorporating in their , um {disfmarker} in their training corpus . Um , I don't think we we 're given the , uh {disfmarker} the unseen noise conditions , though , right ?
Turn 475, F (Professor): I think what they were saying was that , um , for this next test there 's gonna be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you 're not .
Turn 476, C (Grad): Like {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . OK .
Turn 477, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 478, F (Professor): So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the {disfmarker} the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not .
Turn 479, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 480, F (Professor): I think that 's right .
Turn 481, C (Grad): So , I guess we can't train on {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} the unseen noise conditions .
Turn 482, F (Professor): Well , not if it 's not seen ,
Turn 483, C (Grad): Right . If {disfmarker} Not if it 's unseen .
Turn 484, F (Professor): yeah .
Turn 485, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 486, F (Professor): OK . I mean , i i i i it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that 's at least a little bit noisy it can {disfmarker} it can help you out in other kinds of noise even if it 's not matching just because there 's some more variance that you 've built into things . But , but , uh ,
Turn 487, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 488, F (Professor): uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time . So . OK , so that 's your training corpus ,
Turn 489, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 490, F (Professor): and then your testing corpus {disfmarker} ?
Turn 491, C (Grad): Um , the testing corporas are , um , just , um , the same ones as Aurora testing . And , that includes , um , the English Spa - um , Italian . Finnish .
Turn 492, E (PhD): Finnish .
Turn 493, C (Grad): Uh , we ' r we 're gonna get German , right ? Ge - {comment} At the final test will have German .
Turn 494, F (Professor): Well , so , yeah , the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish ,
Turn 495, G (PhD): Uh , yeah .
Turn 496, F (Professor): right ?
Turn 497, C (Grad): Right .
Turn 498, G (PhD): The s yeah , the Spanish , perhaps ,
Turn 499, C (Grad): Spanish . Oh yeah , we can {disfmarker} we can test on s Spanish .
Turn 500, G (PhD): we will have . Yeah . But the {disfmarker} the Aurora Spanish , I mean .
Turn 501, C (Grad): Oh yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 502, F (Professor): Oh , there 's a {disfmarker} there 's Spanish testing in the Aurora ?
Turn 503, G (PhD): Uh , not yet , but , uh , yeah , uh , e
Turn 504, E (PhD): Yeah , it 's preparing .
Turn 505, G (PhD): pre they are preparing it ,
Turn 506, E (PhD): They are preparing .
Turn 507, G (PhD): and , well , according to Hynek it will be {disfmarker} we will have this at the end of November , or {disfmarker} Um .
Turn 508, F (Professor): OK , so , uh , something like seven things in each , uh {disfmarker} each column .
Turn 509, G (PhD): Yeah {disfmarker}
Turn 510, F (Professor): So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , {vocalsound} different systems that are going to be developed . There 's three of you .
Turn 511, C (Grad): Yeah . One hundred each , about .
Turn 512, F (Professor): Uh , so that 's hundred and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hundred and fourteen each .
Turn 513, D (Grad): What a what about noise conditions ?
Turn 514, F (Professor): What ?
Turn 515, D (Grad): w Don't we need to put in the column for noise conditions ?
Turn 516, F (Professor): Are you just trying to be difficult ?
Turn 517, D (Grad): No , I just don't understand .
Turn 518, C (Grad): Well , th uh , when {disfmarker} when I put these testings on there , I 'm assumi
Turn 519, F (Professor): I 'm just kidding . Yeah .
Turn 520, C (Grad): There - there 's three {disfmarker} three tests . Um , type - A , type - B , and type - C . And they 're all {disfmarker} they 're all gonna be test tested , um , with one training of the HTK system . Um , there 's a script that tests all three different types of noise conditions . Test - A is like a matched noise . Test - B is a {disfmarker} is a slightly mismatched . And test - C is a , um , mismatched channel .
Turn 521, D (Grad): And do we do all our {pause} training on clean data ?
Turn 522, C (Grad): Um , no , no ,
Turn 523, E (PhD): Also , we can clean that .
Turn 524, C (Grad): we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna be , um , training on the noise files that we do have .
Turn 525, G (PhD): No .
Turn 526, F (Professor): So , um {disfmarker} Yeah , so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a {disfmarker} a training ? I mean , it 's not totally crazy t I mean , these are {disfmarker} a lot of these are built - in things and we know {disfmarker} we have programs that compute PLP , we have MSG , we have JRA you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen , won't take uh a huge amount of development , it 's just trying it out . So , we actually can do quite a few experiments .
Turn 527, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 528, F (Professor): But how {disfmarker} how long does it take , do we think , for one of these {pause} {comment} trainings ?
Turn 529, C (Grad): That 's a good question .
Turn 530, A (PhD): What about combinations of things ?
Turn 531, F (Professor): Oh yeah , that 's right . I mean , cuz , so , for instance , I think the major advantage of MSG {disfmarker}
Turn 532, C (Grad): Oh !
Turn 533, F (Professor): Yeah ,
Turn 534, C (Grad): Och !
Turn 535, F (Professor): good point . A major advantage of MSG , I see , th that we 've seen in the past is combined with PLP .
Turn 536, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 537, F (Professor): Um .
Turn 538, C (Grad): Now , this is turning into a four - dimensional cube ?
Turn 539, A (PhD): Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension .
Turn 540, B (PhD): Or you just add it to the features .
Turn 541, E (PhD): No .
Turn 542, C (Grad): Just {disfmarker}
Turn 543, E (PhD): Here .
Turn 544, C (Grad): Oh , yeah . OK .
Turn 545, F (Professor): Yeah , so , I mean , you don't wanna , uh {disfmarker} Let 's see , seven choose two would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} be , uh , twenty - one different combinations . Um .
Turn 546, B (PhD): It 's not a complete set of combinations , though ,
Turn 547, F (Professor): Probably {disfmarker}
Turn 548, B (PhD): right ? It 's not a complete set of combinations , though ,
Turn 549, F (Professor): What ?
Turn 550, B (PhD): right ?
Turn 551, C (Grad): No .
Turn 552, F (Professor): Yeah , I hope not . Yeah , there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 553, C (Grad): That would be {disfmarker}
Turn 554, F (Professor): Uh , yeah , so PLP and MSG I think we definitely wanna try cuz we 've had a lot of good experience with putting those together .
Turn 555, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 556, F (Professor): Um . Yeah .
Turn 557, A (PhD): When you do that , you 're increasing the size of the inputs to the net . Do you have to reduce the hidden layer , or something ?
Turn 558, F (Professor): Well , so {disfmarker} I mean , so i it doesn't increase the number of trainings .
Turn 559, A (PhD): No , no , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net . Do you have to worry about keeping that the same , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 560, F (Professor): Uh , I don't think so .
Turn 561, B (PhD): There 's a computation limit , though , isn't there ?
Turn 562, F (Professor): Yeah , I mean , it 's just more compu Excuse me ?
Turn 563, B (PhD): Isn't there like a limit {pause} on the computation load , or d latency , or something like that for Aurora task ?
Turn 564, F (Professor): Oh yeah , we haven't talked about any of that at all , have we ?
Turn 565, C (Grad): No .
Turn 566, F (Professor): Yeah , so , there 's not really a limit . What it is is that there 's {disfmarker} there 's , uh {disfmarker} it 's just penalty , you know ? That {disfmarker} that if you 're using , uh , a megabyte , then they 'll say that 's very nice , but , of course , it will never go on a cheap cell phone .
Turn 567, B (PhD): OK .
Turn 568, F (Professor): Um . And , u uh , I think the computation isn't so much of a problem . I think it 's more the memory . Uh , and , expensive cell phones , exa expensive hand - helds , and so forth , are gonna have lots of memory . So it 's just that , uh , these people see the {disfmarker} the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market , so .
Turn 569, B (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 570, F (Professor): Um . But , yeah , I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out , um {disfmarker} It 's not really two to the seventh . But it 's {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings cuz these were all trained individually . Right ? So , uh , if you have all of these nets trained some place , then , uh , you can combine their outputs and do the KL transformation and so forth
Turn 571, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 572, F (Professor): and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} So , what it {disfmarker} it blows out is the number of uh testings . And , you know {disfmarker} and the number of times you do that last part . But that last part , I think , is so {disfmarker} has gotta be pretty quick , so . Uh . Right ? I mean , it 's just running the data through {disfmarker}
Turn 573, C (Grad): Oh .
Turn 574, A (PhD): But wh what about a net that 's trained on multiple languages , though ?
Turn 575, F (Professor): Well , you gotta do the KL transformation ,
Turn 576, G (PhD): Eight {disfmarker} y
Turn 577, F (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 578, A (PhD): Is that just separate nets for each language then combined , or is that actually one net trained on ?
Turn 579, E (PhD): Necessary to put in .
Turn 580, F (Professor): Good question .
Turn 581, G (PhD): Uh , probably one net . Well . Uh .
Turn 582, F (Professor): One would think one net ,
Turn 583, G (PhD): So .
Turn 584, F (Professor): but we 've {disfmarker} I don't think we 've tested that . Right ?
Turn 585, G (PhD): So , in the broader training corpus we can {disfmarker} we can use , uh , the three , or , a combination of {disfmarker} of two {disfmarker} two languages .
Turn 586, E (PhD): Database three .
Turn 587, A (PhD): In one net . Mm - hmm .
Turn 588, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 589, F (Professor): Yeah , so , I guess the first thing is if w if we know how much a {disfmarker} how long a {disfmarker} a training takes , if we can train up all these {disfmarker} these combinations , uh , then we can start working on testing of them individually , and in combination . Right ?
Turn 590, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 591, F (Professor): Because the putting them in combination , I think , is not as much computationally as the r training of the nets in the first place . Right ?
Turn 592, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 593, F (Professor): So y you do have to compute the KL transformation . Uh , which is a little bit , but it 's not too much .
Turn 594, G (PhD): It 's not too much ,
Turn 595, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 596, G (PhD): no .
Turn 597, F (Professor): So it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 598, G (PhD): But {disfmarker} Yeah . But there is the testing also , which implies training , uh , the HTK models
Turn 599, E (PhD): The {disfmarker} the model {disfmarker} the HTK model .
Turn 600, G (PhD): and , well ,
Turn 601, F (Professor): Uh , right .
Turn 602, G (PhD): it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 603, F (Professor): Right . So if you do have lots of combinations , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 604, G (PhD): yeah . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not so long . It @ @ {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 605, F (Professor): How long does it take for an , uh , HTK training ?
Turn 606, G (PhD): It 's around six hours , I think .
Turn 607, E (PhD): It depends on the {disfmarker}
Turn 608, G (PhD): For training and testing , yeah .
Turn 609, E (PhD): More than six hours .
Turn 610, G (PhD): More .
Turn 611, E (PhD): For the Italian , yes . Maybe one day .
Turn 612, G (PhD): One day ?
Turn 613, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 614, F (Professor): For HTK ?
Turn 615, E (PhD): Well .
Turn 616, F (Professor): Really ? Running on what ?
Turn 617, E (PhD): Uh , M {disfmarker} MFCC .
Turn 618, F (Professor): No , I 'm sorry , ru running on what machine ?
Turn 619, E (PhD): Uh , Ravioli .
Turn 620, F (Professor): Uh , I don't know what Ravioli is . Is it {disfmarker} is it an Ultra - five , or is it a {disfmarker} ?
Turn 621, E (PhD): mmm Um . Who is that ?
Turn 622, A (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 623, C (Grad): I don't know .
Turn 624, E (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 625, B (PhD): I don't know what a Ravioli is .
Turn 626, E (PhD): I don't know .
Turn 627, C (Grad): I don't know .
Turn 628, B (PhD): We can check really quickly , I guess .
Turn 629, G (PhD): Yeah , I I think it 's - it 's - it 's not so long because , well , the TI - digits test data is about , uh how many hours ? Uh , th uh , thirty hours of speech , I think ,
Turn 630, F (Professor): It 's a few hours .
Turn 631, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 632, F (Professor): Yeah . {vocalsound} Right ,
Turn 633, G (PhD): something like that . And it p Well .
Turn 634, F (Professor): so , I mean , clearly , there {disfmarker} there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines .
Turn 635, G (PhD): It 's six hours .
Turn 636, F (Professor): Right ? So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} w we {disfmarker} I mean there 's plenty of machines here and they 're n they 're often not in {disfmarker} in a great {disfmarker} great deal of use . So , I mean , I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's key that {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} that you look at , uh , you know , what machines are fast , what machines are used a lot {disfmarker} Uh , are we still using P - make ? Is that {disfmarker} ?
Turn 637, C (Grad): Oh , I don't know how w how we would P - make this , though . Um .
Turn 638, F (Professor): Well , you have a {disfmarker} I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the {disfmarker} uh , a all these combinations ,
Turn 639, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 640, F (Professor): right ?
Turn 641, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 642, F (Professor): Um . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} let 's say it 's six hours or eight hours , or something for the training of HTK . How long is it for training of {disfmarker} of , uh , the neural net ?
Turn 643, C (Grad): The neural net ? Um .
Turn 644, G (PhD): I would say two days .
Turn 645, A (PhD): Depends on the corpuses , right ?
Turn 646, E (PhD): It depends .
Turn 647, B (PhD): It s also depends on the net .
Turn 648, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 649, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 650, E (PhD): Depends on the corpus .
Turn 651, B (PhD): How big is the net ?
Turn 652, E (PhD): For Albayzin I trained on neural network , uh , was , um , one day also .
Turn 653, F (Professor): Uh , but on what machine ?
Turn 654, C (Grad): On a SPERT board .
Turn 655, E (PhD): Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the neural net SPERT .
Turn 656, C (Grad): Y you did a {disfmarker} you did it on a SPERT board .
Turn 657, E (PhD): Yes .
Turn 658, F (Professor): OK , again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards .
Turn 659, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 660, F (Professor): And I think there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now .
Turn 661, A (PhD): Is it faster to do it on the SPERT , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 662, F (Professor): Uh , don't know .
Turn 663, C (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} it 's still a little faster on the
Turn 664, F (Professor): Used to be .
Turn 665, A (PhD): Is it ?
Turn 666, C (Grad): Yeah , yeah . Ad - Adam {disfmarker} Adam did some testing . Or either Adam or {disfmarker} or Dan did some testing and they found that the SPERT board 's still {disfmarker} still faster .
Turn 667, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 668, C (Grad): And the benefits is that , you know , you run out of SPERT and then you can do other things on your {disfmarker} your computer ,
Turn 669, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 670, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 671, C (Grad): and you don't {disfmarker}
Turn 672, F (Professor): Yeah . So you could be {disfmarker} we have quite a few SPERT boards . You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT {disfmarker} different SPERT boards and {disfmarker} and have ten other jobs running on different computers . So , it 's got to take that sort of thing , or {disfmarker} or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these .
Turn 673, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 674, F (Professor):  So this is {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean , I kind of like this because what it {disfmarker} No {disfmarker}
Turn 675, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 676, F (Professor): uh , no , what I like about it is we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we do have a problem that we have very limited time . You know , so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a {disfmarker} quite a bit of computational resource available if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used . And uh , on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is {disfmarker} is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort {disfmarker} " that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 677, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 678, F (Professor): I think it 's a great thing to go to . But if it 's new , then we have this development and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and learning process t to {disfmarker} to go through on top of {disfmarker} just the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} all the {disfmarker} all the work . So , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't see how we 'd do it . So what I like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do .
Turn 679, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 680, F (Professor): And {disfmarker} and all the kinds of data that we , at this point , already have . And , uh , you 're just saying let 's look at the outer product of all of these things and see if we can calculate them . a a Am I {disfmarker} am I interpreting this correctly ? Is this sort of what {disfmarker} what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ?
Turn 681, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 682, F (Professor): OK .
Turn 683, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 684, F (Professor): So {disfmarker} so then I think it 's just the {disfmarker} the missing piece is that you need to , uh , you know {disfmarker} you know , talk to {disfmarker} talk to , uh , Chuck , talk to , uh , Adam , uh , sort out about , uh , what 's the best way to really , you know , attack this as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a mass problem in terms of using many machines . Uh , and uh , then , you know , set it up in terms of scripts and so forth , and {disfmarker} uh , in {disfmarker} in kind o some kind of structured way . Uh . Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing . And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently ,
Turn 685, C (Grad): Mmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 686, F (Professor): that , you know , we 're not {disfmarker} we won't be contributing that much . Um . And , uh {disfmarker} Then , uh , like , we 're there .
Turn 687, B (PhD): How big are the nets you 're using ?
Turn 688, C (Grad): Um , for the {disfmarker} for nets trained on digits , {comment} um , we have been using , uh , four hundred order hidden units . And , um , for the broader class nets we 're {disfmarker} we 're going to increase that because the , um , the digits nets only correspond to about twenty phonemes .
Turn 689, B (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 690, C (Grad): So .
Turn 691, F (Professor): Broader class ?
Turn 692, C (Grad): Um , the broader {disfmarker} broader training corpus nets like TIMIT . Um , w we 're gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 693, F (Professor): Oh , it 's not actually broader class , it 's actually finer class , but you mean {disfmarker} y You mean {vocalsound} more classes .
Turn 694, C (Grad): Right . Right . Yeah . More classes . Right , right . More classes .
Turn 695, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 696, C (Grad): That 's what I mean .
Turn 697, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 698, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . And . Yeah .
Turn 699, F (Professor): Carmen , did you {disfmarker} do you have something else to add ? We {disfmarker} you haven't talked too much , and {disfmarker}
Turn 700, E (PhD): D I begin to work with the Italian database to {disfmarker} nnn , to {disfmarker} with the f front - end and with the HTK program and the @ @ . And I trained eh , with the Spanish two neural network with PLP and with LogRASTA PLP . I don't know exactly what is better if {disfmarker} if LogRASTA or JRASTA .
Turn 701, F (Professor): Well , um , JRASTA has the potential to do better , but it doesn't always . It 's {disfmarker} i i JRASTA is more complicated . It 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} instead of doing RASTA with a log , you 're doing RASTA with a log - like function that varies depending on a J parameter , uh , which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is . So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is .
Turn 702, E (PhD): Hm - hmm .
Turn 703, F (Professor): And so in JRASTA you attempt to do that . It 's a little complicated because once you do that , you end up in some funny domain and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards , which requires some tables . And , uh ,
Turn 704, E (PhD): Hm - hmm .
Turn 705, F (Professor): so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little messier , uh , there 's more ways that it can go wrong , uh , but if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you 're careful with it , it can do better .
Turn 706, E (PhD): It 's a bit {disfmarker} I 'll do better .
Turn 707, F (Professor): So , it 's {disfmarker} So .
Turn 708, E (PhD): Um , and I think to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to recognize the Italian digits with the neural netw Spanish neural network , and also to train another neural network with the Spanish digits , the database of Spanish digits . And I working that .
Turn 709, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 710, E (PhD): But prepa to prepare the {disfmarker} the database are difficult . Was for me , n it was a difficult work last week with the labels because the {disfmarker} the program with the label obtained that I have , the Albayzin , is different w to the label to train the neural network . And {pause} {vocalsound} that is another work that we must to do , to {disfmarker} to change .
Turn 711, F (Professor): I {disfmarker} I didn't understand .
Turn 712, E (PhD): Uh , for example Albayzin database was labeled automatically with HTK . It 's not hand {disfmarker} it 's not labels by hand .
Turn 713, F (Professor): Oh , " l labeled " .
Turn 714, E (PhD): Labels .
Turn 715, F (Professor): I 'm sorry ,
Turn 716, E (PhD): I 'm sorry ,
Turn 717, F (Professor): I have a p I had a problem with {vocalsound} the pronunciation .
Turn 718, E (PhD): I 'm sorry . The labels . I 'm sorry . The labels .
Turn 719, F (Professor): Yeah , OK .
Turn 720, E (PhD): Oh , also that {disfmarker}
Turn 721, F (Professor): So , OK , so let 's start over .
Turn 722, E (PhD): Yes .
Turn 723, F (Professor): So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled , and {disfmarker} and you 're saying about the Spanish ?
Turn 724, E (PhD): The Spanish labels ? That was in different format , that the format for the em {disfmarker} the program to train the neural network .
Turn 725, F (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 726, E (PhD): I necessary to convert . And someti well {disfmarker}
Turn 727, A (PhD): So you 're just having a problem converting the labels .
Turn 728, E (PhD): It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , but n yes , because they have one program , Feacalc , but no , l LabeCut , l LabeCut , but don't {disfmarker} doesn't , eh , include the HTK format to convert .
Turn 729, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 730, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 731, E (PhD): And , I don't know what . I ask {disfmarker} e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that , and h they {disfmarker} he say me that h he does doesn't any {disfmarker} any s any form to {disfmarker} to do that . And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format , and HTK is an ASCII format . And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed
Turn 732, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 733, E (PhD): and they used LabCut to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to pass .
Turn 734, F (Professor): OK , yeah .
Turn 735, E (PhD): Actually that was complicated ,
Turn 736, F (Professor): So you
Turn 737, E (PhD): but well , I know how we can did that {disfmarker} do that .
Turn 738, F (Professor): Sure . So it 's just usual kind of uh {disfmarker} sometimes say housekeeping , right ? To get these {disfmarker} get these things sorted out .
Turn 739, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 740, F (Professor): So it seems like there 's {disfmarker} there 's some peculiarities of the , uh {disfmarker} of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out . And then , um , if {disfmarker} if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the {disfmarker} the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less . And , uh , uh , we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI , so I think that i if {disfmarker} What 's {disfmarker} what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way , so that , uh , once these {disfmarker} all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank
Turn 741, E (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 742, F (Professor): and {disfmarker} and push all of us through , and then finally figure out what 's best .
Turn 743, C (Grad): Yeah . Um , I {disfmarker} I was thinking two things . Uh , the first thing was , um {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we actually had thought of this as sort of like , um {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not in stages , {comment} but more along the {disfmarker} the time axis . Just kind of like one stream at a time ,
Turn 744, F (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 745, C (Grad): je - je - je - je - je {comment} check out the results and {disfmarker} and go that way .
Turn 746, F (Professor): Oh , yeah , yeah , sure . No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops ,
Turn 747, C (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 748, F (Professor): right ? And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that ,
Turn 749, C (Grad): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 750, F (Professor): right ? And you 're going through them all . That {disfmarker} that 's what I meant .
Turn 751, C (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 752, F (Professor): And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , {vocalsound} concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all .
Turn 753, C (Grad): Mm - hmm . OK .
Turn 754, F (Professor): OK , so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away .
Turn 755, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 756, F (Professor): Which of the combinations across {disfmarker} you know , what are the most likely ones , and {disfmarker} And , uh , I still think we could do a lot of them . I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something . But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something , and that 's probably more than we can do . Uh , but a hundred is a lot . And {disfmarker} and , uh , um {disfmarker}
Turn 757, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 758, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 759, C (Grad): Yeah , and the {disfmarker} the second thing was about scratch space . And I think you sent an email about , um , e scratch space for {disfmarker} for people to work on . And I know that , uh , Stephane 's working from an NT machine , so his {disfmarker} his home directory exists somewhere else .
Turn 760, F (Professor): His {disfmarker} his stuff is somewhere else , yeah . Yeah , I mean , my point I {disfmarker} I want to {disfmarker} Yeah , thanks for bring it back to that . My {disfmarker} th I want to clarify my point about that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that Chuck repeated in his note . Um . We 're {disfmarker} over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place ,
Turn 761, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 762, F (Professor): but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines . And we have reached the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the machines are getting faster and faster . So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another .
Turn 763, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 764, F (Professor): So , you {disfmarker} you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do {disfmarker} don't want to have the {disfmarker} the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being {disfmarker} where the computation 's being done if you can help it .
Turn 765, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 766, F (Professor): Uh . Now , we are getting more disk for the central file server , which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said . But the idea is that , uh , suppose you 're working with , uh , this big bunch of multi multilingual databases . Um , you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server .
Turn 767, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 768, F (Professor): Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there . And then that way you {disfmarker} you won't have the {disfmarker} the network {disfmarker} you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others .
Turn 769, C (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 770, F (Professor): That 's the idea . So , uh , it 's gonna take us {disfmarker} It may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now , but , uh , we 're , uh {disfmarker} It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get , uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives and , uh , put them on another {disfmarker} another disk rack . We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had , so we 're getting another disk rack and {vocalsound} four more drives to share between , uh {disfmarker} primarily between this project and the Meetings {disfmarker} Meetings Project . Um . But , uh , we 've put another {disfmarker} I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's {disfmarker} that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch . But , uh , are you saying {disfmarker} So I don't know where {pause} you 're {disfmarker} Stephane , where you 're doing your computations . If {disfmarker} i so , you 're on an NT machine , so you 're using some external machine
Turn 771, G (PhD): Yeah , it , uh {disfmarker} Well , to {disfmarker} It 's Nutmeg and Mustard , I think , 
Turn 772, F (Professor): Do you know these yet ?
Turn 773, G (PhD): I don't know what kind .
Turn 774, A (PhD): Nuh - uh .
Turn 775, F (Professor): Yeah , OK . Uh , are these {disfmarker} are these , uh , computational servers , or something ? I 'm {disfmarker} I 've been kind of out of it .
Turn 776, G (PhD): Yeah , I think , yeah . I think so .
Turn 777, F (Professor): Unfortunately , these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet .
Turn 778, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 779, F (Professor): So .
Turn 780, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 781, F (Professor): Uh , haven't been {disfmarker} haven't been doing much computing personally , so . Um . Yeah , so those are computational servers . So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers .
Turn 782, A (PhD): Right . Yeah , I 'm not sure what 's available on {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker} you said Nutmeg and what was the other one ?
Turn 783, G (PhD): Mustard .
Turn 784, A (PhD): Mustard . OK .
Turn 785, B (PhD): Huh .
Turn 786, F (Professor): Yeah , Well , you 're the {disfmarker} you 're the disk czar now .
Turn 787, A (PhD): Right , right .
Turn 788, F (Professor): So
Turn 789, A (PhD): Well , I 'll check on that .
Turn 790, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . " So . {vocalsound} Which , I mean , n these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup , and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d and the {disfmarker} the disks themselves are not that expensive . Right now it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 791, A (PhD): What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K , and it 'll tell you if there 's space available .
Turn 792, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 793, A (PhD): Uh , and if there is then , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 794, F (Professor): But wasn't it , uh {disfmarker} I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch . It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or ,
Turn 795, A (PhD): Well , there 's different {disfmarker} there , um , there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 796, F (Professor): right ?
Turn 797, A (PhD): Right . So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch . And both of those two kinds are not backed up . And if it 's called " slash - scratch " , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine . Um . And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if {disfmarker} um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , {comment} it 'll be called " slash - X - something " uh , if it 's not backed up and it 'll be " slash - D - something " if it is backed up . And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called " slash - scratch " . But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . It 's easy to unhook the external disks , put them back on the new machine , but then your slash - scratch is gone . So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch because , um , first of all it 's not backed up , and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash - scratch . So tha that 's why I was saying you could check slash - scratch on those {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on , um , Mustard and {disfmarker} and Nutmeg to see if {disfmarker} if there 's space that you could use there .
Turn 798, F (Professor): I see .
Turn 799, A (PhD): You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg .
Turn 800, G (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 801, A (PhD): Um . Yeah , and we do have {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , so {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network .
Turn 802, F (Professor): Right , so es so especially if you 're {disfmarker} right , if you 're {disfmarker} if you 're taking some piece of the training corpus , which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the {disfmarker} on the , uh , file server , uh , then , yeah , it 's fine if it 's not backed up because if it g g gets wiped out or something , y I mean it is backed up on the other disk . So ,
Turn 803, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 804, F (Professor): yeah , OK .
Turn 805, A (PhD): Yeah , so , {vocalsound} one of the things that I need to {disfmarker} I 've started looking at {disfmarker} Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ?
Turn 806, F (Professor): Sure .
Turn 807, A (PhD): I 've started looking at , um , disk space . Dan {disfmarker} David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk , which means it 's not backed up . So , um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that {disfmarker} that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space {pause} on other disks . And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there . We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott , um , uh , but we {disfmarker} I would like to go through {disfmarker} sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also . There 's {disfmarker} there 's a lot more space there ,
Turn 808, G (PhD): Yeah , OK .
Turn 809, A (PhD): and it 'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things . So , anything that {disfmarker} that you don't need backed up , we can put on this new disk . Um , but if it 's experiments and you 're creating files and things that you 're gonna need , you probably wanna have those on a disk that 's backed up , just in case something {comment} goes wrong . So . Um So far I 've {disfmarker} I 've copied a couple of things , but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet . Um , and I haven't looked at the {disfmarker} any of the Aurora stuff , except for the Spanish . So I {disfmarker} I guess I 'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk .
Turn 810, G (PhD): Yeah , OK .
Turn 811, F (Professor): Um , yeah , I {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} an another question occurred to me is {disfmarker} is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ?
Turn 812, G (PhD): Um . Well , we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments . Um .
Turn 813, F (Professor): This being {disfmarker} ?
Turn 814, G (PhD): So , but {disfmarker} Uh . So that this could be another dimension , but we think perhaps we can use the {disfmarker} the best , uh , um , uh , normalization scheme as OGI is using , so , with parameters that they use there , 
Turn 815, F (Professor): Yeah , I think that 's a good idea .
Turn 816, G (PhD): u {vocalsound} u
Turn 817, F (Professor): I mean it 's i i we {disfmarker} we seem to have enough dimensions as it is . So probably if we {vocalsound} sort of take their {disfmarker}
Turn 818, G (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 819, F (Professor): probably the on - line {disfmarker} line normalization because then it {disfmarker} {comment} it 's {disfmarker} if we do anything else , we 're gonna end up having to do on - line normalization too , so we may as well just do on - line normalization .
Turn 820, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 821, F (Professor): So . Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing . Good . Um . So , I guess , yeah , th the other topic {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the {disfmarker} for next week 's meeting . Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here . Uh . You know , maybe , have it be somewhat visual , a little bit .
Turn 822, C (Grad): OK . Like a s like a slide ?
Turn 823, F (Professor): Uh , so w we can say what we 're doing ,
Turn 824, C (Grad): OK .
Turn 825, F (Professor): yeah . And , um , also , if you have {pause} sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can {disfmarker} how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to {disfmarker} to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do . And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it . Um . Anything else that {disfmarker} I a a Actually {disfmarker} started out this {disfmarker} this field trip started off with {disfmarker} with , uh , Stephane talking to Hynek , so you may have {disfmarker} you may have had other goals , uh , for going up , and any anything else you can think of would be {disfmarker} we should think about {pause} accomplishing ? I mean , I 'm just saying this because {pause} maybe there 's things we need to do in preparation .
Turn 826, G (PhD): Oh , I think basically , this is {disfmarker} this is , uh , yeah .
Turn 827, F (Professor): OK . OK . Uh . Alright . And uh {disfmarker} and the other {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to {disfmarker} to , uh , do something {pause} {vocalsound} on this . I mean he 's doing {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} he 's working on other things , but to {disfmarker} to do something on this project . So the question is , " Where {disfmarker} where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? "
Turn 828, G (PhD): Um , yeah , I was thinking perhaps if , um , additionally to all these experiments , which is not really research , well I mean it 's , uh , running programs
Turn 829, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 830, G (PhD): and , um , {vocalsound} trying to have a closer look at the {disfmarker} perhaps the , um , {vocalsound} speech , uh , noise detection or , uh , voiced - sound - unvoiced - sound detection and {disfmarker} Which could be important in {disfmarker} i for noise {disfmarker} noise {disfmarker}
Turn 831, A (PhD): I think that would be a {disfmarker} I think that 's a big {disfmarker} big deal . Because the {disfmarker} you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ? The {disfmarker} That {disfmarker} that really throws things off . You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your {disfmarker} your , um , speech detector , I mean the {disfmarker} the , um {disfmarker} What was it ? What was happening with his thing ?
Turn 832, F (Professor): 
Turn 833, A (PhD): He was running through these models very quickly . He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was , in his recognitions .
Turn 834, F (Professor): The only problem {disfmarker} I mean , maybe that 's the right thing {disfmarker} the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do . Um , I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} Let 's fall back to that . But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something {pause} that , uh , an {disfmarker} an additional {disfmarker} Uh , that 's a good thing you {disfmarker} remove the mike . Go ahead , good . Uh , uh . What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . Right ? Cuz Dave 's gonna be around for a long time ,
Turn 835, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 836, F (Professor): right ? He 's {disfmarker} he 's gonna be here for years . And so , um ,
Turn 837, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 838, F (Professor): over years , if he 's {disfmarker} if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot . But if there {disfmarker} if in fact there 's something else {pause} that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're {disfmarker} we 're sort of uh strapped for time {disfmarker} We have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we 've , you know , only , {pause} uh , another {disfmarker} another month or two {pause} to {disfmarker} you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to {disfmarker} to get a lot done . If we can think of something {disfmarker} some piece of this that 's going to be {disfmarker} The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why {pause} it 's possible that it {disfmarker} some piece of could be handed to someone to do , because it 's not {disfmarker} Uh , yeah , so that {disfmarker} that 's the question . And we don't have to solve it right this s second , but if we could think of some {disfmarker} some piece that 's {disfmarker} that 's well defined , that he could help with , he 's expressing a will willingness to do that .
Turn 839, A (PhD): What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ?
Turn 840, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 841, E (PhD): Yes , maybe to , mmm , put together the {disfmarker} the label {disfmarker} the labels between TIMIT and Spanish or something like that .
Turn 842, G (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , so defining the superset ,
Turn 843, E (PhD): Yes .
Turn 844, G (PhD): and , uh , joining the data and {disfmarker} Mmm .
Turn 845, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 846, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 847, F (Professor): Uh . Yeah , that 's something that needs to be done in any event .
Turn 848, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 849, F (Professor): So what we were just saying is that {disfmarker} that , um {disfmarker} I was arguing for , {pause} if possible , coming up with something that {disfmarker} that really was development and wasn't research because we {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we have a time crunch . And so , uh , if there 's something that would {disfmarker} would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that {disfmarker} that it 's {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker} to do a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a poor job is {disfmarker} is pretty quick , uh , or , you know , a so - so job . You can {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can throw in a couple fea we know what {disfmarker} what kinds of features help with it .
Turn 850, E (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 851, F (Professor): You can throw something in . You can do pretty well . But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that , and you worked on for few months , as I recall , and you got to , say ninety - three percent , and getting to ninety - four {pause} {vocalsound} really really hard .
Turn 852, A (PhD): Mm - hmm . Another year .
Turn 853, F (Professor): Yeah , yeah . So , um {disfmarker} And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , uh , even though we 're not {disfmarker} we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and {disfmarker} and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . So if we have to {disfmarker} if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we {disfmarker} if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic {disfmarker} harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , take a while to develop . Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . I mean , one {disfmarker} I think one of the {disfmarker} a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we {disfmarker} we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes . Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail . But the harmonic detail does tell you something . Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is {disfmarker} is real important . So . Um . So , uh . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker} wh that {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him {pause} work on the , uh , {pause} multilingual super f superset {pause} kind of thing . Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it {disfmarker} training a net on that , say , um , from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from TIMIT or something . Is that {disfmarker} or uh , for multiple databases . What {disfmarker} what would you {disfmarker} what would you think it would {disfmarker} wh what would this task consist of ?
Turn 854, G (PhD): Yeah , it would consist in , uh , well , um , creating the {disfmarker} the superset , and , uh , modifying the lab labels for matching the superset . Uh .
Turn 855, F (Professor): Uh , creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages ,
Turn 856, G (PhD): Well , creating the mappings , actually .
Turn 857, F (Professor): and then creating i m changing labels on TIMIT ?
Turn 858, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 859, F (Professor): Or on {disfmarker} or on multiple language {disfmarker} {vocalsound} multiple languages ?
Turn 860, E (PhD): No . The multiple language .
Turn 861, G (PhD): Yeah , yeah , with the @ @ three languages ,
Turn 862, E (PhD): Maybe for the other language because TIMIT have more phone .
Turn 863, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 864, A (PhD): So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset .
Turn 865, F (Professor): Uh .
Turn 866, E (PhD): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 867, G (PhD): From each language to the superset ,
Turn 868, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 869, G (PhD): yeah .
Turn 870, C (Grad): There 's , um {disfmarker} Carmen was talking about this SAMPA thing , and it 's , um , {vocalsound} it 's an effort by linguists to come up with , um , a machine readable IPA , um , sort of thing , right ? And , um , they {disfmarker} they have a web site that Stephane was showing us that has , um {disfmarker} has all the English phonemes and their SAMPA correspondent , um , phoneme ,
Turn 871, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 872, C (Grad): and then , um , they have Spanish , they have German , they have all {disfmarker} all sorts of languages , um , mapping {disfmarker} mapping to the SAMPA phonemes , which {disfmarker}
Turn 873, E (PhD): Yeah , the tr the transcription , though , for Albayzin is n the transcription are of SAMPA the same , uh , how you say , symbol that SAMPA appear .
Turn 874, B (PhD): SAMPA ? What does " SAMPA " mean ?
Turn 875, F (Professor): Mm - hmm . Hmm .
Turn 876, E (PhD): But I don't know if TIMIT o how is TIMIT .
Turn 877, B (PhD): So , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 878, F (Professor): What {disfmarker}
Turn 879, B (PhD): I 'm sorry .
Turn 880, F (Professor): Go ahead .
Turn 881, B (PhD): I was gonna say , does that mean IPA is not really international ?
Turn 882, C (Grad): No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's saying {disfmarker}
Turn 883, A (PhD): It uses special diacritics and stuff , which you can't do with ASCII characters .
Turn 884, C (Grad): y can't print on ASCII .
Turn 885, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 886, A (PhD): So the SAMPA 's just mapping those .
Turn 887, B (PhD): Oh , I see . Got it .
Turn 888, F (Professor): What , uh {disfmarker} Has OGI done anything about this issue ? Do they have {disfmarker} Do they have any kind of superset that they already have ?
Turn 889, G (PhD): I don't think so . Well , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they 're going actually the {disfmarker} the other way , defining uh , phoneme clusters , apparently . Well .
Turn 890, F (Professor): Aha . That 's right . Uh , and that 's an interesting {pause} way to go too .
Turn 891, A (PhD): So they just throw the speech from all different languages together , then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ?
Turn 892, G (PhD): I think they 've not done it , uh , doing , uh , multiple language yet , but what they did is to training , uh , English nets with all the phonemes , and then training it in English nets with , uh , kind of seventeen , I think it was {disfmarker} seventeen , uh , broad classes .
Turn 893, A (PhD): Automatically derived {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Automatically derived broad classes , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 894, G (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , I think so .
Turn 895, A (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 896, G (PhD): Uh , and , yeah . And the result was that apparently , when testing on cross - language it was better . I think so . But Hynek didn't add {disfmarker} didn't have all the results when he showed me that , so , well .
Turn 897, F (Professor): So that does make an interesting question , though .
Turn 898, G (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 899, F (Professor): Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this . Um . Right ? I mean , if {disfmarker} if in fact that is a better thing to do , {pause} should we leverage that , rather than doing , {pause} um , our own . Right ? So , if i if {disfmarker} if they s I mean , we have {disfmarker} {pause} i we have the {disfmarker} the trainings with our own categories . And now we 're saying , " Well , how do we handle cross - language ? " And one way is to come up with a superset , but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered , and do we think there 's something wrong with that ?
Turn 900, G (PhD): I think that there 's something wrong
Turn 901, F (Professor): OK . What w
Turn 902, G (PhD): or {disfmarker} Well , because {disfmarker} Well , for the moment we are testing on digits , and e i perhaps u using broad phoneme classes , it 's {disfmarker} it 's OK for um , uh classifying the digits , but as soon as you will have more words , well , words can differ with only a single phoneme , and {disfmarker} which could be the same , uh , class .
Turn 903, F (Professor): I see .
Turn 904, G (PhD): Well . So .
Turn 905, F (Professor): Right . Although , you are not using this for the {disfmarker}
Turn 906, G (PhD): So , I 'm
Turn 907, F (Professor): You 're using this for the feature generation , though , not the {disfmarker}
Turn 908, G (PhD): Yeah , but you will ask the net to put one for th th the phoneme class
Turn 909, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 910, G (PhD): and {disfmarker} So .
Turn 911, A (PhD): So you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ?
Turn 912, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 913, G (PhD): Well . Yeah , yeah . Mmm .
Turn 914, B (PhD): Fact , most confusions are within the phone {disfmarker} phone classes , right ? I think , uh , Larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents , et cetera , et cetera .
Turn 915, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 916, A (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 917, F (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 918, G (PhD): Yeah , this is another p yeah , another point .
Turn 919, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 920, C (Grad): So {disfmarker} so , maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff ,
Turn 921, F (Professor): But that 's what I thought they were gonna {disfmarker}
Turn 922, C (Grad): right ?
Turn 923, F (Professor): Did they not do that , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 924, G (PhD): I don't think so . Well ,
Turn 925, F (Professor): So {disfmarker}
Turn 926, G (PhD): they were talking about , perhaps , but they d
Turn 927, F (Professor): They 're talking about it ,
Turn 928, G (PhD): I d
Turn 929, F (Professor): but that 's sort of a question whether they did
Turn 930, G (PhD): w Yeah .
Turn 931, F (Professor): because that 's {disfmarker} that 's the other route to go .
Turn 932, C (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 933, F (Professor): Instead of this , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 934, C (Grad): Superclass .
Turn 935, F (Professor): Instead of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the superclass thing , which is to take {disfmarker} So suppose y you don't really mark arti To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and {disfmarker} and see where everything is , and we 're not gonna do that . So , uh , the second class way of doing it is {pause} to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled and translate them into acoustic {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker} articulatory , uh , uh , features . So it won't really be right . You won't really have these overlapping {pause} things and so forth ,
Turn 936, A (PhD): So the targets of the net {disfmarker} are these {disfmarker} ?
Turn 937, F (Professor): but {disfmarker}
Turn 938, A (PhD): Articulatory features .
Turn 939, F (Professor): Articulatory feature .
Turn 940, A (PhD): But that implies that you can have more than one on at a time ?
Turn 941, F (Professor): Right . That 's right .
Turn 942, A (PhD): Ah . OK .
Turn 943, F (Professor): You either do that or you have multiple nets .
Turn 944, A (PhD): I see .
Turn 945, F (Professor):  Um . And , um I don't know if our software {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} if the qu versions of the Quicknet that we 're using allows for that . Do you know ?
Turn 946, C (Grad): Allows for {disfmarker} ?
Turn 947, F (Professor): Multiple targets being one ?
Turn 948, C (Grad): Oh , um , we have gotten soft targets to {disfmarker} to work .
Turn 949, F (Professor): OK . So that {disfmarker} that 'll work , yeah .
Turn 950, C (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 951, F (Professor): OK . So , um , that 's another thing that could be done {disfmarker}
Turn 952, B (PhD): Um .
Turn 953, F (Professor): is that we could {disfmarker} we could , uh , just translate {disfmarker} instead of translating to a superset , {pause} just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that . Now the fact {disfmarker} even though it 's a smaller number , {pause} it 's still fine because you have the {disfmarker} the , uh , combinations . So , in fact , it has every , you know {disfmarker} it had {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} has every distinction in it that you would have the other way .
Turn 954, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 955, F (Professor): But it should go across languages better .
Turn 956, A (PhD): We could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too . We could {disfmarker} I don't know , if you had uh the phone labels , you could replace them by their articulatory features and then feed in a vector with those uh , things turned on based on what they 're supposed to be for each phone to see if it {disfmarker} if you get a big win . Do you know what I 'm saying ?
Turn 957, F (Professor): No .
Turn 958, A (PhD): So , um , I mean , if your net is gonna be outputting , uh , a vector of {disfmarker} basically of {disfmarker} well , it 's gonna have probabilities , but let 's say that they were ones and zeros , then y and you know for each , um , I don't know if you know this for your testing data , but if you know for your test data , you know , what the string of phones is and {disfmarker} and you have them aligned , then you can just {disfmarker} instead of going through the net , just create the vector for each phone and feed that in to see if that data helps . Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature . And because they had done some cheating experiments {disfmarker}
Turn 959, F (Professor): This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus . So , this was Larry Saul who did this {disfmarker} did this .
Turn 960, A (PhD): Oh , OK .
Turn 961, F (Professor): He used sonorants .
Turn 962, A (PhD): Right , OK ,
Turn 963, F (Professor): Was what he was doing .
Turn 964, A (PhD): right . And they {disfmarker} they had done a cheating experiment or something , right ?
Turn 965, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 966, A (PhD): and determined that {disfmarker}
Turn 967, F (Professor): He {disfmarker} he di he didn't mention that part .
Turn 968, A (PhD): Well , Hynek said that {disfmarker} that , I guess before they had him work on this , they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right , it dramatically improved the result .
Turn 969, F (Professor): But . I see . OK .
Turn 970, A (PhD): So I was thinking , you know {disfmarker} it made me think about this , that if {disfmarker} it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right .
Turn 971, F (Professor): Should be . Because if you get all of them in there , that defines all of the phones . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got {disfmarker} {vocalsound} got all the phones right .
Turn 972, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 973, F (Professor): So , if that doesn't help , there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 974, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 975, F (Professor): Although , yeah , it would be {disfmarker} make an interesting cheating experiment because we are using it in this funny way ,
Turn 976, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 977, F (Professor): where we 're converting it into features .
Turn 978, A (PhD): And then you also don't know what error they 've got on the HTK side . You know ? It sort of gives you your {disfmarker} the best you could hope for , kind of .
Turn 979, F (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 980, C (Grad): Mmm . Mmm , I see .
Turn 981, B (PhD): The soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one , though , right ?
Turn 982, C (Grad): To sum up to one .
Turn 983, B (PhD): So you can't really feed it , like , two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones cuz it 'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that , for instance .
Turn 984, G (PhD): But perhaps you have the choice of the {pause} final nonl
Turn 985, C (Grad): Right . Nonlinearity ?
Turn 986, G (PhD): uh , nonlinearity ,
Turn 987, C (Grad): Um ,
Turn 988, G (PhD): yeah . Is it always softmax
Turn 989, C (Grad): it 's sig No , it 's actually sigmoid - X
Turn 990, G (PhD): or {disfmarker} ? Yeah .
Turn 991, C (Grad): for the {disfmarker}
Turn 992, G (PhD): So if you choose sigmoid it 's o it 's OK ?
Turn 993, C (Grad): You , um {disfmarker}
Turn 994, F (Professor): Did we just run out of disk ,
Turn 995, C (Grad): I think {disfmarker} I think apparently , the , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 996, F (Professor): or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 997, B (PhD): Why don't you just choose linear ? Right ?
Turn 998, C (Grad): What 's that ?
Turn 999, B (PhD): Linear outputs ?
Turn 1000, C (Grad): Linear outputs ?
Turn 1001, B (PhD): Isn't that what you 'll want ?
Turn 1002, C (Grad): Um .
Turn 1003, B (PhD): If you 're gonna do a KL Transform on it .
Turn 1004, C (Grad): Right , right . Right , but during the training , we would train on sigmoid - X
Turn 1005, B (PhD): Oh , you {disfmarker} Yeah ?
Turn 1006, C (Grad): and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity .
Turn 1007, B (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 1008, F (Professor): So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're off the air , or {disfmarker} ? About to be off the air .
