I represent the Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia, the only multi-service settlement agency in Nova Scotia and probably the largest one in Atlantic Canada. We've been providing services to refugees and immigrants for over 38 years. We are happy to be here to address you this morning. I am going to speak rapidly, because there is a lot of information we'd like to convey to you but I also understand that there will be time for questions and answers.\n              We know that women's experiences are very diverse generally, and that is also true of immigrant women who are settling here in Canada. We know that many immigrant families come here in a small nucleus, which is perhaps different from the experience they've had in their home country. They are relying on family and friends, if they have them here, who may not be aware of services. Generally, there is a lack of information around settlement supports and networks that may support them during this time. Therefore, if a crisis situation happens to them, it often happens very rapidly and in isolation within the community. Particularly, women who face abusive situations do not report that, partly out of fear and partly because they have no money. If their situation changes, they see their economic security very much tied into that family relationship. It is very often a difficult situation.\n              We also know that immigrant women's economic needs need to be seen through the lens of social determinants, which include family status, race, education, age, sexual orientation, immigration status, and pre-arrival condition, to name a few. This will affect their ability to settle and to feel financially secure. Immigration status affects their economic security. When women become citizens, they lose their ability to access settlement resources. If during the time when they are moving toward their citizenship they are not actively engaged or connected to settlement services, once they become citizens they no longer have access to that. In terms of the transition, it may take them time. They may be at home with child care and taking care of families. They may in fact become citizens without necessarily having the full support for integration. Also, conditional family class sponsorship can be problematic, particularly if it breaks down, because women fear being deported and therefore choose to stay in relationships that are not safe for them.\n              We know that child care is a very large issue, since women tend to be the primary caregivers for children. If they don't have access to child care, that limits their ability for language learning and employment, increasing isolation and reliance on their spouse. As an organization, we do offer child care, but our resources are limited. Particularly for families arriving with large numbers of children within their family unit—as we experienced with the Syrian refugees who have come—it is very difficult to provide the range of child care that is needed to adequately address their needs. The lack of affordable, subsidized, and appropriate child care makes it difficult for women to break out of the cycle of poverty and have economic security.\n              The child tax benefit has been very positive. We'd like to thank the government for the recent changes. It has a significant impact on our folks. One of the issues we've seen is that the benefits can take several months to be given to some of our clients, particularly if there are questions around the global income, or if a refugee has filled out the form wrong or has not realized the importance of having that document in on time. Then it takes a significant amount of time to go back, work through all the details of the application, and get that form filled out. It often leaves families without access to the child tax benefit. That's a real problem with the bureaucracy around that.\n              We've also seen that during the first three months of coming in, refugees don't have access to the child tax benefit and there is no longer RAP funding to support people during that time. Having access to food is very difficult for people during that time. We know that income assistance rates have not risen very rapidly, if at all. There is difference across provinces, but speaking from the Nova Scotia reality, the housing shelter is woefully inadequate. It does not meet the needs of people for finding safe, accessible housing. We also know that, if you are on income assistance, it is difficult to find the opportunity to go to school or to access resources, and therefore to move out of that program and into greater economic independence.\n              \n               We have recognized in our new strategic plan that if we're going to be champions of an inclusive and welcoming province, we need to be involved in looking at the systemic issues that affect affordable housing, accessible health care, and poverty. Those are real issues that are affecting women, in particular, in our community. We also recognize that women who are living with disabilities or in families that have disabilities or women from the LGBTQ community face further difficulties having a successful economic integration.\n              Specifically, looking for adequate and appropriate language opportunities, therefore having increased support for tutoring and child care and being able to access services after women become citizens.... Interpretation budgets are huge, particularly for agencies that are not actually immigrant-servicing. We would love for our clients to be able to access the great resources that are now in the community, but they can't, because these organizations either don't have the cultural competency or do not have budgets to support interpretation of their services. They tend to rely on us, when really, if we're trying to be a community that is broad, diverse, and inclusive, we need to change ourselves in all aspects of our society. Interpretation budgets are key to having that happen.\n              Access to affordable and accessible housing is a huge issue, as well as appropriate and adequate economic support during the person's time as a refugee, and also—if they have to—being able to move onto income assistance so that it actually supports them. We would certainly be interested in any discussion around a guaranteed annual income and the possibilities for supporting women. \n              Refugee women in particular may find employment in places where it's evenings, overnights, and weekends. Often they're entry-level jobs, and the women tend not to move out of those jobs. Also, there often isn't oversight and protection in those jobs to support women, so it can be a vicious cycle of staying in a place that's not healthy, safe, or appropriate for them, and always at a minimum or low wage.\n              In closing, I'd like to say that last year we did a program looking at underemployed professional immigrant women. We noticed six areas we felt were important for employers to consider. One is looking at the credential recognition—"}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "219058", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Pam Damoff)", "contribution": "Sorry, that's your time."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "233087", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Watts", "contribution": "I'd be happy to answer questions about that afterwards."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "219058", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Pam Damoff)", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              We're now going to turn to our friends at Catalyst Canada, from Toronto.\n              Ms. van Biesen."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "230021", "name": "Ms. Tanya van Biesen (Executive Director, Catalyst Canada Inc.)", "contribution": "Good morning, and thank you for inviting Catalyst to be part of the discussion this morning. I've had the chance to speak with some of you before.\n              Catalyst is a global not-for-profit that advocates for the advancement of women in business.\n              I'm going to talk about three areas, specifically the gender wage gap and occupational segregation; tools to strengthen women's economic security; and ways to increase women's entry, participation, retention, and representation in leadership and in high-paying positions.\n              I'd like to take a minute to set the stage in Canada. As many of you will know, among some, not all, of the reporting 710 companies listed on the TSX, which represents about $2 trillion in market value, only 12% of board seats are held by women, and 45% of those companies have no women—zero women—on their boards. Further, 43% of these companies have zero women executive officers, and then another 28% have only one. Finally, fewer than 5% of CEOs of Canadian companies are women. The Canadian stage is not quite what it could be with respect to women.\n              Let me talk a bit about this first issue of identifying the problems that affect women's income: the gender wage gap specifically. Catalyst's research, along with that of many others, shows that wage inequality starts early in women's careers and worsens over time. In fact, studies we've done show that Canadian high-potential women earn $8,000 less than men do in their first post-M.B.A. job and are more likely to start at a lower-level position despite same levels of experience and education. Earning less over a lifetime means that women receive lower pensions when they retire and are at a greater risk of either poverty or a reduced lifestyle than are men.\n              In our view, the pay gap and other gender gaps exist for a number of reasons, including entrenched systemic barriers and unconscious biases, not because women are less qualified than men. I would point to a couple of things.\n              The majority of talent recruitment, development, management, and compensation systems are not designed to correct early inequities. They're built on the notion of meritocracy, which I think we love to latch onto in Canada. Many research projects have shown that merit contains a significant amount of unconscious bias, because merit is defined by those in power.\n              I would also note in the area of gender wage gap that some groups of women experience much larger wage gaps than others, notably racialized and indigenous women, newcomers, and women with disabilities. I have some facts on that.\n              Indigenous women earn 18% less than indigenous men, and 36% less than non-indigenous men. Women with disabilities earn 16% less than men with disabilities, and 48% less than men without disabilities. Racialized women earn 19% less than racialized men, and 34% less than non-racialized men.\n              This should be a real concern for Canada, as our mix continues to change and we have a government that is very pro-immigration. Not only are women being left behind, but racialized women are being even further left behind.\n              On the subject of occupational segregation and lack of access to key growth sectors, I would say that social norms and stereotypes continue to influence girls' and young women's educational paths, and consequently their professional careers. These stereotypes start very early in life, at home and at school.\n               I know that education sits with the provincial governments, but to the extent that the feds can influence what's happening provincially, this education at home and at school from a very young age is critical. Further, biases in the workplace that cause women to leave industries such as high tech—and we're seeing a lot of news around that, for instance, Uber, and Salesforce, and many other companies—have to be addressed through strong leadership, training, process, and systems changes.\n              Turning now to identifying possible tools to strengthen women's economic security, the following actions by both business and government will help.\n               One way is to adopt pay transparency policies. Government mandates requiring companies to publicly disclose salaries and/or gaps between women and men's wages, such as the U.K. government's regulations and Australia's legislation requiring companies to do so, are examples of ways to achieve pay transparency.\n              The second way is to re-evaluate negotiation policies. While women negotiate both promotions and compensation as much as men do, research shows that women are penalized when they do so.\n              \n               The third way is to adopt a prohibition on compensation based on salary history. Several U.S. states and local governments have already proposed or passed this type of legislation—notably Massachusetts, New York City, and Philadelphia—because basing salary on previous salaries leads to a continuation of lower pay for women. \n              The fourth way is to conduct internal pay equity studies, analyses, and audits to eliminate and ensure you don’t have a gender wage gap. Another government policy example of this is the recent Iceland legislation requiring large companies and government agencies to undergo audits and prove that they are in compliance with equal pay rules. \n              Finally, as ways to increase women’s entry, participation, retention, and representation in leadership and high-paying positions, I would point to evaluating recruitment, retention, promotion, and talent development systems for gender bias. Analyze pools of candidates for both hiring and promotion decisions; are they reflective of a broad pool of candidates? Bring an unconscious bias spotter into promotion and high-potential discussions. That can apply to business and government, and not-for-profits for that matter. Challenge recruitment partners to bring forward a diverse set of candidates, and above all, monitor and track progress for compensation, promotion, and hiring decisions, because the data will give you the truth. \n              From a board perspective, in our view there's no one right way to accelerate progress for women on boards. What does matter is that companies set goals for a percentage of women as board directors, and that boards use at least one mechanism to facilitate board renewal, such as age or tenure limits, coupled with board evaluation processes. We believe governments should reinforce the setting of targets, renewal mechanisms, and written policies, and should track and publish progress. We do believe the government should adopt comply-or-explain legislation, such as has been proposed in Bill C-25. \n              Finally, we encourage government to seize on the opportunity to leverage groups, like the gender and good governance alliance, previously referred to in a prior testimony by Beatrix Dart, which is a tremendous alliance of like-minded not-for-profits that can be used as a think tank by governments across the country.\n              Thank you."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "219058", "name": "The Vice-Chair (Ms. Pam Damoff)", "contribution": "We'll turn to questions now. \n              Our first set of questions is from Sean Fraser."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser (Central Nova, Lib.)", "contribution": "Thanks very much.\n              I'll start with ISANS. Thank you for joining us remotely from Nova Scotia.\n              There were a few items you hit on about which I would like to get additional information. \n              You mentioned the Canada child benefit and the fact that newcomers sometimes struggle with the administrative burden due to tracing their global income, or potentially with the new kind of paperwork they may not be accustomed to, coming from a different background.\n              What can we do as a federal government to help minimize this administrative burden, to make sure the families are receiving the benefits we intend them to get?"}, {"turn": 11, "speakerID": "233087", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Watts", "contribution": "Our experience right now is that when there is a difficulty or a problem it takes an inordinate amount of time to have them reapply, fill out the forms, and prove that their children are registered in school. This is so for the families who may be suffering from trauma and trying to understand what their situation is, but also for the staff at ISANS who are trying to scramble, particularly if we have a large number of people coming in. It raises a huge amount of administrative work and leaves the families, most importantly and unfortunately, without access to that tax benefit. In turn, this means that we have to supplement with some of the donations we receive, and people end up going to food banks. They end up desperately trying to negotiate with landlords to prevent evictions, so there is a whole series of things.\n              I think a simpler process is, perhaps, just working out and making the link with ISANS by explaining the situation and telling them what has happened. Let's move forward. Certainly, funding can be withdrawn afterwards if something is found to be irregular. The majority of times it's a simple mistake that did not get caught soon enough that ends up causing this to occur."}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "Another point you raised was the fact that sometimes when a person becomes a citizen, they aren't necessarily fully integrated into the community and could still benefit from settlement services. In terms of the delivery model, I know you are deeply involved, but I'm wondering from the federal perspective how we can assist people in accessing settlement services in the provinces that they're living in after they become Canadian citizens."}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "233087", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Watts", "contribution": "It is my understanding that's a question of funding. We could certainly offer the services. It's not that we don't have the services, it's that we do not receive funding to be able to do that. If there were some acknowledgement and allowance to say that they do count as clients and we understand and recognize that in terms of your service delivery, that would make a difference."}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "Excellent.\n              Shifting gears here, you mentioned, Ms. van Biesen, that you're a supporter of a comply-or-explain type of policy when it comes to promoting women to get on corporate boards. We've heard differing opinions on this issue. Some witnesses have suggested that a quota system is the right way to go. We've heard a number of things. Why is comply or explain the right way to go, in your opinion?"}, {"turn": 15, "speakerID": "230021", "name": "Ms. Tanya van Biesen", "contribution": "I would say that it's one of a number of ways to go. As I mentioned, I don't think there's any one right way to get there. I do support what's being proposed in Bill C-25 as a step in the right direction. I think comply or explain, as currently defined in the OSC, could be tightened up. As you've heard from others, there are a lot of companies explaining with weak explanations.\n              So I'm a proponent of Bill C-25. I think it's the right step for us to take, at least as a first step."}, {"turn": 16, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "You also mentioned that there's a real problem when it comes to the promotion and recruitment of women in not just high-growth sectors but also high-paying positions. I saw this repeatedly in my previous career. When we started our careers, the firm I was with was quite good to recruit young women out of law school. Within the first few years, a lot of them fell off the partnership track. I'm sure there were a hundred reasons why. \n              Again, from the perspective of the federal government, how can we encourage private sector companies to monitor what's happening in-house and do a better job of ensuring that women share equally in the economic benefits of those positions?"}, {"turn": 17, "speakerID": "230021", "name": "Ms. Tanya van Biesen", "contribution": "I think the first and most important thing for government is to model through your own behaviour. I think establishing targets, and demonstrating that if it can be done in government it can done elsewhere, is job one.\n              Second, through government, I would encourage companies to set their own targets and to reinforce that. Frankly, one of the things that I do think is missing in Canada is that while we have things like comply or explain, we are very Canadian and polite. We never want to shame any companies. There are lots of companies out there doing nothing, making no efforts, and making no strides in creating a discussion around the need for quotas. I think those companies should be named and shamed."}, {"turn": 18, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "With respect to the mechanisms available to the federal government, is potentially one way to do this to introduce legislation that doesn't just look at corporate boards but also looks at the promotion of women through the ranks, from the entry level right to the senior management?"}, {"turn": 19, "speakerID": "230021", "name": "Ms. Tanya van Biesen", "contribution": "Yes. I think it gets harder and harder to get all the data, but I do think this should be well beyond boards. We should look at the pipelines. At a minimum we should look at the senior executive suite and boards, and if we can go down several levels, fantastic."}, {"turn": 20, "speakerID": "215908", "name": "Mr. Sean Fraser", "contribution": "Turning to ISANS now, you got cut off at the very end of your statement when you were talking about the underemployment of professional immigrant women.

I really appreciate that.\n              This follows up from what the other speaker was saying in terms of looking at women who are in professional jobs but immigrant women are unable to move beyond a certain level. We have a study, and if anyone is interested, we have an employer tool kit to look at strategies.\n              One of them, as I mentioned, is credential recognition and how to go about doing that. There's helping immigrant women become prepared for navigating the application process for promotion, and looking at issues of communication and what employers can do around addressing issues of language proficiency, accents, jargon, and all of those things that may make it difficult for women to feel secure when wanting to advance but not having the opportunity to do that. It looks at promotion subjectivity and information gaps and feeling unwelcome and undervalued. Then there's the one-size-fits-all approach to recruitment and promotion. Some of the strategies that were previously mentioned would look at women in general, but another lens would look at the situation of immigrant women and how to move forward on that. This would include having diversity and inclusion committees, making sure they're staffed up and trained properly, and making sure there are cultural competency workshops in the workplace, with training and education and mentorship programs.\n              There are also the appropriate orientation packages so that, for women who maybe don't have the cultural work experience in Canada, it's very clear what things they need to be aware of.

One of the biggest issues that they have is the language barrier. Some of the women are actually pulling their children out of school so they can take an interpreter with them to help them throughout the community.\n              Jennifer, I want to focus on things like the prior learning assessment tools that you may have, as well as what sorts of language barriers they have.

I see that within our own communities, regardless of where people are coming from.\n              I think we know that one of the barriers is getting the language requirements. What can we do? I know funding is lacking, but what sorts of programs are available to them now?

In my riding of Nanaimo—Ladysmith, I've heard that the language barrier is one of the biggest challenges facing new Canadians, and women in particular. The Central Vancouver Island Multicultural Society is doing fantastic work and they are providing language training, but we're seeing that it's just not up to them alone to carry the whole load, and, as you say, they're not funded to do this.\n              We're also hearing from them that, even if language training is available, their female clients have difficulty finding transportation to be able to access that training and have difficulty accessing child care. I would like to hear you say really clearly whether you see that increased federal investment in both public transportation and the universal child care system would remove some of those barriers to immigrant women being able to attend language training class, which would then allow them to get into the workforce."}, {"turn": 46, "speakerID": "233087", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Watts", "contribution": "Certainly we would see great public transit systems as being very important in supporting all Canadians, but particularly people who are coming into our country as newcomers and being able to access resources and child care as fundamental things that help support women integrating into the workforce.

We've been hearing from previous witnesses at this panel that paid domestic violence leave is starting to be implemented by some unions such as the United Steelworkers in Manitoba, and it's starting to unfold, we're hearing, somewhere in the Atlantic region. I can't remember where, but certainly in British Columbia and Ontario domestic violence leave has been proposed so that women can get paid time away from work to resettle their lives and families and perhaps not have to leave that job while they are making this transition in their life. Is that something you're hearing about from your client base? Do you agree that paid domestic violence leave as a protected right would allow women to avoid some of the discontinuity that results from employment in relation to domestic violence?"}, {"turn": 50, "speakerID": "233087", "name": "Ms. Jennifer Watts", "contribution": "I certainly think that we'd support that. Probably what we're hearing about most right now, in terms of immigrant women facing domestic violence, is the lack of resources within the shelter community to be able to respond adequately to their situations. Immigrant women may be choosing not to leave situations because, as much as they would like to, the shelters are just unable to provide adequate resources for their cultural context. That's probably what we hear most of right now. Certainly I think the program you're speaking of would be of benefit, but I think for us right now the critical aspects in those situations are having adequate supports, cultural competency training, and interpretation services for shelters. There are also the complexities of having very large families that include young men, and not wanting to split those up but the shelters not being able to respond to the family unit. Understanding that complexity but not being able to respond is very problematic."}, {"turn": 51, "speakerID": "219059", "name": "Ms. Sheila Malcolmson", "contribution": "That's good confirmation. We've certainly heard from other witnesses that in addition to the complexities posed by the makeup of an immigrant family, the lack of shelter space and then the lack of affordable housing to transition out of shelter space means that women have to make the impossible choice of whether to return to an abuser and an unsafe situation for themselves and their families, or to put themselves and their families into real poverty, having to live in completely inadequate housing. It's a double whammy.\n              I'd like to turn to Ms. van Biesen from Catalyst Canada and follow up on some of your comments about pay equity. We have been hearing a lot about this at this committee. We heard from Oxfam Canada that there are no barriers to legislating pay equity to break down the gender wage gap. This is federal legislation that we're looking at. The United Nations committee to end discrimination against women also called out this government for not having legislated federally. A year ago, a special committee of Parliament recommended that pay equity legislation be tabled in our Parliament this month, but the government's saying 2018.\n              Have you heard within your community whether there are any barriers to legislating now, given that Ontario and Quebec did this 20 or 30 years ago?"}, {"turn": 52, "speakerID": "230021", "name": "Ms. Tanya van Biesen", "contribution": "I haven't heard of any barriers.

We found English in the workplace to be really helpful, where a teacher will go into the workplace and work with the employer and either a group of employees or a specific employee, dealing with specific language issues that need to be resolved. \n              Certainly language is very important, as is having a variety of opportunities. Employment counselling services, which we offer, are very important. Again, they run the gamut from learning how to write your resumé to having people come in from HR departments around Halifax, for example, to give the client the opportunity to go through a job interview. There are mentors, and there are Bridge to Work programs that are very successful, giving people training in the specific skills they may need for a job and then an opportunity to have a placement in a workplace to gain that experience.\n              We have a whole variety of tools, so continued and enhanced support for that would be very important. Also, we can do all we do as an agency, but what is really important is that the workplace itself also changes. Resources that support us—or support workplaces in demonstrating cultural competency and learning how to deal with these issues of barriers and successful integration—are also very important. \n              Again, I can't underestimate the work of the international qualification recognition program, as well. For someone like you, who had specific training in your profession, being able to have that translated and moved forward when you come into the Canadian context is very important.

We are not going to eradicate it, but we need to be trained on how to be more inclusive leaders. That kind of awareness and training needs to be put in place.\n              Further, I would say that, within any organization, whether it's public sector or private, we need to ensure that there is, as I mentioned earlier, an unconscious bias spotter or that kind of a role when hiring decisions are being made and promotion decisions are being made so there isn't this bias that creeps into people's opportunities to excel. I think that applies as much to LGBTQ communities as to anyone else. \n              I also think organizations—again, public sector or private—can leverage very strongly their own employee bases. Employee resource groups like LGBTQ communities that form pride groups end up being a fantastic window for the organization to that community of potential buyers, and they also can shed light to the organization on how these people want to feel included.

Being able to do this is really important.\n              We have a continuum of programs. It's hard to speak to one specific thing, but we favour providing a continuum and using a case management approach. We try to learn about the individual, who they are, where they are coming from. We do a strength-based analysis of what they need, what they see as their potential, and how we can provide them with pathways and choices that will help them move forward. \n              To be effective, the program requires flexibility in the resources from our funding partners. If we try to do one specific thing, it's never going to address the reality of our clients and allow us to fit that reality to our programs. One of the programs we're working on right now is career explorations, which involves a youth group between the ages of 18 and probably 25. We have a number of young women in that program.

That includes the Truth and Reconciliation calls to action. Much of what we are speaking to fits within the framework of that piece as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our treaty rights. \n              The Government of Alberta formed this council to provide advice and recommendations to the province to improve the lives of indigenous women in Alberta. The council provides a unique perspective on matters impacting indigenous women and communities. Past recommendations include developing educational tool kits for indigenous parents, developing and supporting much-needed anti-violence programs, and leadership and empowerment programs for indigenous women and girls. These anti-violence initiatives use traditional values and engage men, women, and boys with the hopes of ending violence against women and girls. However, much more remains to be done, and the federal government is integral to this work, which is why we are here today. \n              I'll tell a little story to give you some context. Recently a single mother came to our council members wanting to gain employment. She had to decide between a higher-paying job off-reserve that had potential for growth, or a lower paying, less fulfilling job on a reserve. If she took the off-reserve job, her child care benefits would decrease, she would have to travel more one way, and she would require child care. If she took the on-reserve job, she would have a less fulfilling job without the same opportunities for career growth. However, she would save in child care and fuel. A large number of our women are single, and they face challenges such as this quite often. This woman was more fortunate than others, but still faced difficult challenges and choices.\n              Indigenous women in Alberta are forced to make hard choices every day, and 29% possess no educational certificate, diploma, or degree compared to only 10% of non-aboriginal women. Their unemployment rate is nearly 11% compared to 4.5% for non-aboriginal women. At the time of the 2006 census, based on before-tax income, more than 36% of women, compared to 17% of non-aboriginal women, were living in poverty.\n              Indigenous women on reserve face even greater challenges. They are less likely to possess an educational degree. As we see current trends evolving, even as they do gain more education, finding employment is very hard. I know one of our colleagues made reference to a situation in Blackfoot country, Kainai area, where the Blackfoot names are very distinct, like Black Water and Weasel Head. After they graduate, they feel they just don't get hired. Maybe there's a tendency to not hire women with distinct Blackfoot names. Yes, there's difficulty finding education. \n               When looking at the numbers, it is clear that barriers to economic security for indigenous women continue to exist. Research by Blue Quills University found that the western concept of economy measures success through monetary and personal gain; however, indigenous women focus more on how we take care of each other. It’s about reciprocity, sustainability, and collective success."}, {"turn": 84, "speakerID": "233000", "name": "Ms. Marlene Poitras", "contribution": "The first nations and Métis women's economic security councils have defined economic security as having access to the resources and supports that contribute to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Economic security gives women the ability to provide the basic needs for their families in safe and secure communities, and access to opportunities to participate in the provincial economy.\n              Indigenous women and girls deserve the same opportunities to build healthy, successful, and safe lives as all other women in Canada. In Alberta, indigenous women have lower rates of education and employment, and are more likely to face violence than non-indigenous women.\n               Some areas in drastic need of attention include the following: improving access to quality health services, including mental health services, for indigenous women; increasing educational opportunities by working to improve high school graduation rates for indigenous girls; countering societal narratives that devalue indigenous women; and providing support for indigenous women who move to urban centres.\n              Communities and governments have a role to play in creating greater success and improving the lives of indigenous women. All levels of government should engage indigenous people in the establishment of indigenous indicators for success. Funding and programming should not simply follow market trends, but should consider safety, family, health and wellness, and relationships. Education systems should reflect traditional and current models of knowing and learning.

We are honoured to be here.\n              As background, Statistics Canada reports the largest population of Métis people is in Alberta, where approximately 97,000 Métis live, fully 21% of all Métis in Canada. \n              The council was formally established by ministerial order to provide advice and recommendations to the Government of Alberta on strategies to improve the economic security of Métis and Inuit women in Alberta. The council provides a unique perspective on matters impacting Métis and Inuit women and communities, utilizing research, in-depth discussions, and exploration of potential initiatives.\n              The council has made a seat available for Inuk women to bring an Inuk perspective to, and participate on, the Métis Women's Council on Economic Security.\n              The council has presented two reports and recommendations, one in 2014 and a second in 2016. Recommendations have been accepted, accepted in principle or accepted with modifications by government. The government has prepared annual progress reports for the council.\n              The council is mindful of the importance of process and has developed and revisited its terms of reference to ensure its mandate remains relevant to the lives of Métis and Inuit women. \n              The council also recently engaged in a facilitated session where we determined how best to work together. We decided together what constitutes respectful discussion, how consensus will be reached, and how best to develop recommendations. Recommendations of the council are sourced from the lived experience of Métis and Inuit women, drawing from personal, professional, academic, and geographical aspects of our lives.\n              Council members bring a diversity of backgrounds, and come from urban, rural, settlement, and non-settlement upbringings.\n              The council recently transitioned from inaugural to current members; all are role models and leaders in their communities.\n              Recommendations of the council generally focus on addressing systemic concerns, an indicator of the council's desire to work with government and, if possible, other bodies on the front line of service provision impacting Métis and Inuit people. While expedient, this approach also reflects the challenges of envisioning outside of existing frameworks to enhance the economic security of Métis and Inuit women.\n              As a core principle, the council recognizes the interconnectedness of sex, gender, gender alliances, and the dependency and ties to well-being. This includes recognition and appreciation of connectivity to family and its role in well-being, including economic security.\n              Relationships are key to the success of indigenous communities, and to the success of the council."}, {"turn": 87, "speakerID": "232993", "name": "Ms. Valerie Kaufman (Co-Chair, Métis Women's Council on Economic Security)", "contribution": "Past recommendations of the council include improving the existing link to indigenous programs and services, fostering and supporting indigenous tourism, and improving cultural supports in Alberta's health care system. \n              The government has responded by creating and maintaining a web portal for indigenous programs and services and providing funding to Heritage Park Historical Village to highlight the traditional roles of indigenous women. \n              A research project funded by government is currently under way on authenticity validation approaches for indigenous arts and crafts. \n              The government is providing $100,000 to the Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada to establish an indigenous tourism organization in Alberta. This is an opportunity to help create jobs for indigenous communities, help strengthen Alberta's overall economy, and give visitors a meaningful experience. \n              Funding of $33.5 million through the Alberta jobs plan will be used to build the Indigenous People's Experience and three other key initiatives at Fort Edmonton. \n              The Alberta government is providing $100,000 for a national gathering of elders in September 2017. Representatives from 623 first nations, Métis, and Inuit groups have been invited to dialogue and collaborate on critical issues facing indigenous people.\n              Recommendations for 2017 are under development, with priority given to education and training, employment and entrepreneurship, child welfare, and safety and justice. \n              In terms of national, provincial, and municipal action, the council fully supports and calls for implementation of Jordan's principle, which says that no first nations child should be denied welfare services because of jurisdictional disputes.\n              Supporting and publicizing Canada's indigenous artisans and tourist attractions will help make the country a premier destination for unique indigenous tourism experiences. \n              One important recommendation for your consideration is the establishment of a national indigenous women's council to provide advice and recommendations to federal ministries. The federal government can also play a role in encouraging provinces and territories to create their own indigenous women's councils to make space for the voices of Métis, Inuit, and first nations women. \n              In closing, Minister Richard Feehan, Minister of Indigenous Relations, which supports the Métis Women's Council on Economic Security, has stated:\n              \n                \n                   There are real and pressing issues facing Indigenous Peoples in Alberta and throughout Canada and increased communication and cooperation—between governments and between communities—is essential when addressing these challenges head on. \n                \n              \n              We encourage collaboration and engagement with indigenous communities, peoples, and organizations to ensure that we are not forgotten in the creation of government policy.

In the context of domestic violence, often, as I understand it, there is a cycle of violence that perpetuates itself and makes it difficult for some person in that situation to extricate themselves from the violent situation because they don't have economic security, are not able to get a job, and are not able to stand on their own two feet without some support.\n              Can you comment a little more on the economic security element of domestic violence and what can be done to help alleviate it?

We have one shelter, so our women often get turned away from our own shelter.\n              In terms of economic security for those women, one of the other trends in the communities is that women will often seek education, but they don't go from high school directly. They're more likely to enter post-secondary education as mature students.\n              In terms of programming, how can we help these women who are often living in a cycle of poverty, violence, and addiction? Even if not directly dealing with addictions, how do we build more bridge programs for those women who want to remove themselves from that cycle and begin on a pathway towards self-sufficiency through education?

That's a wonderful initiative, and I think that can be applied right across Canada with all kinds of indigenous groups and organizations.

As a council, we are really considering the authenticity part of it, based on the same thing that perhaps the Northwest Territories and the Government of the Yukon have done, with an authenticity tag on arts and crafts and that kind of thing.

When you're in a first nations community, the health services that are provided do not reflect the same services that are available in the off-reserve community.

Provide mental health prevention that's culturally appropriate and community mandated and developed, all the way from prevention along the continuum to treatment, and then also treatment including.... Suicide is very high in our communities. Once community members leave a mental health facility, if they go off reserve, they're going to have a community health nurse who makes sure they're following up on their care. If they go on reserve, they literally almost fall off the grid.\n               There are different privacy acts that each jurisdiction is bound to. My colleague mentioned Jordan's principle and the jurisdictional barriers. Those barriers appear everywhere. If people were to go off reserve, they would have access to mental health supports.

Certainly, I think it's very important to find employment. I'm a very big believer in the potential of all citizens being used to the greatest potential.

I think that's an opportunity.\n              The hospitality industry is an opportunity. We have wonderful, outstanding new aboriginal chefs who are coming on TV, and all kinds of things, so we're really excited about that.\n              These are some of the high-profile things, but then there are always the industries our men traditionally go to: construction, oil rigs, and that kind of thing. They've always done that.\n               I think it's there. I think we just need to let people know we are there.\n               We're the highest-growing youth population in this country. We're going to have an awful lot of young people who are well educated. Our education numbers are increasing, certainly even in my own personal experience. I remember six graduates in about 1960 from the University of Alberta. We're at a couple of hundred a year now, so they are increasing. Don't quote me on the numbers because I could be wrong. That's a personal memory.\n              I think there are some positives there—I really do—and particularly around tourism. We are really going to hit this one hard as a council this year.

They might take a potentially less fulfilling job that's more convenient, for lack of a better word.\n               I'm trying to figure out how, as a federal government, we can help encourage indigenous women to take part in what they view to be their most fulfilling career opportunity without undermining them by cutting their supports.

Child care is definitely a need. \n              More access to educational opportunities is a need, whether they are online...and maybe more partnerships with universities with local institutions. A few first nations have colleges on reserve, so it's maybe more partnerships with those colleges. For example, you can get most of your education degree, your social work degree...but it's more partnerships, such as those with major institutions and local institutions, and then for those that don't have those colleges, to have more access to online learning.\n              When I advocate for online learning, I'm also advocating for that centre, that capacity on reserve.
