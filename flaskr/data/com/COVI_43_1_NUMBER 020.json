The Liberals announced a $50-million food surplus purchase program as part of the agricultural aid package. \n              Now, one month later, our farmers, who provide the food we need, are still waiting on funds to be delivered. The New Brunswick potato industry is sitting on a massive amount of last year's crop that, because of the pandemic, has no buyers.
