The first one deals with Bill C-7, a piece of government legislation that seems to remove many of the safeguards associated with the existing euthanasia regime. Petitioners are concerned about efforts to remove many of these safeguards. They note, in particular, the removal of the 10-day reflection period. They know that the reflection period can already be waived by physicians in certain situations, but this legislation proposes to eliminate that reflection period entirely.\n              The second petition deals with another piece of legislation, Bill S-204, a bill composed in the Senate which seeks to make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there was not consent. Petitioners are very supportive of this petition.

The banks can and do impose penalty fees and interest on any deferrals they approve, and they are benefiting from near-zero Bank of Canada rates. \n              The government has tools to cut the banks' profiteering, why don't they use them?"}, {"turn": 38, "speakerID": "261828", "name": "Right Hon.

This provides support for seniors of all ages that is comparable for many, and is greater for the most vulnerable. This year we're investing over twice as much in financial assistance to seniors as we committed in our platform. That's $3.8 billion, compared with the $1.56 billion in our platform.

Pay up.” \n              Why won't they change the conditions of the program to allow for tenants to apply directly for the rent? They could covenant or undertake to guarantee that they would use that money to pay the landlord.\n              When landlords are behaving badly, why are we not helping small business tenants?"}, {"turn": 264, "speakerID": "261749", "name": "Hon.

The emergency business account is particularly important. Over 600,000 loans of $40,000 have been applied for and approved.\n              We'll continue to work with small businesses.
