Turn 0, B (Grad): OK ,
Turn 1, F (PhD): That 's looks strange .
Turn 2, B (Grad): now we 're on and it seems to be working .
Turn 3, E (Postdoc): Oh there we go .
Turn 4, C (PhD): One two three four five six
Turn 5, A (PhD): That is weird .
Turn 6, E (Postdoc): This looks good .
Turn 7, A (PhD): It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something .
Turn 8, B (Grad): So , I mean {disfmarker} I don't know what it is . But all {disfmarker} all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with {disfmarker} been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .
Turn 9, A (PhD): Next time you get it maybe we should write it down .
Turn 10, B (Grad): Yep , we will . One of these days .
Turn 11, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 12, E (Postdoc): Was it a pause , or {disfmarker} ? OK . Was it on " pause " or something ?
Turn 13, B (Grad): No .
Turn 14, E (Postdoc): OK . Don't know .
Turn 15, D (Professor): So uh {disfmarker} so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . So , I th I think {disfmarker} I think we should start doing that . Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh {disfmarker} I don't know . Wh - what {disfmarker} what were some of the points again about that ? Is it {disfmarker}
Turn 16, F (PhD): Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .
Turn 17, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 18, F (PhD): Um , at the previous {disfmarker} at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping {vocalsound} about wanting to get more data and I {disfmarker} I talked about this with Jane and Adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new {disfmarker} this new student di does wanna work with us ,
Turn 19, A (PhD): Well , great .
Turn 20, F (PhD): th the guy that was at the last meeting .
Turn 21, A (PhD): Great .
Turn 22, F (PhD): And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,
Turn 23, A (PhD): What a deal .
Turn 24, F (PhD): uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 25, B (Grad): And what 's he interested in , specifically ?
Turn 26, F (PhD): So he 's {disfmarker} comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,
Turn 27, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Great .
Turn 28, F (PhD): so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts {disfmarker} he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .
Turn 29, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 30, F (PhD): But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one {disfmarker} one - time {disfmarker}
Turn 31, B (Grad): One offs ?
Turn 32, F (PhD): Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um {disfmarker} to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some {pause} new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to {pause} listen to . And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need {disfmarker} it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this {disfmarker} this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I {disfmarker} You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .
Turn 33, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 34, F (PhD): Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting {pause} and maybe a networking {pause} group meeting .
Turn 35, B (Grad): Right . Yep . Yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .
Turn 36, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .
Turn 37, B (Grad): So . Mm - hmm .
Turn 38, F (PhD): But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting {disfmarker} {comment} {pause} meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,
Turn 39, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 40, F (PhD): but {disfmarker} rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} {pause} We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds .
Turn 41, B (Grad): Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .
Turn 42, D (Professor): S So {disfmarker}
Turn 43, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 44, F (PhD): See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end {pause} meeting .
Turn 45, B (Grad): Yeah , we {disfmarker} we 've only had three .
Turn 46, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 47, B (Grad): So .
Turn 48, F (PhD): OK . But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,
Turn 49, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 50, F (PhD): like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .
Turn 51, B (Grad): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 52, D (Professor): Now , let {disfmarker} l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I {disfmarker} I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . I 'd like to have lots of different people .
Turn 53, F (PhD): Right . Right .
Turn 54, D (Professor): As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers . So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and {disfmarker} and uh ,
Turn 55, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 56, D (Professor): I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,
Turn 57, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 58, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 59, D (Professor): but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people .
Turn 60, F (PhD): Yeah , I definitely agree with that .
Turn 61, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 62, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 63, F (PhD): Definitely .
Turn 64, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 65, E (Postdoc): Can I {disfmarker} can I say about that {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say {disfmarker} an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that {disfmarker} that uh , it would be useful for {disfmarker} for purposes {disfmarker} You know .
Turn 66, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 67, E (Postdoc): But you know , I think I 've been {disfmarker} I 've I {disfmarker} I 've gathered data from undergrads at {disfmarker} on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And {disfmarker} and the English you 'd have {disfmarker} The language models would be really hard to build
Turn 68, D (Professor): Well , you want to i
Turn 69, E (Postdoc): because it would not really be {disfmarker} it would be an interlanguage rather than {pause} than a {disfmarker}
Turn 70, D (Professor): Well , OK , uh , first place , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I {disfmarker} I think that 's what we 're investigating ,
Turn 71, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 72, F (PhD): It has to be a {disfmarker} a pre - existing meeting , {pause} like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway .
Turn 73, D (Professor): so
Turn 74, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 75, D (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 76, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 77, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 78, D (Professor): So I was {disfmarker} I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their {disfmarker} hold their meeting down here .
Turn 79, F (PhD): That 's I think what we {disfmarker} and I agree with .
Turn 80, E (Postdoc): Oh , interesting !
Turn 81, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 82, E (Postdoc): Oh , I see . Oh , interesting !
Turn 83, D (Professor): Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is um I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that {disfmarker}
Turn 84, E (Postdoc): Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . u The accent 's not the problem .
Turn 85, D (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 86, E (Postdoc): No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , e e just simply fluency .
Turn 87, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 88, E (Postdoc): I mean , I deal with people on {disfmarker} on campus who {disfmarker} I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know {disfmarker} that their {disfmarker} their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .
Turn 89, D (Professor): Oh ! You 're not talking about foreign language at all .
Turn 90, B (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .
Turn 91, D (Professor): You 're just talking about {disfmarker}
Turn 92, E (Postdoc): Well , e I just think ,
Turn 93, B (Grad): We all had the same thought .
Turn 94, E (Postdoc): but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem . I mean , I 'm not saying accents .
Turn 95, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 96, D (Professor): Yeah , then we 're completely gone .
Turn 97, E (Postdoc): I 'm say I 'm saying fluency .
Turn 98, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 99, D (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The {disfmarker} the habits are already burnt in .
Turn 100, E (Postdoc): Well , yeah . I 'm just saying fluency .
Turn 101, D (Professor): But {disfmarker}
Turn 102, B (Grad): Well , I think that , um {disfmarker} I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And {disfmarker} and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , {comment} I {disfmarker} I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .
Turn 103, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 104, E (Postdoc): OK , now can I {disfmarker} can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's {disfmarker} there 's this {disfmarker} this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for {disfmarker} for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together .
Turn 105, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 106, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 107, E (Postdoc): And if people want to approach {disfmarker} Um , i so I know {pause} e e {pause} You know this {disfmarker} The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,
Turn 108, D (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 109, E (Postdoc): but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data ,
Turn 110, D (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 111, E (Postdoc): if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} um , i more fluent , more {disfmarker} more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .
Turn 112, D (Professor): I guess {disfmarker} I maybe {disfmarker} Hmm . I
Turn 113, E (Postdoc): Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have {disfmarker} Uh , so if {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a {disfmarker} as an interlanguage because they {disfmarker} they don't {disfmarker} uh , they can't speak in their native languages and {disfmarker} but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model ,
Turn 114, D (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 115, E (Postdoc): this is the worst case scenario .
Turn 116, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 117, D (Professor): Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group .
Turn 118, E (Postdoc): And {disfmarker}
Turn 119, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 120, D (Professor): because {disfmarker} because they {disfmarker} most {disfmarker} the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards .
Turn 121, E (Postdoc): Well Oh . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their {disfmarker} in their language proficiency that {disfmarker}
Turn 122, D (Professor): I see .
Turn 123, E (Postdoc): And I 'm not objecting to accents .
Turn 124, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 125, E (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a {disfmarker} at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a {disfmarker} a grammar {disfmarker} a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a {disfmarker} a possibility .
Turn 126, D (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 127, E (Postdoc): So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it {disfmarker} to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument {disfmarker}
Turn 128, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 129, E (Postdoc): I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of {disfmarker} of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics .
Turn 130, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 131, E (Postdoc): That 's {disfmarker} that 's my point . Which {disfmarker} which includes both top - down and bottom - up .
Turn 132, C (PhD): It 's difficult .
Turn 133, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 134, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 135, D (Professor): OK , well , i i let 's {disfmarker} let 's see what we can get . I mean , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I think that if we 're aiming at {disfmarker} at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK ,
Turn 136, E (Postdoc): Yes , that 's fine . That 's fine . Exactly . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .
Turn 137, D (Professor): but {disfmarker} OK . OK .
Turn 138, F (PhD): I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose .
Turn 139, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 140, B (Grad): Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one .
Turn 141, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 142, E (Postdoc): Grads and professors , fine .
Turn 143, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 144, B (Grad): So .
Turn 145, D (Professor): Oh , you age - ist !
Turn 146, B (Grad): What 's that ? Well , age - ist . {comment} The " eighteen " is because of the consent form .
Turn 147, E (Postdoc): Age - ist .
Turn 148, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 149, F (PhD): Right , Yeah .
Turn 150, B (Grad): We 'd hafta get {disfmarker} find their parent to sign for them .
Turn 151, C (PhD): " Age - ist " . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 152, D (Professor): Yes .
Turn 153, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 154, B (Grad): So .
Turn 155, F (PhD): I have a {disfmarker} uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a {disfmarker}
Turn 156, D (Professor): They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} yeah , they 're d they 're uh {disfmarker} assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks .
Turn 157, F (PhD): Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And {disfmarker} and I mean , there {disfmarker} there may be a lot more {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance
Turn 158, B (Grad): I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .
Turn 159, F (PhD): Right , but {disfmarker} Right . But if there were such a {disfmarker} I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here .
Turn 160, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 161, F (PhD): So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the {disfmarker} the hardware .
Turn 162, D (Professor): Well , the other thing {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .
Turn 163, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 164, D (Professor): Uh . But . Um , and {disfmarker}
Turn 165, B (Grad): Well , I know that space is really scarce on {disfmarker} at least in CS . You know , to {disfmarker} to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .
Turn 166, D (Professor): Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 167, F (PhD): But you may not need a separate room , you know ,
Turn 168, B (Grad): That 's true .
Turn 169, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 170, F (PhD): the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something {disfmarker}
Turn 171, B (Grad): True . Mm - hmm . Yep .
Turn 172, D (Professor): Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .
Turn 173, F (PhD): Huh .
Turn 174, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 175, D (Professor): You know .
Turn 176, F (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think it 's not out of the question .
Turn 177, B (Grad): Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .
Turn 178, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 179, F (PhD): Um . So .
Turn 180, B (Grad): another type of meeting .
Turn 181, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 182, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 183, C (PhD): But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to {disfmarker} to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI .
Turn 184, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 185, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 186, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 187, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 188, C (PhD): Eh and probably . I don't know .
Turn 189, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 190, C (PhD): Eh , if you {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you {disfmarker} you need {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It - it would be eh eh very difficult to {disfmarker} to put , {vocalsound} eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to {disfmarker} to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device .
Turn 191, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 192, B (Grad): Yeah , but {disfmarker} I think if we {disfmarker} if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .
Turn 193, C (PhD): Oh - yeah .
Turn 194, B (Grad): Right ? That 's very easy ,
Turn 195, C (PhD): Ye - Yeah , yeah .
Turn 196, B (Grad): but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .
Turn 197, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 198, D (Professor): Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a {disfmarker} of a range of them and that 's OK too . Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But {pause} what about {disfmarker} For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone .
Turn 199, F (PhD): Right , I mean , I c I think there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 200, B (Grad): And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .
Turn 201, D (Professor): You actually don't .
Turn 202, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 203, F (PhD): Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone .
Turn 204, E (Postdoc): Which one did you mean ?
Turn 205, D (Professor): You d You don't ne it doesn't {disfmarker} you just need some microphone , somewhere .
Turn 206, B (Grad): Ye - Yeah . Yep .
Turn 207, F (PhD): You can use found data .
Turn 208, B (Grad): Tape recorder .
Turn 209, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 210, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 211, E (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 212, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 213, F (PhD): You {disfmarker} you can .
Turn 214, D (Professor): You need some microphone ,
Turn 215, F (PhD): You can
Turn 216, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 217, D (Professor): but I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 218, F (PhD): use {disfmarker} Um , but I think that any {pause} data that we spend a lot of effort {nonvocalsound} to collect ,
Turn 219, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 220, F (PhD): you know , each person who 's interested in {disfmarker} I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .
Turn 221, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 222, F (PhD): And {disfmarker} So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .
Turn 223, B (Grad): Not enough for others , right .
Turn 224, F (PhD): And so {nonvocalsound} I 'm looking and thinking , " Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so {nonvocalsound} forth if it 's {disfmarker} to help th in my interest . "
Turn 225, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 226, F (PhD): And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal {disfmarker}
Turn 227, D (Professor): Right . So that {disfmarker}
Turn 228, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 229, D (Professor): But I think that {disfmarker} I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't .
Turn 230, B (Grad): Yeah . For some of it .
Turn 231, D (Professor): Maybe if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} If really all you want is to have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a recording that 's good enough to get a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording .
Turn 232, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 233, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 234, D (Professor): I mean , we {disfmarker} we could have a fairly {disfmarker} We could just get a DAT machine and {disfmarker}
Turn 235, F (PhD): Well , I agree with {nonvocalsound} Jane , though , on the other hand that {disfmarker}
Turn 236, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 237, F (PhD): So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , " Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . " I mean , you don't even need the speech signal .
Turn 238, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 239, F (PhD): But what you {disfmarker} what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um {disfmarker} Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have .
Turn 240, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 241, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 242, F (PhD): So I {pause} do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of {disfmarker} of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful .
Turn 243, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 244, B (Grad): Special ? Yep .
Turn 245, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I agree .
Turn 246, F (PhD): Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose {disfmarker} individual studies , so {disfmarker}
Turn 247, D (Professor): Uh but I {disfmarker} I think that the uh {vocalsound} i We can't really underestimate the difficulty {disfmarker} shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .
Turn 248, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 249, D (Professor): And so , {disfmarker} uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , " {disfmarker}
Turn 250, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 251, D (Professor): If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know {vocalsound} keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o
Turn 252, F (PhD): So then maybe we should {nonvocalsound} {pause} try to bring people here .
Turn 253, B (Grad): Here .
Turn 254, D (Professor): I think the first priority should be to pry {comment} to get {disfmarker} try to get people to come here .
Turn 255, F (PhD): I mean , that 's that 's {disfmarker} OK , so
Turn 256, D (Professor): We 're set up for it .
Turn 257, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 258, D (Professor): The room is {disfmarker} is really , uh , underused .
Turn 259, F (PhD): OK .
Turn 260, D (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 261, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 262, E (Postdoc): I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .
Turn 263, B (Grad): Yeah , I thought so too .
Turn 264, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 265, D (Professor): Free lunch is good .
Turn 266, F (PhD): Yeah , I {disfmarker} And I think we can get people to come here , that {disfmarker} But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time {nonvocalsound} and the overhead in bringing people down .
Turn 267, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 268, A (PhD): No crunchy food .
Turn 269, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 270, F (PhD): So {disfmarker} {comment} Well , it would be {pause} lunch afterwards .
Turn 271, B (Grad): Well , I was thinking , lunch after .
Turn 272, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 273, F (PhD): Right . And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert .
Turn 274, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 275, D (Professor): Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't {comment} get {disfmarker} they don't {comment} get their food .
Turn 276, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 277, B (Grad): Um , I had a {disfmarker} I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .
Turn 278, D (Professor): Yeah
Turn 279, B (Grad): Should I pursue that ?
Turn 280, F (PhD): Oh , definitely , yeah .
Turn 281, B (Grad): Yeah . So . They {disfmarker} they originally {disfmarker} They 've decided not to do {disfmarker} go into speech .
Turn 282, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 283, B (Grad): So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask .
Turn 284, D (Professor): Tell them about the free lunch .
Turn 285, B (Grad): I 'll tell them about the free lunch .
Turn 286, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 287, B (Grad): And they 'll say there 's no such thing .
Turn 288, F (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 289, B (Grad): So .
Turn 290, F (PhD): I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird {disfmarker}
Turn 291, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 292, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 293, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 294, D (Professor): The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The oth the other h
Turn 295, F (PhD): well , I know , I shouldn't say that .
Turn 296, B (Grad): That 's alright . No , the they {disfmarker} they 're very weird .
Turn 297, F (PhD): We need a wider sampling .
Turn 298, A (PhD): " Beep . "
Turn 299, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 300, D (Professor): Uh , " beep "
Turn 301, B (Grad): The problem with engineers is " beep . "
Turn 302, D (Professor): Uh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} They make funny sounds . The o the o the other {disfmarker} The other thing is , uh , that we {disfmarker} we talked about is give to them {disfmarker} uh , burn an extra CD - ROM .
Turn 303, B (Grad): Yep . Let them have their meeting .
Turn 304, D (Professor): and give them {disfmarker} So if they want a {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} basically and audio record of their {disfmarker}
Turn 305, F (PhD): Well , I thought that was {disfmarker} I thought he meant , " Give them a music CD , " like they g {vocalsound} Then he said a CD of the {disfmarker} of their speech
Turn 306, D (Professor): Oh .
Turn 307, F (PhD): and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know , I personally {nonvocalsound} would not want a {nonvocalsound} CD {comment} of my meeting ,
Turn 308, B (Grad): Mmm . Of the meeting ?
Turn 309, F (PhD): but {vocalsound} maybe {disfmarker} yeah , {pause} maybe you 're
Turn 310, D (Professor): If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like {disfmarker}
Turn 311, F (PhD): right . {comment} Right . Right .
Turn 312, A (PhD): Oh , that 's a good idea .
Turn 313, B (Grad): It 'd be fun . I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know .
Turn 314, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 315, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 316, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 317, B (Grad): It 's a novelty item .
Turn 318, D (Professor): But it als It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it also I think builds up towards the goal .
Turn 319, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 320, D (Professor): We 're saying , " Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . Is - is isn't that neat . Then you 're gonna go home with it . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you ,
Turn 321, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 322, D (Professor): but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless ,
Turn 323, F (PhD): Right .
Turn 324, D (Professor): and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . "
Turn 325, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 326, D (Professor): So .
Turn 327, F (PhD): No , I think that 's a great idea , actually .
Turn 328, A (PhD): What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the {disfmarker} the transcripts when they come back ?
Turn 329, E (Postdoc): Alth
Turn 330, F (PhD): But we might need a little more to incentivize them , {comment} that 's all .
Turn 331, B (Grad): Oh , yeah . I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out .
Turn 332, D (Professor): Oh yeah .
Turn 333, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 334, F (PhD): Well , that 's interesting .
Turn 335, E (Postdoc): I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , {comment} where maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know ?
Turn 336, D (Professor): Good point . That 's a very good point .
Turn 337, E (Postdoc): So .
Turn 338, D (Professor): So we can {disfmarker} so we can {disfmarker}
Turn 339, E (Postdoc): We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage .
Turn 340, D (Professor): r Right .
Turn 341, E (Postdoc): And then they {disfmarker} they get a CD , but just not the same day .
Turn 342, F (PhD): Oh , right .
Turn 343, B (Grad): Yeah , that 's right .
Turn 344, F (PhD): If {disfmarker} It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically ,
Turn 345, B (Grad): That 's a good point . Right , it can't be the internal one .
Turn 346, F (PhD): right ?
Turn 347, D (Professor): Although it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 348, F (PhD): Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone .
Turn 349, E (Postdoc): There we go .
Turn 350, B (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 351, E (Postdoc): Oh , I like that . Well put . Well put . So , after the transcript screening phase .
Turn 352, B (Grad): Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 353, E (Postdoc): Things have been weeded out .
Turn 354, F (PhD): Otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages .
Turn 355, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right , say {comment} " Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I {disfmarker} "
Turn 356, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 357, F (PhD): That 's a good point .
Turn 358, D (Professor): Yeah so that 's {disfmarker} so let 's start with Haas , and Yeah .
Turn 359, F (PhD): Sorry to have to {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} Sorry I have to {pause} leave .
Turn 360, D (Professor): Oh , that 's fine .
Turn 361, F (PhD): I will be here full - time next week .
Turn 362, B (Grad): OK , see you .
Turn 363, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 364, B (Grad): No . Bye .
Turn 365, D (Professor): That 's alright .
Turn 366, A (PhD): See you .
Turn 367, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 368, C (PhD): See you .
Turn 369, D (Professor): So , uh {disfmarker} Let 's see . So that was that topic , and {vocalsound} then um , I guess another topic would be {vocalsound} where are we in the whole disk resources {pause} question for {disfmarker}
Turn 370, B (Grad): We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I {disfmarker} I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh , {vocalsound} Broadcast News . and it took eleven hours {comment} {vocalsound} to do {disfmarker} to uh copy it .
Turn 371, C (PhD): Eleven ?
Turn 372, B (Grad): And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone .
Turn 373, A (PhD): Where did you copy it to ?
Turn 374, B (Grad): Well , it 's Abbott . It 's Abbott , so it just {disfmarker} But it 's {disfmarker} it 's a lot of data .
Turn 375, D (Professor): Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ?
Turn 376, B (Grad): Tape .
Turn 377, C (PhD): Tape ?
Turn 378, A (PhD): Oh , on the tape .
Turn 379, D (Professor): Oh !
Turn 380, B (Grad): I did an archive .
Turn 381, D (Professor): I 'm sorry .
Turn 382, A (PhD): Ah !
Turn 383, B (Grad): So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files .
Turn 384, C (PhD): Oh .
Turn 385, B (Grad): So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space .
Turn 386, C (PhD): Eleven hours ?
Turn 387, A (PhD): Wow !
Turn 388, C (PhD): Oh .
Turn 389, E (Postdoc): Yeah , the archiving m {pause} program does take a long time .
Turn 390, B (Grad): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 391, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 392, B (Grad): Yep . And so one That {disfmarker} that will be done , like , in about two hours . And so uh , {vocalsound} at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings . So .
Turn 393, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 394, E (Postdoc): One thing {disfmarker} The good news about that {disfmarker} that is that once {disfmarker} once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back .
Turn 395, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 396, D (Professor): Is it ?
Turn 397, E (Postdoc): I mean , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow .
Turn 398, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 399, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 400, B (Grad): Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also .
Turn 401, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 402, B (Grad): So . And that takes a while .
Turn 403, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 404, E (Postdoc): Yeah , OK .
Turn 405, A (PhD): Generating a clone ?
Turn 406, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's a good point .
Turn 407, B (Grad): Two copies .
Turn 408, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 409, A (PhD): Oh !
Turn 410, B (Grad): One offsite , one onsite .
Turn 411, A (PhD): Oh ! Hunh !
Turn 412, D (Professor): S
Turn 413, E (Postdoc): Now , what will uh {disfmarker} Is the plan to g {pause} to {disfmarker} So {pause} stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ? I mean , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I {disfmarker} ?
Turn 414, B (Grad): No , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable {disfmarker} regeneratable
Turn 415, E (Postdoc): OK . Oh , good . I see .
Turn 416, B (Grad): um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And {disfmarker} for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets .
Turn 417, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 418, B (Grad): And so they {disfmarker} they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something .
Turn 419, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 420, E (Postdoc): Wow . Wow .
Turn 421, D (Professor): W w we are getting more space . We are getting , uh , another disk rack and {disfmarker} and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . Uh {pause} so {pause} uh {pause} but that 's not gonna happen instantaneously .
Turn 422, E (Postdoc): Wonderful .
Turn 423, B (Grad): Or maybe six .
Turn 424, D (Professor): Or maybe six ?
Turn 425, B (Grad): The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes {disfmarker} {comment} Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , {pause} you know , fifty percent more .
Turn 426, D (Professor): How many {disfmarker} How much {disfmarker}
Turn 427, A (PhD): Is there a difference in price or something ?
Turn 428, B (Grad): Well , what happened is that we {disfmarker} we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .
Turn 429, A (PhD): Oh !
Turn 430, C (PhD): Oh .
Turn 431, B (Grad): And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . " We " {disfmarker} By " we " of course I mean Dave .
Turn 432, E (Postdoc): Wow .
Turn 433, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 434, B (Grad): So .
Turn 435, A (PhD): Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first {disfmarker} first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE .
Turn 436, B (Grad): SPINE .
Turn 437, A (PhD): And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just {pause} the {pause} CD - ROM type data , the {disfmarker} {pause} the static data . So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked {pause} today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that . So .
Turn 438, D (Professor): So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other {disfmarker} other space now ?
Turn 439, B (Grad): Yep . So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .
Turn 440, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 441, A (PhD): Is that the one that has {disfmarker} is that DC ?
Turn 442, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 443, B (Grad): So . Yep . No , no , well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is . I think it 's DI .
Turn 444, A (PhD): OK , I {disfmarker} but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we {disfmarker}
Turn 445, B (Grad): I don't remember . Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .
Turn 446, A (PhD): OK , DC .
Turn 447, B (Grad): I just don't remember , it might be DC .
Turn 448, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 449, B (Grad): And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .
Turn 450, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 451, B (Grad): Um , someone deleted something somewhere . And so we have some room again . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks . Uh , so , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .
Turn 452, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 453, A (PhD): So should , um {disfmarker} One question I had for you was , um , we need {disfmarker} {pause} we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up {pause} disk that you know of that would {disfmarker} ?
Turn 454, B (Grad): We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk {pause} rather than spreading them out .
Turn 455, A (PhD): OK . Right . Right . Do you know what {disfmarker} happen to know what disk that is off {disfmarker} ? OK .
Turn 456, B (Grad): No . I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head .
Turn 457, A (PhD): Yeah . OK . Alright , I 'll find out from you .
Turn 458, B (Grad): But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it .
Turn 459, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 460, B (Grad): Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk .
Turn 461, D (Professor): Uh , OK , @ @ {comment} So , uh , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my {disfmarker} my agenda was just to hear {disfmarker} hear an update on {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} what Jose has been doing ,
Turn 462, C (PhD): Uh - huh . OK .
Turn 463, D (Professor): so
Turn 464, C (PhD): I have , eh , {vocalsound} The result of my work during the last days .
Turn 465, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 466, C (PhD): Thank you for your information because I {disfmarker} I read . Eh , and the {disfmarker} the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the {disfmarker} the Meeting Recording project .
Turn 467, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 468, D (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 469, C (PhD): And I have , eh , some ideas . Eh , this information is very {disfmarker} very useful . Because {vocalsound} you have the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the distribution , now .
Turn 470, E (Postdoc): I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it .
Turn 471, C (PhD): But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , {pause} problem .
Turn 472, B (Grad): I 've seen it already .
Turn 473, C (PhD): It 's a real problem , {comment} a frequently problem {comment} uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time .
Turn 474, E (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 475, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 476, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 477, B (Grad): Throughout the meeting .
Turn 478, C (PhD): Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , {pause} n I {disfmarker} I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact {pause} mark .
Turn 479, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . Oh , you did that by hand ?
Turn 480, C (PhD): Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by {disfmarker} b b by hand {disfmarker} by hand because , eh , {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker} " Why . "
Turn 481, B (Grad): Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ?
Turn 482, D (Professor): Oh .
Turn 483, C (PhD): My {disfmarker} my idea is to work {disfmarker}
Turn 484, A (PhD): Wow !
Turn 485, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don I don't @ @ {disfmarker} I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't a lot {disfmarker} eh , enough time to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to work . uh , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to {disfmarker} to work {pause} in {disfmarker} in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter .
Turn 486, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 487, C (PhD): Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , {pause} we need eh , eh , a reference {pause} eh session to {disfmarker} t to {disfmarker} to evaluate the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the tool .
Turn 488, B (Grad): Yes , absolutely . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ?
Turn 489, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} No , no , with i
Turn 490, B (Grad): Have you done that or are you planning to do that ?
Turn 491, C (PhD): Sorry ? No , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} plan to do that .
Turn 492, B (Grad): OK . Darn !
Turn 493, C (PhD): I plan {disfmarker} I plan , but eh , eh , the idea {vocalsound} is the {disfmarker} is the following . Now , {vocalsound} eh , I need ehm , {vocalsound} to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly . I {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} I will eh , talk about eh , {pause} in the {disfmarker} in the blackboard about the {disfmarker} my ideas .
Turn 494, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 495, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 496, E (Postdoc): Duration .
Turn 497, C (PhD): Eh , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker} This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker} overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone . I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any {disfmarker} any eh , noise eh , any {disfmarker} any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my {disfmarker} my idea is to {disfmarker} to study the nnn {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify .
Turn 498, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 499, C (PhD): the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech {pause} eh zones . The idea is {pause} to eh {disfmarker} to use {disfmarker} eh , I 'm not sure to {disfmarker} eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a {disfmarker} a cluster {pause} {vocalsound} eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh {disfmarker} to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech .
Turn 500, A (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 501, C (PhD): And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to {disfmarker} to have eh , {vocalsound} a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any {disfmarker} any noise .
Turn 502, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 503, E (Postdoc): Which means that we 'd still {disfmarker} You 'd hear the {disfmarker}
Turn 504, B (Grad): Yeah , fans .
Turn 505, C (PhD): Yeah , acoustic with this . {comment} With {disfmarker} with , yeah , the background .
Turn 506, E (Postdoc): Yeah . {comment} That 's interesting . This is like a ground level , with {disfmarker} It 's not it 's not total silence .
Turn 507, C (PhD): Eh , I {disfmarker} I mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh ,
Turn 508, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 509, C (PhD): eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the {disfmarker} in the eh {pause} speech .
Turn 510, B (Grad): So {disfmarker} so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ?
Turn 511, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 512, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 513, C (PhD): Yeah , I have mark in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in that {disfmarker} Not in all {disfmarker} in all the {disfmarker} the file ,
Turn 514, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 515, C (PhD): only eh , eh , nnn , {pause} mmm , I have eh , ehm {pause} I don't remind {comment} what is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the quantity , but eh , I {disfmarker} I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , {pause} two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to {disfmarker} to this information ,
Turn 516, B (Grad): Whew ! Mm - hmm .
Turn 517, E (Postdoc): Great . Great .
Turn 518, C (PhD): because with the program , I cross {pause} the information of uh , of Jane {comment} with eh , my my segmentation by hand . And {pause} is eh , mor more similar .
Turn 519, E (Postdoc): Excellent . Glad to hear it . Good .
Turn 520, C (PhD): But {disfmarker} Sorry , sorry .
Turn 521, D (Professor): Go ahead .
Turn 522, C (PhD): And the {disfmarker} the idea is , eh , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I will use , eh , {disfmarker} I want {disfmarker} {pause} My idea is , eh , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} to eh {disfmarker} {comment} {nonvocalsound} to classify .
Turn 523, B (Grad): I should 've {pause} got the digital camera . Oh well .
Turn 524, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I {disfmarker} I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label {pause} indicating . It 's a sup supervised and , eh , hierarchical clustering process . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I put , eh , eh , for each frame {nonvocalsound} a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong .
Turn 525, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 526, C (PhD): Eh , I mean , the class you will {nonvocalsound} overlapping speech " overlapping " is a class , eh , " speech " {nonvocalsound} @ @ the class {pause} that 's
Turn 527, B (Grad): Nonspeech .
Turn 528, A (PhD): These will be assigned by hand ?
Turn 529, C (PhD): a I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I ha I h I {disfmarker} I put the mark by hand ,
Turn 530, A (PhD): Based on the {disfmarker} Uh - huh .
Turn 531, C (PhD): because , eh , {vocalsound} my idea is , eh , in {disfmarker} in the first session , I need , eh , {pause} I {disfmarker} I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I {disfmarker} I will cluster , is {disfmarker} is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will {disfmarker} I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems ,
Turn 532, B (Grad): Well , training , and validation . Sure . Mm - hmm .
Turn 533, C (PhD): eh . And {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I 'd prefer {disfmarker} I would prefer , the to {disfmarker} to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth .
Turn 534, A (PhD): You need truth . Hmm .
Turn 535, B (Grad): Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with .
Turn 536, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 537, E (Postdoc): I 've gotta ask you . So , uh , the difference between the top two , i So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} I start at the bottom , so " silence " is clear . By " speech " do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ?
Turn 538, C (PhD): Speech {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 539, E (Postdoc): So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or {disfmarker} or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or {disfmarker} or clicking , overlapping with speech {disfmarker} So , that {disfmarker} that 's all those possibilities in the top one .
Turn 540, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Is {disfmarker}
Turn 541, B (Grad): One or two or more .
Turn 542, C (PhD): One , two , three . but No , by th by the moment n Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 543, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 544, C (PhD): Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I {disfmarker} I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , {pause} or three speaker , or is {disfmarker} is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech .
Turn 545, E (Postdoc): So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with {disfmarker} with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be .
Turn 546, C (PhD): No , no , es especially {pause} eh , overlapping speech {pause} from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh {disfmarker}
Turn 547, D (Professor): No , but there 's {disfmarker} but , I think she 's saying " Where do you {disfmarker} In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? "
Turn 548, C (PhD): Ah !
Turn 549, D (Professor): Which category do you put that in ?
Turn 550, E (Postdoc): Yeah , that 's right . That 's my question .
Turn 551, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , he here I {disfmarker} I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker {pause} without , eh , eh , any {disfmarker} any {disfmarker} any events more .
Turn 552, E (Postdoc): Oh !
Turn 553, D (Professor): Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ?
Turn 554, C (PhD): Where ? Where {disfmarker} What is the class ?
Turn 555, D (Professor): Which catege which category ?
Turn 556, E (Postdoc): Like a c
Turn 557, C (PhD): No . By the moment , no .
Turn 558, B (Grad): Yeah , yeah , that 's what he was saying before .
Turn 559, C (PhD): For {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} by the @ @ no , @ @ because I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to limit the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} nnn , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the study .
Turn 560, D (Professor): Oh , so you {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not marked .
Turn 561, E (Postdoc): Oh . So you don't {disfmarker} i i it 's not in that {disfmarker}
Turn 562, D (Professor): OK . Got it . Fine . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Turn 563, A (PhD): So you 're not using all of the data .
Turn 564, B (Grad): Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those .
Turn 565, C (PhD): The {disfmarker} All {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Exactly .
Turn 566, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 567, C (PhD): Yeah , you mean {disfmarker}
Turn 568, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 569, E (Postdoc): So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech .
Turn 570, C (PhD): Yeah , be Yeah .
Turn 571, D (Professor): Yeah , that 's fine .
Turn 572, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 573, C (PhD): " Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? " because {pause} i it 's the first study . the first
Turn 574, D (Professor): Oh , no {disfmarker} no , it 's a perfectly sensible way to go . We just wondered {disfmarker} trying to understand what {disfmarker} what you were doing .
Turn 575, E (Postdoc): We 're just
Turn 576, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 577, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 578, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 579, E (Postdoc): Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past .
Turn 580, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 581, E (Postdoc): So , this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} a subset .
Turn 582, C (PhD): Yeah . In the {disfmarker} in the future , the {disfmarker} the idea is to {disfmarker} to extend {pause} the class ,
Turn 583, A (PhD): Is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Turn 584, C (PhD): to consider all the {disfmarker} all the information , you {disfmarker} you mentioned before
Turn 585, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't think we were asking for that .
Turn 586, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 587, C (PhD): but eh , the {disfmarker} the first idea {disfmarker} Because eh , I don't know {pause} what hap what will happen {comment} with the study .
Turn 588, D (Professor): We were jus just trying to understand {disfmarker}
Turn 589, E (Postdoc): Yeah . Yeah , we just wanted to know what the category was here .
Turn 590, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 591, D (Professor): Yeah . Sure .
Turn 592, A (PhD): Is your silence category pure silence , or {disfmarker} ?
Turn 593, C (PhD): Yeah . i it 's pure {disfmarker}
Turn 594, A (PhD): What if there was a door - slam or something ?
Turn 595, C (PhD): No , no , it 's pure silence .
Turn 596, A (PhD): Pure silence .
Turn 597, C (PhD): It 's the control set .
Turn 598, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 599, C (PhD): OK ? It 's the control set . It 's pure si pure silence {comment} with the {disfmarker} with the machine on the {disfmarker} on the roof .
Turn 600, D (Professor): What you {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} w {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think what you m I think what you mean {vocalsound} is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises .
Turn 601, B (Grad): With the fan .
Turn 602, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 603, D (Professor): Right ? Cuz you 're calling {disfmarker} what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing {vocalsound} or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises .
Turn 604, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 605, D (Professor): But steady - state noises are part of the background .
Turn 606, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 607, D (Professor): Which , are being , included in that . Right ?
Turn 608, C (PhD): h here yet , yet I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , eh , there are {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} some kind of noises that , eh , don't {disfmarker} don't wanted to {disfmarker} to be in that , eh , in that control set .
Turn 609, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 610, E (Postdoc): So it 's like a signal - noise situation . Yeah .
Turn 611, D (Professor): Well {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 612, C (PhD): But I prefer , I prefer at {disfmarker} at the first , eh , the {disfmarker} the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the {disfmarker} of eh {disfmarker} of noise .
Turn 613, E (Postdoc): Well , steady state .
Turn 614, D (Professor): Right , it 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's {disfmarker} " Background " might be {disfmarker} might be a better word than " silence " .
Turn 615, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 616, D (Professor): It 's just sort of that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the background acoustic {disfmarker}
Turn 617, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 618, B (Grad): Right . So {disfmarker} Fine . Go on .
Turn 619, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 620, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 621, C (PhD): Is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is only {disfmarker} OK .
Turn 622, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 623, C (PhD): And , um , with this information {vocalsound} The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for {disfmarker} for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh {disfmarker} algorithm I {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Turn 624, E (Postdoc): Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah .
Turn 625, C (PhD): Sorry . And eh I am going {pause} to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a {disfmarker} a set of {pause} feature structure eh , eh , models .
Turn 626, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 627, C (PhD): And {pause} my idea is
Turn 628, B (Grad): " Tone " , whatever .
Turn 629, C (PhD): so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} because I have a pitch extractor yet .
Turn 630, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 631, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 632, C (PhD): I have to {disfmarker} to test , but eh I {disfmarker}
Turn 633, A (PhD): You have your own ?
Turn 634, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 635, A (PhD): Oh !
Turn 636, C (PhD): I ha I have prepare . Is a modified version of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University {disfmarker} in Stanford ? No . From , eh , em , {vocalsound} Cambridge {pause} University .
Turn 637, A (PhD): Oh ! What 's it written in ?
Turn 638, C (PhD): Eh , em , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't remember what is the {disfmarker} the name of the {disfmarker} of the author , because I {disfmarker} I have several {disfmarker} I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department .
Turn 639, A (PhD): Ah .
Turn 640, D (Professor): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 641, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} And I have to {disfmarker} because , {vocalsound} in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work {comment} {vocalsound} very well and {disfmarker}
Turn 642, B (Grad): Bad . Right . But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK . So , we don't know .
Turn 643, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . This {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} And {pause} th the idea is to {disfmarker} to , eh , to obtain , eh , {pause} for example , eh , {pause} {vocalsound} eh diff eh , eh , different {disfmarker} well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , {pause} eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty {disfmarker} thirty parameters , eh , for {disfmarker} for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh {pause} to classify {pause} the different , eh , what is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class {pause} eh and what is the {disfmarker} the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error {pause} eh , of the data
Turn 644, B (Grad): Supervised clustering . Mm - hmm .
Turn 645, C (PhD): This is the {disfmarker} the eh , first idea
Turn 646, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 647, C (PhD): and the second {pause} is try to {disfmarker} eh , to use {pause} some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis .
Turn 648, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 649, C (PhD): Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to {disfmarker} to study {pause} what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different {disfmarker} the different parameters .
Turn 650, B (Grad): Mm - hmm . What sort of classifier ar ?
Turn 651, C (PhD): Eh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the classifier is {disfmarker} nnn by the moment is eh {disfmarker} is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier {disfmarker} vectorial quantifier is eh , used to {disfmarker} to eh , some distance {pause} to {disfmarker} to put eh , a vector eh , in {disfmarker} in a class different .
Turn 652, B (Grad): Unimodal ?
Turn 653, C (PhD): Is {disfmarker} Yeah ? W with a model , is {disfmarker} is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity .
Turn 654, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 655, B (Grad): So is it just one cluster per {disfmarker}
Turn 656, C (PhD): A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network .
Turn 657, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 658, C (PhD): But eh what 's the p {vocalsound} What is my idea ? What 's the problem I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I see in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} you use the {disfmarker} the neural network ? If {disfmarker} w when {pause} this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you {disfmarker} you can't {disfmarker} you can't eh , eh put up with your hand {comment} in the different parameter ,
Turn 659, B (Grad): Right , you can't analyse it .
Turn 660, C (PhD): but eh {disfmarker} If you use a neural net is {disfmarker} is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net .
Turn 661, D (Professor): Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are .
Turn 662, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 663, D (Professor): It 's hard to {disfmarker} w w what you {disfmarker} It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally .
Turn 664, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 665, D (Professor): But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized .
Turn 666, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 667, D (Professor): Um , but {disfmarker}
Turn 668, B (Grad): Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine .
Turn 669, D (Professor): Well , this isn't tru if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you really wonder what different if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Turn 670, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 671, B (Grad): Decision tree .
Turn 672, C (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 673, D (Professor): Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's {disfmarker} he 's not {disfmarker} he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this {disfmarker} he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth ,
Turn 674, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 675, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 676, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 677, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 678, D (Professor): in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what {disfmarker} what uh {disfmarker}
Turn 679, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 680, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 681, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I will include too the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the differential de derivates too .
Turn 682, B (Grad): Deltas ,
Turn 683, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 684, B (Grad): yeah . So .
Turn 685, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I mean , I think the other thing that one {disfmarker} I mean , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least {disfmarker} See what I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} Let me tell you what I would do . I would take just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple .
Turn 686, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 687, D (Professor): OK ? Like {disfmarker} like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it .
Turn 688, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 689, D (Professor): and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots .
Turn 690, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 691, D (Professor): OK , so before you do {disfmarker} build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart .
Turn 692, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 693, D (Professor): That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier .
Turn 694, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 695, D (Professor): And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , {vocalsound} @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ {disfmarker} build a Markov model of some sort uh , or {disfmarker} or else have features that really are based on um on {disfmarker} on some bigger chunk of time .
Turn 696, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 697, B (Grad): Context window ?
Turn 698, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 699, D (Professor): But I think this is a good place to start . But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even {disfmarker} even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know
Turn 700, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 701, D (Professor): what it 's doing , even {disfmarker} You know it 's Uh , I think to know what it 's {disfmarker} to have a better feeling for what it 's
Turn 702, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 703, D (Professor): look at {disfmarker} at som some picture that shows you , " Here 's {disfmarker} These things uh , uh are {disfmarker} offer some separation . " {vocalsound} And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think {disfmarker} is something {vocalsound} like , uh , the residual {disfmarker}
Turn 704, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 705, D (Professor): Um So .
Turn 706, C (PhD): Yeah . S
Turn 707, E (Postdoc): Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me .
Turn 708, C (PhD): Yeah , because {disfmarker} Yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I {disfmarker} Yeah . But eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Is my my {disfmarker} my own vision , {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of the project .
Turn 709, B (Grad): So , some sort of {disfmarker} That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 710, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 711, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} eh the {disfmarker} the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two {vocalsound} eh , w has eh several parts , several p {vocalsound} objective
Turn 712, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 713, C (PhD): eh , because it 's a {disfmarker} a great project . But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think {pause} you eh {disfmarker} we have eh {vocalsound} {pause} two main eh objective . One {disfmarker} one of these is to {disfmarker} eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . And {vocalsound} for that , if you don't use , eh , {vocalsound} eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to {disfmarker} to try to {disfmarker} to {pause} {pause} {vocalsound} to label the different frames , I think {pause} the Ike criterion {pause} or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change .
Turn 714, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 715, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} Probably . {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to t prove . Uh , probably . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or {disfmarker} or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with {disfmarker} {pause} probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the more eh use eh {disfmarker} use eh {disfmarker} used eh em {pause} normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . you {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to find {disfmarker} you can find the {disfmarker} the mark . You can find the {disfmarker} nnn , the {disfmarker} the acoustic change . But eh eh I {disfmarker} I understand that you {disfmarker} your objective is {pause} to eh classify , to know that eh that zone {pause} not is only {comment} a new zone in the {disfmarker} in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to {disfmarker} to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose .
Turn 716, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 717, C (PhD): you {disfmarker} you will pretend {comment} to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm
Turn 718, D (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 719, C (PhD): because it 's very difficult to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to obtain the transcription {pause} from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . That , you know , {pause} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think is the idea . And so {vocalsound} eh the , nnn {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} the system {pause} eh will have two models .
Turn 720, E (Postdoc): Clustering .
Turn 721, C (PhD): A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh , will be possible the , eh {disfmarker} the mark , the change and another {disfmarker} another model will @ @ {pause} or several models , to try s but {disfmarker} eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class .
Turn 722, E (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 723, B (Grad): I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you {disfmarker} what you said . What {disfmarker} what model ?
Turn 724, E (Postdoc): 
Turn 725, C (PhD): Eh , the {disfmarker} the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to {disfmarker} to recognize , eh with eh {disfmarker} to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer .
Turn 726, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 727, C (PhD): And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net
Turn 728, E (Postdoc): So p
Turn 729, C (PhD): with {pause} the {pause} information we obtain from this eh {disfmarker} this eh study of the parameter with the {pause} selected {pause} parameter to try to eh {disfmarker} to put the class of each frame . Eh {pause} for {pause} the difference {pause} zone
Turn 730, B (Grad): Features . Yeah .
Turn 731, C (PhD): you {disfmarker} you eh , eh {pause} have obtained in the first eh , step {pause} with the {pause} for example , BIC eh , eh {pause} criterion compare model
Turn 732, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 733, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You I don't - u
Turn 734, D (Professor): OK , but , I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} in any event we 're agreed that the first step is {disfmarker}
Turn 735, C (PhD): i
Turn 736, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 737, D (Professor): Because what we had before for {disfmarker} for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps .
Turn 738, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 739, D (Professor): So the first thing is for you to {disfmarker} to build up something that will detect the overlaps .
Turn 740, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 741, D (Professor): Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker}
Turn 742, B (Grad): Features ?
Turn 743, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 744, D (Professor): Well , I {disfmarker} again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too {disfmarker} way too big .
Turn 745, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 746, D (Professor): OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth {disfmarker} twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much .
Turn 747, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 748, D (Professor): You won't be able to look at it . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does .
Turn 749, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 750, D (Professor): Whereas I think if you have things {disfmarker} if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , uh , and look at how the {disfmarker} the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on .
Turn 751, C (PhD): It will be enough .
Turn 752, D (Professor): Well , you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know ,
Turn 753, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 754, D (Professor): so if you look at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , {vocalsound} and then you look at the third and there 's not {disfmarker} and not too much there , {vocalsound} you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients ,
Turn 755, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 756, D (Professor): right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than {disfmarker} than {disfmarker} than the other , maybe . Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , {vocalsound} will say how well , uh {vocalsound} the low - order LPC {vocalsound} model 's fitting it , which should be {vocalsound} pretty poorly for two two or more {vocalsound} people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for {disfmarker} for one .
Turn 757, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 758, D (Professor): And so {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} i again , if you take a few of these things that are {disfmarker} are {vocalsound} prob um {comment} {pause} promising features and look at them in pairs , {vocalsound} uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of " OK , I now have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . " And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine .
Turn 759, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 760, A (PhD): I 've got a question .
Turn 761, C (PhD): Yeah . This
Turn 762, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 763, C (PhD): Sorry .
Turn 764, E (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 765, C (PhD): but eh , eh {vocalsound} eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} do that and I would eh like to {disfmarker} to know what eh , your opinion . Eh {vocalsound} all this study in the f in the first moment , I {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} I will pretend to do {comment} with eh eh equalizes speech . The {disfmarker} the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech .
Turn 766, B (Grad): With {disfmarker}
Turn 767, E (Postdoc): With what ? With what ?
Turn 768, B (Grad): Right . Mixed .
Turn 769, C (PhD): the {disfmarker} the mix , mixed speech .
Turn 770, E (Postdoc): " Mixed " . Thank you .
Turn 771, C (PhD): Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is {disfmarker} {comment} {pause} more eh {disfmarker} a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA .
Turn 772, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 773, C (PhD): PDA speech file is eh {disfmarker} it will be eh difficult . I {disfmarker}
Turn 774, E (Postdoc): So it 's messier .
Turn 775, C (PhD): Yeah ,
Turn 776, E (Postdoc): The {disfmarker} the PDA is messier .
Turn 777, C (PhD): fff ! {comment} Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is low .
Turn 778, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 779, B (Grad): Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start .
Turn 780, C (PhD): And , {vocalsound} I don't know {disfmarker}
Turn 781, B (Grad): But .
Turn 782, C (PhD): I don't know eh uh i i that eh the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the result of the {disfmarker} of the study eh with eh {disfmarker} with eh this eh {disfmarker} this speech , the mix speech eh {pause} will work {pause} exactly {pause} with the {pause} eh PDA files .
Turn 783, B (Grad): It would be interesting in itself to see . Well , I think that would be an interesting result .
Turn 784, C (PhD): eh What , I {disfmarker} I mean , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to noise relation , you know , eh with {disfmarker}
Turn 785, D (Professor): N u We Well , I think {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think it 's not a {disfmarker} it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't {disfmarker} aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway .
Turn 786, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 787, D (Professor): And so , if you can get {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features {vocalsound} look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , {comment} {vocalsound} and then collect , uh in pairs , {vocalsound} and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed {vocalsound} with a bigger classifier .
Turn 788, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 789, D (Professor): And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much {disfmarker}
Turn 790, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 791, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 792, D (Professor): And then you can re - optimize , and so on .
Turn 793, B (Grad): Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . Because it {disfmarker} I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and {disfmarker} And don't {disfmarker}
Turn 794, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 795, C (PhD): Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
Turn 796, D (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} well , the {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's true that it also , it could be {vocalsound} useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure .
Turn 797, C (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 798, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 799, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that the {disfmarker} the eh parameter we found , eh , eh {vocalsound} worked with both eh , speech file ,
Turn 800, E (Postdoc): That 's good .
Turn 801, C (PhD): but eh what is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the relation of eh {disfmarker} of the {vocalsound} performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files .
Turn 802, D (Professor): Hmm .
Turn 803, C (PhD): Yeah , I don't know .
Turn 804, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 805, C (PhD): But it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it will be important . Because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . Is {disfmarker} eh is not easy eh to {disfmarker} to solve , because if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I have seen the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is {comment} very difficult because you {disfmarker} you don't see the spectrum {disfmarker} the spectrogram .
Turn 806, B (Grad): Right . Yeah , they 're totally hidden .
Turn 807, C (PhD): Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see .
Turn 808, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . Well , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things {disfmarker} things like harmonicity , and {vocalsound} residual energy are uh , yeah are {disfmarker} are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable .
Turn 809, C (PhD): But I suppose {disfmarker}
Turn 810, B (Grad): Are probably better , yep .
Turn 811, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I will put eh the energy here . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 812, D (Professor): Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess .
Turn 813, C (PhD): You have a question .
Turn 814, A (PhD): Yeah , I {pause} maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA
Turn 815, D (Professor): Nah .
Turn 816, A (PhD): because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ? I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 817, B (Grad): Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one .
Turn 818, A (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 819, D (Professor): Yeah , no , you you 're {disfmarker} you 're right
Turn 820, B (Grad): But that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 821, D (Professor): that {disfmarker} In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and {disfmarker} and so that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 822, A (PhD): Is that not allowed with this project ?
Turn 823, D (Professor): Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really .
Turn 824, A (PhD): But I didn't mean {disfmarker} I w {pause} Given {disfmarker} given the goal .
Turn 825, D (Professor): I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's an additional interesting question .
Turn 826, A (PhD): I mean , is {disfmarker} is that violation of the {disfmarker}
Turn 827, C (PhD): Oh . No . Yeah .
Turn 828, D (Professor): I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two .
Turn 829, A (PhD): Mm - hmm
Turn 830, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 831, D (Professor): Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point .
Turn 832, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 833, D (Professor): But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting {disfmarker} having the ability to detect overlaps is . You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much .
Turn 834, A (PhD): Right . Right . OK .
Turn 835, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 836, D (Professor): So , this is all pretty early stages .
Turn 837, A (PhD): I see .
Turn 838, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 839, D (Professor): But no , you 're absolutely right . That 's {pause} a good thing to consider .
Turn 840, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 841, E (Postdoc): There {disfmarker} there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the {disfmarker} to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ?
Turn 842, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 843, D (Professor): Well , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it does , i it d it does , but the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the issue is that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Turn 844, A (PhD): No , it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not that so much as {disfmarker}
Turn 845, E (Postdoc): And then , And if they 're on the access {disfmarker} {comment} on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking .
Turn 846, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 847, E (Postdoc): He {disfmarker} You mentioned this last time , that {disfmarker} that if {disfmarker} if you 're straight down the midline , then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} the r the left - right 's gonna be different ,
Turn 848, B (Grad): Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable ,
Turn 849, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I th
Turn 850, B (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 851, A (PhD): Well , it 's
Turn 852, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 853, E (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway .
Turn 854, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 855, E (Postdoc): It seems to me that {disfmarker} that it 's not {disfmarker} a p uh , you know , it 's {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the topograph the topology of it is {disfmarker} is a little bit complicated .
Turn 856, B (Grad): But it 's another source of information .
Turn 857, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 858, A (PhD): I don't {disfmarker} I don't know ho
Turn 859, C (PhD): I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} Sorry . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's uh {disfmarker} from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to {disfmarker} to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I {disfmarker} I found difference between the {disfmarker} the speech from {disfmarker} from each micro eh , in the PDA .
Turn 860, A (PhD): I would guess {disfmarker}
Turn 861, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 862, D (Professor): Yeah , it 's timing difference . It - it 's not amplitude ,
Turn 863, E (Postdoc): Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves .
Turn 864, D (Professor): right ? S Right .
Turn 865, E (Postdoc): I mean , I know {disfmarker} I n I know that 's a very important cue .
Turn 866, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 867, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 868, E (Postdoc): But I 'm just {disfmarker} I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each {disfmarker} to each person with respect to the PDA ,
Turn 869, C (PhD): No . No . No , no , no .
Turn 870, E (Postdoc): so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker .
Turn 871, D (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} That 's fine .
Turn 872, A (PhD): But th I don't think that matters , though .
Turn 873, C (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 874, D (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so i @ @ {comment} I think the issue is , " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? "
Turn 875, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 876, D (Professor): If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it {disfmarker} if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,
Turn 877, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 878, D (Professor): wherever they are .
Turn 879, A (PhD): So it 's sort of like how {disfmarker} how confused is it about where the beam is .
Turn 880, D (Professor): Is it a {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}
Turn 881, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 882, D (Professor): Yeah , is there a narrow {disfmarker} Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a {disfmarker} a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh , multiple people .
Turn 883, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 884, D (Professor): Wherever you are , even if he moves around .
Turn 885, E (Postdoc): OK . Yeah . OK , it just {disfmarker} it just seemed to me that {disfmarker} uh , that this isn't the ideal type of separation . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} I can see the value o
Turn 886, D (Professor): Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But the thing is just having two mikes {disfmarker} If you looked at that thing on {disfmarker} on Dan 's page , it was {disfmarker} When {disfmarker} when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different .
Turn 887, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 888, E (Postdoc): Yeah , OK .
Turn 889, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 890, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 891, E (Postdoc): Oh yeah yeah . OK .
Turn 892, A (PhD): What looked different ?
Turn 893, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 894, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 895, D (Professor): Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation .
Turn 896, B (Grad): Cross - co cross - correlation .
Turn 897, C (PhD): Correlation , yeah .
Turn 898, D (Professor): Just cross - correlation between two sides .
Turn 899, A (PhD): Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two {disfmarker}
Turn 900, D (Professor): So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive .
Turn 901, E (Postdoc): Uh , his a web page .
Turn 902, D (Professor): You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags .
Turn 903, B (Grad): Subtract them .
Turn 904, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 905, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 906, A (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 907, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 908, B (Grad): And you find {disfmarker} They get peaks .
Turn 909, D (Professor): OK . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , {vocalsound} then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in {disfmarker} in the lag .
Turn 910, A (PhD): OK . OK .
Turn 911, D (Professor): So if {disfmarker} at whatever angle you are , {vocalsound} at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the cross - correlation value {disfmarker} function .
Turn 912, A (PhD): So {disfmarker} so if there 's two {disfmarker}
Turn 913, B (Grad): And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks .
Turn 914, D (Professor): It 's spread out .
Turn 915, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 916, E (Postdoc): Well , let me ask you , if {disfmarker} if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ?
Turn 917, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 918, D (Professor): Yeah . The - the {disfmarker} Oh , I 'm sorry ,
Turn 919, E (Postdoc): No ?
Turn 920, D (Professor): if they 're right next to one another ?
Turn 921, A (PhD): If I was {disfmarker} if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work .
Turn 922, D (Professor): i i
Turn 923, E (Postdoc): Next {disfmarker} next one over n over {comment} on this side of the P {disfmarker} PDA .
Turn 924, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 925, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 926, E (Postdoc): There we go . Good example , the same one I 'm asking .
Turn 927, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 928, D (Professor): Yeah , e I see .
Turn 929, A (PhD): Yes .
Turn 930, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 931, E (Postdoc): Versus you {disfmarker} versus {disfmarker} you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one .
Turn 932, B (Grad): Or {disfmarker} or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either .
Turn 933, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 934, D (Professor): Yeah . Oh , yeah .
Turn 935, E (Postdoc): It seems like that would be pretty strong .
Turn 936, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 937, E (Postdoc): Across {disfmarker} the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate .
Turn 938, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 939, D (Professor): Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 940, E (Postdoc): And so my point was just that it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be differentially {disfmarker} differentially varia valuable .
Turn 941, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 942, E (Postdoc): I mean , it 's not to say {disfmarker} I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val {comment} And we {disfmarker} we humans {pause} n n depend on {pause} you know , these {disfmarker} these binaural cues .
Turn 943, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 944, D (Professor): But it 's almost {disfmarker} but it 's almost a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things .
Turn 945, E (Postdoc): But .
Turn 946, B (Grad): Must do . {comment} Yeah .
Turn 947, D (Professor): There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue . So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error .
Turn 948, E (Postdoc): Yes . Yeah .
Turn 949, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 950, D (Professor): If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it .
Turn 951, E (Postdoc): OK . and i and if there {disfmarker} So it {disfmarker} And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side {disfmarker}
Turn 952, D (Professor): Uh , if they 're {disfmarker} if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity .
Turn 953, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 954, D (Professor): So if the sensitivity is good enough {disfmarker} and we just {disfmarker} we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how {disfmarker}
Turn 955, E (Postdoc): Yeah . OK . Yeah yeah , OK . Yeah .
Turn 956, B (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 957, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 958, E (Postdoc): Oh I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that {disfmarker} that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody .
Turn 959, D (Professor): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 960, B (Grad): And I think Dan is still working on it . So . He actually {disfmarker} he wrote me about it a little bit , so .
Turn 961, E (Postdoc): Great . No , I don't mean to discourage that at all .
Turn 962, D (Professor): I mean , the other thing you can do {disfmarker} uh , if {disfmarker} I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody {disfmarker} convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . But if you h put a third in , {vocalsound} you could put in the other axis . And then you know {disfmarker} then you 're sort of {disfmarker} Yeah , then {disfmarker} then you pretty much could cover {disfmarker}
Turn 963, A (PhD): Once you got two {disfmarker}
Turn 964, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 965, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 966, A (PhD): Well what about just doing it from these mikes ?
Turn 967, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 968, A (PhD): You know ?
Turn 969, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 970, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 971, C (PhD): It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the separation {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Turn 972, D (Professor): Uh @ @ {comment} {vocalsound} But - but that 's {disfmarker} I mean , we can we 'll be {disfmarker} all of this is there for us to study .
Turn 973, B (Grad): Then they 're much broader . Yeah , we can do whatever we want .
Turn 974, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 975, D (Professor): But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} but the thing is , uh , one of the {disfmarker} at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA .
Turn 976, B (Grad): Whatever you 're interested in .
Turn 977, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 978, A (PhD): That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ?
Turn 979, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 980, D (Professor): Right . Yeah .
Turn 981, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 982, D (Professor): Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were {disfmarker} were {disfmarker} were interested in .
Turn 983, B (Grad): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 984, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 985, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 986, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 987, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 988, D (Professor): Uh , but {disfmarker} you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} uh , yeah , at Brown and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} at uh {pause} um and at Cape ,
Turn 989, B (Grad): Big micro @ @ arrays .
Turn 990, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 991, A (PhD): Didn't they have something at Cape ?
Turn 992, D (Professor): they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place
Turn 993, B (Grad): Very finely .
Turn 994, D (Professor): uh , you know p tens of microphones , and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker}
Turn 995, A (PhD): Oh ! I saw a demo .
Turn 996, C (PhD): Oh , right , oh , yeah .
Turn 997, D (Professor): And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity {disfmarker}
Turn 998, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 999, B (Grad): Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array .
Turn 1000, D (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1001, A (PhD): And you could {disfmarker} In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody .
Turn 1002, C (PhD): Hundred .
Turn 1003, B (Grad): And they had very precision .
Turn 1004, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1005, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 1006, C (PhD): Very complex , uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 1007, D (Professor): Ye - Pretty much . Yeah .
Turn 1008, B (Grad): It was all in software and they {disfmarker} and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it .
Turn 1009, A (PhD): That is cool .
Turn 1010, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1011, B (Grad): It was {disfmarker} yeah , it was interesting .
Turn 1012, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1013, D (Professor): But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , " well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up " .
Turn 1014, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1015, A (PhD): No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall .
Turn 1016, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1017, A (PhD): It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA .
Turn 1018, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 1019, B (Grad): But I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1020, D (Professor): The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D
Turn 1021, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1022, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1023, D (Professor): and they communicate with each other ? And then {disfmarker} You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that {disfmarker} I mean , basically there wouldn't be any {disfmarker} l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . If you had three or four it 's {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 1024, A (PhD): Ooo !
Turn 1025, B (Grad): That 's on my web pages .
Turn 1026, A (PhD): Network !
Turn 1027, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1028, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 1029, B (Grad): Though {disfmarker} All sorts of interesting things you can do with that ,
Turn 1030, E (Postdoc): Interesting .
Turn 1031, B (Grad): I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well .
Turn 1032, E (Postdoc): Hmm .
Turn 1033, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1034, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1035, B (Grad): So it 's {disfmarker} it would be neat .
Turn 1036, E (Postdoc): Ah !
Turn 1037, A (PhD): I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then {disfmarker}
Turn 1038, B (Grad): But {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1039, E (Postdoc): Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing .
Turn 1040, B (Grad): in terms of {disfmarker}
Turn 1041, A (PhD): Yeah !
Turn 1042, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1043, A (PhD): Hats ?
Turn 1044, B (Grad): In terms of the research {pause} th research , it 's really {disfmarker} it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .
Turn 1045, A (PhD): Shirts .
Turn 1046, B (Grad): So if {disfmarker} if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . But if {disfmarker} if he 's not , that 's great too .
Turn 1047, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1048, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1049, D (Professor): Yeah . Um , I {disfmarker} i I {disfmarker} i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there .
Turn 1050, B (Grad): Catch some tea ? Um .
Turn 1051, D (Professor): So
Turn 1052, B (Grad): Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out .
Turn 1053, D (Professor): OK .
Turn 1054, B (Grad): One is , do we need to sign new {disfmarker} these again ?
Turn 1055, E (Postdoc): Well , it 's slightly different . So I {disfmarker} I would say it would be a good idea .
Turn 1056, A (PhD): Are they new ?
Turn 1057, E (Postdoc): Cuz {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's slightly different .
Turn 1058, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1059, A (PhD): Oh .
Turn 1060, D (Professor): Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to .
Turn 1061, B (Grad): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed .
Turn 1062, E (Postdoc): It 's slightly different .
Turn 1063, B (Grad): So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .
Turn 1064, D (Professor): Ah - oh .
Turn 1065, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1066, B (Grad): Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing .
Turn 1067, E (Postdoc): I had to make one {disfmarker}
Turn 1068, B (Grad): But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . Uh .
Turn 1069, E (Postdoc): Well , should I {disfmarker} I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like um the anonymization is uh , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .
Turn 1070, D (Professor): Um . I mean , wha what {disfmarker}
Turn 1071, E (Postdoc): If {disfmarker} if we 're about to wind down , I think {disfmarker} what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps .
Turn 1072, A (PhD): We still have to do this , too , right ?
Turn 1073, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 1074, A (PhD): Digits ?
Turn 1075, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 1076, B (Grad): No - well , we don't have to do digits .
Turn 1077, D (Professor): Well , why don't we {disfmarker} Uh , so @ @ OK . @ @ {comment} It sounds like u uh , there were {disfmarker} there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to {disfmarker} to briefly {comment} do them , and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then we {disfmarker}
Turn 1078, B (Grad): OK , go ahead , Jane .
Turn 1079, E (Postdoc): I 'd {disfmarker} Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e Could I do that next week maybe ?
Turn 1080, D (Professor): OK . Oh , yeah . Sure .
Turn 1081, E (Postdoc): OK , that 's what I 'm asking .
Turn 1082, D (Professor): Oh yeah , yeah .
Turn 1083, E (Postdoc): And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's {disfmarker} that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a {disfmarker} you know , more that just a minute .
Turn 1084, D (Professor): We could s
Turn 1085, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1086, E (Postdoc): I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should {disfmarker}
Turn 1087, B (Grad): Alright . We 're {disfmarker} we 're just {disfmarker} We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with {disfmarker} once we decide how to do it
Turn 1088, E (Postdoc): Well , OK .
Turn 1089, B (Grad): going and dealing with it .
Turn 1090, E (Postdoc): It 's just {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . I {disfmarker} I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes .
Turn 1091, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1092, E (Postdoc): OK , so {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . Those we won't be able to change . If someone says " Hey , Roger so - and - so " .
Turn 1093, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 1094, E (Postdoc): So that 's gonna stay that person 's name .
Turn 1095, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1096, E (Postdoc): Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says " Hey Roger " or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ?
Turn 1097, B (Grad): No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping .
Turn 1098, E (Postdoc): OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .
Turn 1099, A (PhD): I don't {disfmarker}
Turn 1100, B (Grad): No . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want {disfmarker}
Turn 1101, E (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I don't think you understood what I {disfmarker} what I said .
Turn 1102, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 1103, E (Postdoc): So {disfmarker} uh , so in {disfmarker} within the context of an utterance , someone says " So , Roger , what do you think ? " OK . Then , uh , it seems to me that {disfmarker} Well , maybe I {disfmarker} uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that .
Turn 1104, A (PhD): Right , you don't wanna do that .
Turn 1105, B (Grad): We don't {disfmarker} we wanna {disfmarker} we ha we want the transcript to be " Roger " .
Turn 1106, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1107, B (Grad): Because if we made the {disfmarker} the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that .
Turn 1108, E (Postdoc): OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then {disfmarker} and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's {disfmarker} who 's the addressee and all , then to have " Roger " be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was " Roger " be " Frank " , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .
Turn 1109, B (Grad): Oh . Ugh ! That 's a good point .
Turn 1110, E (Postdoc): Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except
Turn 1111, D (Professor): Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that .
Turn 1112, E (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} cer and I {disfmarker} So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back . Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to {disfmarker} they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like {disfmarker} {comment} OK . So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . On the other hand , this is a small {disfmarker} this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the {disfmarker} from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names .
Turn 1113, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 1114, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 1115, E (Postdoc): So , is it really , um {disfmarker} {comment} You know ?
Turn 1116, B (Grad): Ugh !
Turn 1117, E (Postdoc): Now , in terms of like {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name .
Turn 1118, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1119, E (Postdoc): Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise . You don't wanna mention subjects by name in published reports . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a {disfmarker} in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked {disfmarker}
Turn 1120, D (Professor): You can go , you know , uh , " Z " {vocalsound} uh , for instance .
Turn 1121, E (Postdoc): Yeah , exactly . Doesn't matter if {disfmarker}
Turn 1122, D (Professor): Uh . Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the transcript .
Turn 1123, E (Postdoc): That 's the same thing you saw .
Turn 1124, B (Grad): OK . 
Turn 1125, D (Professor): Uh , I think {disfmarker} you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , listed .
Turn 1126, E (Postdoc): Yeah , and {disfmarker} and in the form that they sign , it does say " your first name may arise in the course of the meetings " .
Turn 1127, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1128, D (Professor): And so {disfmarker}
Turn 1129, A (PhD): Well {disfmarker}
Turn 1130, D (Professor): Yeah . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , " Frank said this " and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's " Frank colon " .
Turn 1131, E (Postdoc): Or " your name " .
Turn 1132, B (Grad): Yeah , shoot !
Turn 1133, D (Professor): Right ?
Turn 1134, E (Postdoc): Yeah , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh {disfmarker} Well , it just seems like to track {disfmarker} track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important .
Turn 1135, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1136, E (Postdoc): S i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who " you " was .
Turn 1137, B (Grad): Shoot !
Turn 1138, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1139, B (Grad): I {disfmarker} I 'm thinking too much .
Turn 1140, E (Postdoc): And ac {comment} and actually you remember {disfmarker} furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names ,
Turn 1141, D (Professor): Yeah , I was too . Yeah .
Turn 1142, E (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and it was {disfmarker} and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse .
Turn 1143, B (Grad): Yep . Well , I would sug I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} don't wanna change the names in the transcript ,
Turn 1144, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1145, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1146, B (Grad): but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point .
Turn 1147, E (Postdoc): Misleading .
Turn 1148, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1149, B (Grad): You 're right , this is going to require more thought .
Turn 1150, D (Professor): Yeah . L let me just back up this to make a {disfmarker} a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh {disfmarker} I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . Uh , and so , uh {disfmarker} and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll mention this to {disfmarker} to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any {disfmarker} any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into {disfmarker} into the agenda ,
Turn 1151, E (Postdoc): OK . Sure .
Turn 1152, D (Professor): but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else {vocalsound} completely make up the agenda . I 've no desire to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to make it up , but if {disfmarker} if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my {disfmarker} my guesses , and {disfmarker} and uh , and i ye yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and so it 's {disfmarker} {pause} There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on .
Turn 1153, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1154, E (Postdoc): Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah . I just {disfmarker} I just couldn't do it in two minutes .
Turn 1155, B (Grad): How will we {disfmarker} how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ?
Turn 1156, A (PhD): " The person who 's doing the transcript {disfmarker} " {comment} The IBM people ?
Turn 1157, B (Grad): Yeah . I mean , so so {disfmarker} how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ?
Turn 1158, E (Postdoc): How do you mean , who {disfmarker} what they 're {disfmarker} who they 're talking about ?
Turn 1159, B (Grad): I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted {disfmarker} wanted to do so - and - so " ,
Turn 1160, E (Postdoc): How do you mean ?
Turn 1161, A (PhD): They 're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do @ @ {disfmarker}
Turn 1162, B (Grad): if you 're doing {disfmarker} Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write " Bob " . And so . If you 're {disfmarker} if you 're doing discourse analysis ,
Turn 1163, E (Postdoc): They won't be able to change it themselves .
Turn 1164, D (Professor): What ar how are they gonna do any of this ?
Turn 1165, B (Grad): Yeah , really .
Turn 1166, E (Postdoc): Well , I {disfmarker} I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them .
Turn 1167, D (Professor): I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Turn 1168, A (PhD): They can't do that .
Turn 1169, C (PhD): Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1170, B (Grad): Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity .
Turn 1171, C (PhD): 
Turn 1172, B (Grad): because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions .
Turn 1173, D (Professor): So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words .
Turn 1174, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1175, E (Postdoc): Oh . {vocalsound} I think that {disfmarker} My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ?
Turn 1176, D (Professor): Uh {pause} Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah .
Turn 1177, E (Postdoc): Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ?
Turn 1178, B (Grad): y Yu - Ching .
Turn 1179, E (Postdoc): was that um , they will {disfmarker} that they will adopt the {disfmarker} part of the conventions that {disfmarker} that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's {disfmarker} Well , they 'll {disfmarker} they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them {disfmarker} So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of {disfmarker} of their labeling the speakers . We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case .
Turn 1180, D (Professor): And it {disfmarker} and it may very well be {disfmarker} I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the {disfmarker} eh the {disfmarker} the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two .
Turn 1181, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1182, D (Professor): And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one .
Turn 1183, E (Postdoc): You know {disfmarker} Uh - huh . You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part .
Turn 1184, C (PhD): Yeah . It 's a good idea .
Turn 1185, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1186, E (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but then we would need to label it .
Turn 1187, B (Grad): Yeah we {disfmarker} we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes .
Turn 1188, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Turn 1189, E (Postdoc): And that 's OK .
Turn 1190, C (PhD): 
Turn 1191, E (Postdoc): Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes .
Turn 1192, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1193, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1194, B (Grad): So . But I mean that doesn't {disfmarker} This doesn't answer the {disfmarker} the question .
Turn 1195, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1196, D (Professor): But that {disfmarker}
Turn 1197, E (Postdoc): That 'd be very efficient .
Turn 1198, B (Grad): The p It 's a good point , " which {disfmarker} what do you do for discourse tracking ? "
Turn 1199, C (PhD): Because y y you don't know to know , eh {disfmarker} you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the {disfmarker} of the speakers . You only eh want to know {disfmarker}
Turn 1200, B (Grad): Hmm . For {disfmarker} for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do .
Turn 1201, D (Professor): Well , you do .
Turn 1202, C (PhD): Ah , for discourse , yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1203, D (Professor): Yeah . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if someone says , uh , " what {disfmarker} what is Jose doing ? " and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding .
Turn 1204, C (PhD): Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah ,
Turn 1205, B (Grad): Ugh , {comment} that 's a problem .
Turn 1206, D (Professor): Uh , so .
Turn 1207, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1208, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1209, E (Postdoc): Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit .
Turn 1210, A (PhD): That would be hard .
Turn 1211, E (Postdoc): Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @ {comment} uh , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and {disfmarker} and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was {disfmarker} was unable to do the tracking .
Turn 1212, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1213, E (Postdoc): But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . So , people are really flexible .
Turn 1214, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1215, A (PhD): But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting {disfmarker} Or , you I think said , {pause} you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , " is Mari gonna use the equipment ? " I mean , how would you say that ?
Turn 1216, E (Postdoc): Yeah ?
Turn 1217, A (PhD): I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef
Turn 1218, B (Grad): if you wanted to anonymize .
Turn 1219, C (PhD): Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , is {disfmarker}
Turn 1220, D (Professor): " Is you know who up in you know where ? "
Turn 1221, A (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1222, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1223, D (Professor): Right ? Use the {disfmarker}
Turn 1224, A (PhD): I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else .
Turn 1225, B (Grad): Yeah , darn ! I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names .
Turn 1226, E (Postdoc): Well , it
Turn 1227, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1228, B (Grad): but then , again that kills your discourse analysis .
Turn 1229, A (PhD): Right .
Turn 1230, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 1231, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1232, B (Grad): Ugh !
Turn 1233, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1234, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1235, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1236, A (PhD): I {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all .
Turn 1237, E (Postdoc): That 's {disfmarker} that 's the issue .
Turn 1238, B (Grad): Well , but that but that {disfmarker} as I said , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that works great for the acoustics , but it {disfmarker} it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse .
Turn 1239, E (Postdoc): Well .
Turn 1240, A (PhD): Why ?
Turn 1241, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1242, B (Grad): Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus {pause} their {pause} name that they 're being referred to .
Turn 1243, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1244, D (Professor): Yeah . Th - Bec
Turn 1245, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1246, A (PhD): I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two {disfmarker}
Turn 1247, B (Grad): Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and {disfmarker}
Turn 1248, A (PhD): Why do you have to know his name ?
Turn 1249, D (Professor): OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what {disfmarker} uh , what Jose said . "
Turn 1250, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1251, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1252, D (Professor): And then , Jose responds .
Turn 1253, A (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1254, D (Professor): And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " .
Turn 1255, A (PhD): OK .
Turn 1256, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1257, D (Professor): So {pause} uh {pause} u
Turn 1258, A (PhD): Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word " Jose " in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded .
Turn 1259, D (Professor): Right .
Turn 1260, B (Grad): Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that .
Turn 1261, D (Professor): And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says " speaker - five " there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose ,
Turn 1262, B (Grad): And that violates our privacy .
Turn 1263, D (Professor): and if were gonna do that we might as well {comment} give them " Jose " {disfmarker} say it was " Jose " .
Turn 1264, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 1265, B (Grad): And that violates our privacy issue .
Turn 1266, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1267, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 1268, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1269, E (Postdoc): Now , I {disfmarker} I think that we have these two phases in the {disfmarker} in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI .
Turn 1270, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1271, E (Postdoc): And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the {disfmarker} to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to .
Turn 1272, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1273, E (Postdoc): And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I {disfmarker} but I don that 's {disfmarker} that 's a long way from now and {disfmarker} and it 's a matter of {disfmarker} between now and then of d of deciding how {disfmarker}
Turn 1274, B (Grad): Making some decisions ?
Turn 1275, E (Postdoc): i i it {disfmarker} You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um {disfmarker} the audio , and just put in brackets " speaker - one " .
Turn 1276, B (Grad): Yeah . For the public one .
Turn 1277, C (PhD): the ? ?
Turn 1278, B (Grad): You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release .
Turn 1279, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1280, E (Postdoc): You know .
Turn 1281, B (Grad): One that 's public and one {disfmarker} one that requires licensing . And so the licensed one would {disfmarker} w we could {disfmarker} it would be a sticky limitation .
Turn 1282, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 1283, B (Grad): You know , like {disfmarker} Well , we can talk about that later .
Turn 1284, E (Postdoc): I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same . I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same .
Turn 1285, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I agree . I {disfmarker} I agree with Jane .
Turn 1286, E (Postdoc): For a bunch of reasons , legal .
Turn 1287, D (Professor): I {disfmarker} I think that we {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and {disfmarker}
Turn 1288, E (Postdoc): But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important .
Turn 1289, A (PhD): Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um {disfmarker} For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse .
Turn 1290, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 1291, A (PhD): If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 1292, B (Grad): Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to {pause} still have it useful . because for discourse you don't need the audio . Right ? So you could bleep out the names in the audio .
Turn 1293, A (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1294, B (Grad): and use the anonymized one through the transcript .
Turn 1295, A (PhD): But if you release both {disfmarker}
Turn 1296, D (Professor): Uh .
Turn 1297, E (Postdoc): Excuse me . We {disfmarker} we do need audio for discourse .
Turn 1298, B (Grad): But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names .
Turn 1299, D (Professor): She {disfmarker} No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said " Jose " in their {disfmarker} in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it .
Turn 1300, B (Grad): Right . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " that you could replace it with " speaker - seven " .
Turn 1301, D (Professor): Oh I see . I see .
Turn 1302, E (Postdoc): Yeah . But I {disfmarker} {pause} I also wanna say that people {disfmarker}
Turn 1303, B (Grad): And then it wouldn't meet {disfmarker} match the audio anymore . But it would be still useful for the {disfmarker}
Turn 1304, E (Postdoc): Uh - huh .
Turn 1305, A (PhD): But if both of those are publically available {disfmarker}
Turn 1306, E (Postdoc): Yeah . That 's good .
Turn 1307, B (Grad): But they {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 1308, D (Professor): And th and the other thing is if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if Liz were here , {vocalsound} what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue ,
Turn 1309, E (Postdoc): Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated .
Turn 1310, D (Professor): and so , {vocalsound} uh ,
Turn 1311, E (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 1312, D (Professor): yeah . Sorry .
Turn 1313, E (Postdoc): I think we have to think about w @ @ {comment} how . I think that this can't be decided today .
Turn 1314, B (Grad): Yeah , OK , good point .
Turn 1315, E (Postdoc): But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time .
Turn 1316, D (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1317, B (Grad): I didn't think {disfmarker} when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is .
Turn 1318, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1319, D (Professor): OK . Yeah , a lot of these things are .
Turn 1320, B (Grad): Discourse .
Turn 1321, E (Postdoc): Well it {disfmarker} Discourse , you know {disfmarker} Also I wanted to make the point that {disfmarker} that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript .
Turn 1322, B (Grad): Yeah , ab absolutely . Oh , yeah , sure .
Turn 1323, E (Postdoc): It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this {disfmarker} confronting this problem .
Turn 1324, A (PhD): Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse ,
Turn 1325, E (Postdoc): So .
Turn 1326, A (PhD): and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it .
Turn 1327, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1328, E (Postdoc): Yeah , we should just market it to non - English speaking countries .
Turn 1329, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 1330, D (Professor): Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name .
Turn 1331, B (Grad): Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ?
Turn 1332, E (Postdoc): We could have little labels . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like " Mister White " , " Mister Pink " , {vocalsound} " Mister Blue " .
Turn 1333, A (PhD): Mister White .
Turn 1334, B (Grad): Yeah . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards .
Turn 1335, A (PhD): But {disfmarker} so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous
Turn 1336, B (Grad): Everything was in the same order , but they were {disfmarker} the individual syll {comment} syllables were played backwards . And you could listen to it , {pause} and it would sound the same .
Turn 1337, A (PhD): What did it sound like ?
Turn 1338, B (Grad): People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it .
Turn 1339, D (Professor): Oh , well that 's {disfmarker} there 's an easy way to do that . Jus - jus just play it all backwards .
Turn 1340, B (Grad): Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it .
Turn 1341, D (Professor): What , what does the speech recognizer care ?
Turn 1342, B (Grad): Ah , anyway .
Turn 1343, D (Professor): Um ,
Turn 1344, E (Postdoc): Oh , do we do digits ? Or {disfmarker} ? What do we do ?
Turn 1345, B (Grad): Uh {disfmarker} OK , we 'll quickly do digits .
Turn 1346, D (Professor): Let 's do digits . Yeah , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we already missed the party .
Turn 1347, E (Postdoc): Or do we just quit ?
Turn 1348, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 1349, D (Professor): So .
Turn 1350, E (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 1351, B (Grad): OK , go off here .
Turn 1352, A (PhD): I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations . like as if you were talking like , " nine eight six eight seven ? "
Turn 1353, E (Postdoc): Well , you know , in the {disfmarker} in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances {disfmarker} {pause} I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a {disfmarker} li So it was like " nine eight two four , nine nine two four " .
Turn 1354, A (PhD): Oh , really . So they were like looking ahead ,
Turn 1355, E (Postdoc): And {disfmarker}
Turn 1356, A (PhD): huh ?
Turn 1357, E (Postdoc): Well , they differed . I mean , at that {disfmarker} that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences . But , um , sometimes people do it as phone numbers . {comment} I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I {pause} am sort of interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} And sometimes , you know , I s And I {disfmarker} I never know . When I do it , I {disfmarker} I ask myself what I 'm doing each time .
Turn 1358, A (PhD): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1359, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 1360, A (PhD): Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this
Turn 1361, E (Postdoc): and I {disfmarker}
Turn 1362, A (PhD): They may as well throw in some interesting intonations .
Turn 1363, B (Grad): Well , except ,
Turn 1364, E (Postdoc): I like your question intonation .
Turn 1365, B (Grad): yeah .
Turn 1366, E (Postdoc): That 's very funny . I haven't heard that one .
Turn 1367, B (Grad): We have the transcript . We have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that . OK , I 'm gonna go off .
