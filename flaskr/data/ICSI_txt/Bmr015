Turn 0, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 1, B (Grad): OK we 're on and we seem to be working .
Turn 2, C (PhD): Yes .
Turn 3, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 4, B (Grad): We didn't crash {disfmarker} we 're not crashing anymore
Turn 5, C (PhD): One , two , three , four , f
Turn 6, B (Grad): and it really bothers me .
Turn 7, A (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 8, C (PhD): No crashing .
Turn 9, G (PhD): I do . I crashed when I started this morning .
Turn 10, B (Grad): You crashed {disfmarker} crashed this morning ? I did not crash this morning .
Turn 11, C (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 12, A (Professor): Oh ! Well maybe it 's just , you know , how many t u u u u how many times you crash in a day .
Turn 13, G (PhD): Really ? Yeah . Maybe , yeah .
Turn 14, A (Professor): First time {disfmarker} first time in the day , you know .
Turn 15, G (PhD): Or maybe it 's once you 've {pause} done enough meetings {comment} it won't crash on you anymore .
Turn 16, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 17, C (PhD): No ?
Turn 18, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 19, G (PhD): It 's a matter of experience .
Turn 20, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 21, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 22, F (Postdoc): Self - learning , yeah .
Turn 23, A (Professor): That 's {disfmarker} that 's great .
Turn 24, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 25, A (Professor): Uh .
Turn 26, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 27, A (Professor): Do we have an agenda ? Liz {disfmarker} Liz and Andreas can't sh can't {disfmarker} uh , can't come .
Turn 28, B (Grad): I do .
Turn 29, A (Professor): So , they won't be here .
Turn 30, B (Grad): I have agenda and it 's all me .
Turn 31, G (PhD): Did {disfmarker}
Turn 32, B (Grad): Cuz no one sent me anything else .
Turn 33, G (PhD): Did they send , uh , the messages to you about the meeting today ?
Turn 34, B (Grad): I have no idea but I just got it a few minutes ago .
Turn 35, G (PhD): Oh .
Turn 36, B (Grad): Right when you were in my office it arrived .
Turn 37, G (PhD): Oh . OK , cuz I checked my mail . I didn't have anything .
Turn 38, B (Grad): So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits .
Turn 39, A (Professor): Uh , right , so {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR .
Turn 40, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 41, B (Grad): Oh , great .
Turn 42, A (Professor): Uh , and then , you have {disfmarker}
Turn 43, F (Postdoc): Can w
Turn 44, A (Professor): I mean , I won't say much , but {disfmarker} {comment} uh , but then , uh , you said {disfmarker} wanna talk about digits ?
Turn 45, B (Grad): I have a short thing about digits and then uh I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions , although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it . So maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who {disfmarker} for whom it 's relevant .
Turn 46, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 47, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 48, F (Postdoc): I could always say something about transcription . I 've been {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} uh , well {disfmarker}
Turn 49, A (Professor): Well if we {disfmarker} Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in . I 'm actually pretty busy today ,
Turn 50, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 51, A (Professor): so if we can {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} we {disfmarker}
Turn 52, F (Postdoc): Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 53, A (Professor): a short meeting would be fine .
Turn 54, F (Postdoc): This does sound like we 're doing fine , yeah . That won't do .
Turn 55, B (Grad): So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read . So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . So I wa Uh . Two things . The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? My opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . You know , the grouping is completely random ,
Turn 56, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 57, B (Grad): so it {disfmarker} it 's perfectly fine to put a {disfmarker} a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set .
Turn 58, F (Postdoc): Oh ! By {disfmarker} throw them out completely ?
Turn 59, B (Grad): Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . So those are {disfmarker} those are the two options .
Turn 60, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 61, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 62, A (Professor): But there 's often things where people do false starts . I know I 've done it , where I say {disfmarker} say a {disfmarker}
Turn 63, B (Grad): What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , {comment} you extract the right string .
Turn 64, G (PhD): Oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ?
Turn 65, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 66, B (Grad): Yeah . And didn't notice . Which happens in a few places .
Turn 67, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 68, G (PhD): Ah .
Turn 69, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 70, B (Grad): So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Turn 71, F (Postdoc): Well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ?
Turn 72, B (Grad): Correct .
Turn 73, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 74, F (Postdoc): I get it .
Turn 75, B (Grad): And so the {disfmarker} the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then {disfmarker} but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore . I don't think that really matters because the conditions are so different . And that would be a little easier .
Turn 76, G (PhD): Well how many are {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how often does that happen ?
Turn 77, B (Grad): Mmm , five or six times .
Turn 78, G (PhD): Oh , so it 's not very much .
Turn 79, B (Grad): No , it 's not much at all .
Turn 80, G (PhD): Seems like we should just change the transcripts
Turn 81, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 82, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 83, G (PhD): to match .
Turn 84, A (Professor): Yeah , it 's five or six times out of {pause} thousands ?
Turn 85, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 86, B (Grad): Four thousand .
Turn 87, A (Professor): Four thousand ?
Turn 88, C (PhD): Four thous Ah ! Four thousand .
Turn 89, G (PhD): Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 90, A (Professor): Yeah , I would , uh , {vocalsound} tak do the easy way ,
Turn 91, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 92, A (Professor): yeah .
Turn 93, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 94, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 95, A (Professor): It {disfmarker} it 's kinda nice {disfmarker} I mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on {disfmarker} on speaker - dependent things
Turn 96, C (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 97, A (Professor): and so I think having {disfmarker} having it all {disfmarker}
Turn 98, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 99, A (Professor): the speakers who we had is {disfmarker} is at least interesting .
Turn 100, G (PhD): So you {disfmarker} um , how many digits have been transcribed now ?
Turn 101, B (Grad): Four thousand lines . And each line is between one and about ten digits .
Turn 102, G (PhD): Four thousand lines ?
Turn 103, B (Grad): I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't compute the average . I think the average was around four or five .
Turn 104, A (Professor): So that 's a couple hours of {disfmarker} of , uh , speech , probably .
Turn 105, G (PhD): Wow .
Turn 106, B (Grad): Yep . Yep .
Turn 107, A (Professor): Which is a yeah reasonable {disfmarker} reasonable test set .
Turn 108, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 109, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 110, B (Grad): And , Jane , I do have a set of forms which I think you have copies of somewhere .
Turn 111, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Yeah , true .
Turn 112, B (Grad): Oh you do ? Oh OK , good , good .
Turn 113, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 114, B (Grad): Yeah , I was just wond I thought I had {disfmarker} had all of them back from you . And then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz
Turn 115, F (Postdoc): No , not yet .
Turn 116, B (Grad): because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits . And so , uh , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions
Turn 117, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . 
Turn 118, E (PhD): Eight eight two two two nine .
Turn 119, B (Grad): and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it .
Turn 120, A (Professor): I see . And the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the {disfmarker} the numerics .
Turn 121, B (Grad): Uh , yes , although we could switch it back . The problem was O and zero . Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say " zero " or always to say " O " .
Turn 122, F (Postdoc): Oh {disfmarker}
Turn 123, A (Professor): Or neither .
Turn 124, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 125, A (Professor): But it 's just two thing {disfmarker} ways that you can say it .
Turn 126, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 127, A (Professor): Right ?
Turn 128, B (Grad): Sure .
Turn 129, F (Postdoc): Oh .
Turn 130, A (Professor): Um {disfmarker} um ,
Turn 131, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 132, A (Professor): that 's the only thought I have because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr She 's trying to get at natural groupings , but it {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way .
Turn 133, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 134, A (Professor): I mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way .
Turn 135, B (Grad): The {disfmarker} the problem also is she did want to stick with digits . I mean I 'm speaking for her since she 's not here .
Turn 136, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 137, B (Grad): But , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , {comment} they might say forty - three instead of four three .
Turn 138, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 139, G (PhD): Mmm .
Turn 140, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 141, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 142, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 143, F (Postdoc): Well , if there 's space , though , between them . I mean , you can {disfmarker} With {disfmarker} when you space them out they don't look like , uh , forty - three anymore .
Turn 144, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 145, B (Grad): Well , she and I were talking about it ,
Turn 146, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 147, B (Grad): and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking .
Turn 148, A (Professor): She 's right . It 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a different problem . I mean it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's an interesting problem {disfmarker} I mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before , and yeah sometimes people {disfmarker} If you say s " three nine eight one " sometimes people will say " thirty - nine eighty - one " or " three hundred {disfmarker} three hundred eighty - nine one " , or {disfmarker} I don't think they 'd say that ,
Turn 149, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 150, A (Professor): but {disfmarker} but th
Turn 151, B (Grad): Not very frequently
Turn 152, A (Professor): no {disfmarker}
Turn 153, B (Grad): but , {vocalsound} they certainly could .
Turn 154, A (Professor): But {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it .
Turn 155, B (Grad): So . I mean , this is something that Liz and I spoke about
Turn 156, A (Professor): But {disfmarker} I see .
Turn 157, B (Grad): and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her .
Turn 158, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 159, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 160, A (Professor): OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions ,
Turn 161, B (Grad): Do something different ,
Turn 162, A (Professor): but this is the next suggestion ,
Turn 163, B (Grad): yeah .
Turn 164, A (Professor): so . OK . OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my {disfmarker} my short thing out about the NSF . I sent this {disfmarker} actually this is maybe a little side thing . Um , I {disfmarker} I sent to what I thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , which was " M {disfmarker} MTG RCDR hyphen joint " .
Turn 165, B (Grad): It was . Joint . Yep .
Turn 166, A (Professor): But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to {disfmarker}
Turn 167, B (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} That 's because they set the one up at UW {disfmarker}
Turn 168, F (Postdoc): 
Turn 169, B (Grad): that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub {comment} side .
Turn 170, A (Professor): Oh .
Turn 171, B (Grad): And so U - UW set it up as a moderated list .
Turn 172, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 173, A (Professor): Oh , OK .
Turn 174, B (Grad): And , I have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wanna mail to Mari
Turn 175, A (Professor): No {disfmarker} no , th I got {disfmarker} I got , uh , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on ,
Turn 176, B (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 177, A (Professor): so it 's {disfmarker}
Turn 178, B (Grad): OK , good .
Turn 179, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 180, B (Grad): So the moderator actually did repost it .
Turn 181, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 182, B (Grad): Cuz I had sent one earlier {disfmarker} Actually the same thing happened to me {disfmarker} I had sent one earlier . The message says , " You 'll be informed " and then I was never informed but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , so .
Turn 183, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 184, B (Grad): It 's just to prevent spam .
Turn 185, A (Professor): I see . Yeah so O {disfmarker} OK . Well , anyway , I guess {disfmarker} everybody here {disfmarker} Are y are {disfmarker} you are on that list , right ? So you got the note ?
Turn 186, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 187, A (Professor): Yeah ? OK .
Turn 188, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 189, A (Professor): Um , so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in before on {disfmarker} on more {disfmarker} more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , from {disfmarker} I guess higher level from my point of view . Uh , {vocalsound} and , uh , meeting mappings , and , uh {disfmarker} so is i for {disfmarker} it was a {vocalsound} proposal for the ITR program , uh , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation . It 's the {pause} second year of their doing , uh , these grants . They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} a lot of them are {disfmarker} some of them anyway , are larger {disfmarker} larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , and . So , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we {disfmarker} we , uh , got through that . And so th the {disfmarker} the next phase will be {disfmarker} we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . And I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hope to be doing very little of it . And {disfmarker} uh , {vocalsound} which was also true for the pre - proposal , so . Uh , there 'll be bunch of people working on it . So .
Turn 190, B (Grad): When 's {disfmarker} when 's the full proposal due ?
Turn 191, A (Professor): Uh , I think April ninth , or something . So it 's about a month .
Turn 192, E (PhD): p s
Turn 193, A (Professor): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 194, B (Grad): Yep . And they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms ,
Turn 195, G (PhD): u
Turn 196, B (Grad): is that {disfmarker}
Turn 197, G (PhD): Tomorrow .
Turn 198, A (Professor): Tomorrow . March second , I said .
Turn 199, E (PhD): Tomorrow ?
Turn 200, B (Grad): I 've been a day off all week .
Turn 201, C (PhD): Tomorrow .
Turn 202, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 203, B (Grad): I guess that 's a good thing cuz that way I got my papers done early .
Turn 204, G (PhD): It would be interesting {disfmarker}
Turn 205, A (Professor): So that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting !
Turn 206, B (Grad): It is . It is actually quite amazing .
Turn 207, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 208, G (PhD): It 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments .
Turn 209, A (Professor): Yeah . Yeah . My favorite is was when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when one reviewer says , uh , " you know , this should be far more detailed " , and the nex the next reviewer says , " you know , there 's way too much detail " .
Turn 210, B (Grad): Yep . Or " this is way too general " , and the other reviewer says , " this is way too specific " .
Turn 211, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 212, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 213, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 214, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 215, B (Grad): " This is way too hard " , " way too easy " .
Turn 216, A (Professor): We 'll see . Maybe there 'll be something useful . And {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 217, B (Grad): Well it sounded like they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} the first gate was pretty easy . Is that right ? That they didn't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ?
Turn 218, A (Professor): Do you know anything about the numbers ?
Turn 219, B (Grad): No . Just {disfmarker} just th
Turn 220, G (PhD): It 's just from his message it sounded like that .
Turn 221, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . I said something , yeah .
Turn 222, G (PhD): Gary Strong 's {disfmarker}
Turn 223, A (Professor): I
Turn 224, G (PhD): there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs
Turn 225, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 226, G (PhD): I {disfmarker}
Turn 227, A (Professor): I should go back and look . I didn't {disfmarker} I don't think that 's true .
Turn 228, B (Grad): Yeah , OK .
Turn 229, G (PhD): Mmm . He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive
Turn 230, E (PhD): Very {disfmarker} very ,
Turn 231, G (PhD): because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase .
Turn 232, E (PhD): yeah . Yeah .
Turn 233, A (Professor): Well we 'll have to see what the numbers are .
Turn 234, B (Grad): Or something like that ,
Turn 235, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 236, B (Grad): so .
Turn 237, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 238, A (Professor): Yeah . But they {disfmarker} they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers .
Turn 239, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 240, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 241, A (Professor): So , uh , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's usually a pretty {disfmarker} But it {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's certainly not {disfmarker} I 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something of what 's left .
Turn 242, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 243, A (Professor): I 'm sure it 's , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 244, B (Grad): How {disfmarker} how many awards are there , do you know ?
Turn 245, A (Professor): Well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size {disfmarker} They have three size grants . This one there 's , um {disfmarker} See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that they have a fair number of them . Um , and the large ones are , uh , boy , I forget , I think , more than , uh , more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . And {disfmarker} and we 're in the middle {disfmarker} middle category .
Turn 246, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 247, A (Professor): I think we 're , uh , uh , I forget what it was . But , um {disfmarker} Uh , I don't remember , but it 's {pause} pr probably along the li I {disfmarker} I could be wrong on this yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or {disfmarker} that they 'll fund , or twenty . I mean when they {disfmarker} Do you {disfmarker} do you know how many they funded when they f in {disfmarker} in Chuck 's , that he got last year ?
Turn 248, G (PhD): I don't {disfmarker} I don't know .
Turn 249, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 250, B (Grad): I thought it was smaller , that it was like four or five , wasn't it ?
Turn 251, A (Professor): Well they fund {disfmarker}
Turn 252, G (PhD): I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker}
Turn 253, A (Professor): they {disfmarker}
Turn 254, G (PhD): I don't remember .
Turn 255, A (Professor): yeah . I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 256, B (Grad): Uh it doesn't matter , we 'll find out one way or another .
Turn 257, A (Professor): Yeah . I mean last time I think they just had two categories , small and big ,
Turn 258, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 259, A (Professor): and this time they came up with a middle one , so it 'll {disfmarker} there 'll be more of them that they fund than {disfmarker} of the big .
Turn 260, G (PhD): If we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , what would we be doing with it ?
Turn 261, A (Professor): Uh .
Turn 262, B (Grad): Exactly what we say in the proposal .
Turn 263, G (PhD): I {disfmarker} I mean uh which part is ICSI though .
Turn 264, A (Professor): You know , it {disfmarker} i None of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about .
Turn 265, G (PhD): I mean {disfmarker} Dang !
Turn 266, A (Professor): Um , well , no , I mean it 's {disfmarker} u It {disfmarker}
Turn 267, G (PhD): It 's just for the research {disfmarker} to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff ?
Turn 268, A (Professor): It 's extending the research , right ? Because the other {disfmarker}
Turn 269, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 270, B (Grad): Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder .
Turn 271, A (Professor): Yeah . Yeah the other things that we have , uh , been working on with , uh , the c with Communicator {disfmarker} uh , especially with the newer things {disfmarker} with the more acoustically - oriented things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are lower level . And , this is dealing with , uh , mapping on the level of {disfmarker} of , um , the conversation {disfmarker} of mapping the conversations
Turn 272, G (PhD): Mm - hmm . Right , right .
Turn 273, A (Professor): to different kind of planes . So . Um . But , um . So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , or none of us are funded for , so it 's {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker} it would be new .
Turn 274, G (PhD): So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ?
Turn 275, A (Professor): Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , and {disfmarker} Uh . Yeah , there {disfmarker} there would be {disfmarker} there would be new hires , and {disfmarker} and there {disfmarker} there would be expansion , but , also , there 's always {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for everybody there 's {disfmarker} there 's always things that are dropping off , grants that are ending , or other things that are ending , so ,
Turn 276, G (PhD): Right .
Turn 277, A (Professor): there 's {disfmarker} there 's a {vocalsound} continual need to {disfmarker} to bring in new things .
Turn 278, C (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 279, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 280, G (PhD): Right .
Turn 281, A (Professor): But {disfmarker} but there definitely would be new {disfmarker} new {disfmarker} new , uh , students ,
Turn 282, G (PhD): I see .
Turn 283, A (Professor): and so forth , both at {disfmarker} at UW and here .
Turn 284, B (Grad): Are there any students in your class who are {vocalsound} expressing interest ?
Turn 285, A (Professor): Um , not {pause} clear yet . Not clear yet .
Turn 286, B (Grad): Other than the one who 's already here .
Turn 287, A (Professor): I mean we got {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} yeah , two of them are {disfmarker} two in the c There 're {pause} two in the class already here , and then {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} uh , then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , who , uh {disfmarker} But he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't be in the country that long ,
Turn 288, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 289, A (Professor): and , maybe another will end up .
Turn 290, B (Grad): Yep .
Turn 291, A (Professor): Actually there is one other guy who 's looking {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's that guy , uh , Jeremy ? {comment} I think .
Turn 292, C (PhD): Mm - hmm . 
Turn 293, A (Professor): Anyway , yeah that 's {disfmarker} that 's all I was gonna say is that {disfmarker} that that 's {disfmarker} you know , that 's nice and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , and , {vocalsound} it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in {disfmarker} in March in getting the proposal out , and then , it 's , uh , you know {disfmarker} We 'll see what happens . Uh , the last one was {disfmarker} that you had there , {comment} was about naming ?
Turn 294, B (Grad): Yep . It just , uh {disfmarker} we 've been cutting up sound files , in {disfmarker} for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition . And Liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming . So , uh , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length so that sorting is easier . Um ,
Turn 295, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 296, B (Grad): same number of characters so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want . And that 's easy enough to do . And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . So that means , uh , instead of calling it " MR one " , " MR two " , you 'd call it " MRM zero zero one " , " MRM zero zero two " , things like that . Just so that they 're {disfmarker} they 're all the same length .
Turn 297, F (Postdoc): But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always {disfmarker} as long as you have {disfmarker} uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string .
Turn 298, B (Grad): The problem is that they 're a lot of fields .
Turn 299, F (Postdoc): You know , so " zero zero two " {disfmarker}
Turn 300, B (Grad): Alright ,
Turn 301, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 302, B (Grad): so we {disfmarker} we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID , the session , uh {disfmarker} uh , information on the microphones ,
Turn 303, F (Postdoc): Yeah , well , your example was really {disfmarker}
Turn 304, B (Grad): information on the speak on the channels and all that .
Turn 305, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 306, F (Postdoc): i
Turn 307, B (Grad): And so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier .
Turn 308, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 309, D (Grad): She wanted to keep them {vocalsound} the same lengths across different meetings also . So like , the NSA meeting lengths , {comment} all filenames are gonna be the same length as the Meeting Recorder meeting names ?
Turn 310, B (Grad): Yep . And as I said , the it 's {disfmarker} we just don't have that many that that 's a big deal .
Turn 311, G (PhD): Cuz of digits .
Turn 312, B (Grad): And so , uh , um , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off , let the transcribers have a few days off , make sure no one 's touching the data and reorganize the file structures . And when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming .
Turn 313, F (Postdoc): I {disfmarker} I would think though that the transcribe {disfmarker} the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names .
Turn 314, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 315, F (Postdoc): So , I mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , and channels and stuff ,
Turn 316, B (Grad): Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names ,
Turn 317, F (Postdoc): so , it 's a different {pause} set .
Turn 318, B (Grad): I would change them to match . So instead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one . But I don't think that 's a big deal .
Turn 319, F (Postdoc): Fine . Fine .
Turn 320, B (Grad): So for {disfmarker} for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers for meeting I Ds . Uh , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers , For , uh {disfmarker} and , uh , that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent . Um , and then , uh , the microphone issues . We want some way of specifying , more than looking in the " key " file , what channel and what mike . What channel , what mike , and what broadcaster . Or {disfmarker} I don't know how to s say it . So I mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w {pause} as a wireless .
Turn 321, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 322, E (PhD): Yep .
Turn 323, B (Grad): And you know that one is a different headset and different channel . And so we just need some naming conventions on that .
Turn 324, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 325, B (Grad): And , uh ,
Turn 326, C (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 327, B (Grad): that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out , um , once I test them . And then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll need to specify that somewhere . So I was just gonna do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types .
Turn 328, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 329, B (Grad): So , as I said {disfmarker}
Turn 330, E (PhD): OK .
Turn 331, G (PhD): That sounds good .
Turn 332, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 333, A (Professor): Um , {pause} {vocalsound} since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how {disfmarker} how are the transcriptions going ? Yeah .
Turn 334, F (Postdoc): The {disfmarker} the news is that I 've {disfmarker} I uh {disfmarker} s So {disfmarker} in s um {disfmarker} So I 've switched to {disfmarker} Start my new sentence . I {disfmarker} I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the {disfmarker} uh , tighter time bins for {disfmarker} partly for use in Thilo 's work and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . And , um , I discovered in the process a couple of {disfmarker} of interesting things , which , um , one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , uh , uh , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . And I {disfmarker} and I wanted to maybe ask , uh , Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . Maybe {disfmarker} I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later . And I {disfmarker} I have a script , I can piece them together . I mean , so it 's like , I {disfmarker} I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is .
Turn 335, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 336, F (Postdoc): And it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of {disfmarker} of , uh , utterances to check through .
Turn 337, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 338, A (Professor): I 'm a little confused . I thought that {disfmarker} that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than {disfmarker} than , uh , the {disfmarker} the other transcription , uh , thing was that {disfmarker} that we were using the mixed {pause} file .
Turn 339, F (Postdoc): Oh , yes . OK . But , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a {disfmarker} a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers .
Turn 340, A (Professor): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 341, F (Postdoc): So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap .
Turn 342, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 343, F (Postdoc): And for purposes of {disfmarker} of , uh , things like {disfmarker} well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing .
Turn 344, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 345, F (Postdoc): Th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that .
Turn 346, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 347, F (Postdoc): And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , um , you know , I 've {disfmarker} th the {disfmarker} So , I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point . But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand and I really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal , um , having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction .
Turn 348, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 349, F (Postdoc): Um , I did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , um , um , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .
Turn 350, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 351, F (Postdoc): As you might expect ,
Turn 352, A (Professor): Sure .
Turn 353, F (Postdoc): because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps , which is what I wanna do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening {comment} to every single channel all the way through the entire {comment} length for all the different speakers . Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . So it 's li you know , kind of wondering {disfmarker} And I think again it 's like this {disfmarker} it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting .
Turn 354, E (PhD): Yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem I think . Uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it {disfmarker} it can {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so .
Turn 355, F (Postdoc): OK . Well so then {disfmarker} then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,
Turn 356, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 357, F (Postdoc): just so that they 're {disfmarker} they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases .
Turn 358, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 359, F (Postdoc): Cuz there are large s spaces of the {disfmarker} That 's a good point . There are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all . Someone 's giving a presentation ,
Turn 360, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 361, F (Postdoc): or whatever . That 's {disfmarker} that 's a good {disfmarker} that 's a good thought . And , um , let 's see , there was one other thing I was gonna say . I {disfmarker} I think it 's really interesting data to work with , I have to say , it 's very enjoyable . I really , not {disfmarker} not a problem spending time with these data . Really interesting . And not just because I 'm in there . No , it 's real interesting .
Turn 362, A (Professor): Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting . Uh , you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume ,
Turn 363, C (PhD): Is true .
Turn 364, F (Postdoc): 
Turn 365, A (Professor): and {disfmarker}
Turn 366, C (PhD): I haven't results , eh , yet
Turn 367, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 368, C (PhD): but , eh , I {disfmarker} I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , {comment} after the {disfmarker} the last experience .
Turn 369, A (Professor): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 370, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} and I 'm tried to {disfmarker} to , uh , adjust the {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , I {disfmarker} I implement .
Turn 371, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 372, C (PhD): But I have problem because , eh , I get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now .
Turn 373, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 374, C (PhD): Um , harmonic {disfmarker} possi possible harmonics , uh , eh , and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to {disfmarker} to find , eh , some kind of a , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of h of help , eh , using the energy to {disfmarker} to distinguish between possible harmonics , and {disfmarker} and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . And , eh , I have to {disfmarker} to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because I have , eh , an algorithm , and , I get , mmm , eh , t t results {disfmarker} similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that I {disfmarker} I am following . But , eh , the {disfmarker} the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to {disfmarker} to distinguish the harmonics , is {disfmarker} doesn't work well .
Turn 375, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 376, C (PhD): And I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I not sure that i {vocalsound} eh , the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} o to {disfmarker} ob the way to obtain the {disfmarker} the instantaneous frequency is {pause} right , or it 's {disfmarker} it 's not right . Eh ,
Turn 377, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 378, C (PhD): I haven't enough file feeling to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to distinguish what happened .
Turn 379, A (Professor): Yeah , I 'd like to talk with you about it . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} If I don't have enough time and y you wanna discuss with someone else {disfmarker} some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be Stephane .
Turn 380, C (PhD): Yeah . I talked with Stephane and {disfmarker} and Thilo
Turn 381, A (Professor): Yeah and {disfmarker} and Thilo , yeah .
Turn 382, C (PhD): and ,
Turn 383, A (Professor): Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Turn 384, C (PhD): they {disfmarker} nnn they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {comment} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {vocalsound} didn't {disfmarker}
Turn 385, E (PhD): I 'm not too experienced with {vocalsound} harmonics
Turn 386, A (Professor): I see .
Turn 387, C (PhD): they think that {comment} the experience is not enough to {disfmarker}
Turn 388, E (PhD): and {disfmarker}
Turn 389, G (PhD): Is {disfmarker} is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ?
Turn 390, C (PhD): No , no it 's {disfmarker} No {disfmarker} No . No .
Turn 391, G (PhD): And then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy {disfmarker}
Turn 392, A (Professor): Yeah , that 's wh
Turn 393, C (PhD): No . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't proth process the {disfmarker} the fundamental . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I , ehm {disfmarker} I calculate the {disfmarker} the phase derivate using the FFT .
Turn 394, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 395, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} The algorithm said that , eh , {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} if you change the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , eh , nnn {disfmarker} the X - the frequency " X " , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the {disfmarker} the harmonics , eh ,
Turn 396, A (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 397, C (PhD): the errors of peaks {disfmarker} the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around {pause} these , eh {disfmarker} eh frequency harmonic {disfmarker} the frequency of the harmonic . And , {vocalsound} eh , if you {disfmarker} if you compare the {disfmarker} the instantaneous frequency , {vocalsound} eh , {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of the , eh , continuous , eh , {vocalsound} eh , filters , that , eh {disfmarker} that , eh , they used eh , to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to {disfmarker} to get , eh , the {disfmarker} the instantaneous frequency ,
Turn 398, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 399, C (PhD): it probably too , you can find , {vocalsound} eh , that the instantaneous frequency {vocalsound} for the continuous , eh , {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker} the output of the continuous filters are very near . And in {pause} my case {disfmarker} i in {disfmarker} equal with our signal , {vocalsound} it doesn't happened .
Turn 400, A (Professor): Yeah . I 'd hafta look at that and think about it .
Turn 401, C (PhD): And {disfmarker}
Turn 402, A (Professor): It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I haven't worked with that either so I 'm not sure {disfmarker} The way {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a {disfmarker} a sieve . You know , y you actually say that here is {disfmarker}
Turn 403, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 404, A (Professor): Let 's {disfmarker} let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and {disfmarker} and , uh , maybe you {disfmarker} maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by {disfmarker} by uh , making some guesses ,
Turn 405, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 406, A (Professor): but {disfmarker} but uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh , I would , uh {disfmarker} I mean you could make some guesses from , uh {disfmarker} from the auto - correlation or something but {disfmarker} but then , given those guesses , try , um , uh , only looking at the energy at multiples of the {disfmarker} of that frequency , and {disfmarker} and see how much of the {disfmarker} take the one that 's maximum . Call that the {disfmarker}
Turn 407, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 408, A (Professor): But {disfmarker}
Turn 409, C (PhD): Using the energy of the {disfmarker} of the multiple of the frequency .
Turn 410, A (Professor): Of all the harmonics of that . Yeah .
Turn 411, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 412, G (PhD): Do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ?
Turn 413, C (PhD): I don't use .
Turn 414, G (PhD): Or {disfmarker}
Turn 415, C (PhD): But , I {disfmarker} I know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to get , eh , the pitch .
Turn 416, A (Professor): No . To get the pitch , yes .
Turn 417, C (PhD): I don't use . To get the pitch , yes .
Turn 418, E (PhD): To get the pitch , yeah .
Turn 419, C (PhD): But the harmonic , no .
Turn 420, G (PhD): But i But the harmonics are gonna be , uh , uh , I don't know what the right word is . Um , they 're gonna be dampened by the uh , vocal tract , right ? The response of the vocal tract .
Turn 421, A (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 422, C (PhD): Yeah ?
Turn 423, G (PhD): And so {disfmarker} just looking at the energy on those {disfmarker} at the harmonics , is that gonna {disfmarker} ?
Turn 424, A (Professor): Well so the thing is that the {disfmarker} This is for , uh , a , um {disfmarker}
Turn 425, G (PhD): I m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract . Right ?
Turn 426, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 427, G (PhD): And just look at the {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at the signal coming out of the glottis .
Turn 428, A (Professor): Yeah . Uh , well , yeah that 'd be good .
Turn 429, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 430, A (Professor): But , uh {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but I don't know that you need to {disfmarker}
Turn 431, B (Grad): Open wide !
Turn 432, A (Professor): but I don't need you {disfmarker} know if you need to get rid of it . I mean that 'd {disfmarker} that 'd be nice but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . Um , I mean {disfmarker} cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying {disfmarker}
Turn 433, G (PhD): Uh - huh .
Turn 434, A (Professor): wha what are you doing this for ? You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where there are more than {disfmarker} uh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker .
Turn 435, B (Grad): Sorry .
Turn 436, A (Professor): So if there 's more than one speaker , um {disfmarker} yeah I guess you could {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} yeah you 're {disfmarker} so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced , so {disfmarker} so , i if you don't {disfmarker} if you don't care about that {disfmarker}
Turn 437, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 438, A (Professor): See , if you also wanna {vocalsound} just determine {disfmarker} if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , {vocalsound} then I think you want to {pause} look {disfmarker} look at high frequencies also , because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced .
Turn 439, G (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 440, A (Professor): But , i i uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean i i but , um , other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be {pause} primarily a low frequency phenomenon . And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna {disfmarker} there 's gonna be a spectral slope . The higher frequencies will be lower energy . But so what . I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} that 's w
Turn 441, C (PhD): I will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity and {pause} will {disfmarker} will try to come in and to discuss here , because , eh , I haven't enough feeling to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to u {vocalsound} many time to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to understand what happened with the {disfmarker} with , eh , so many peaks , eh , eh , and {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I see the harmonics there many time but , eh , {vocalsound} there are a lot of peaks , eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics .
Turn 442, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 443, C (PhD): Um , I have to discover what {disfmarker} what is the {disfmarker} the w the best way to {disfmarker} to {comment} {disfmarker} to {comment} c to use them
Turn 444, A (Professor): Well , but {disfmarker} yeah I don't think you can {disfmarker} I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame , so I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean I {disfmarker} I really {disfmarker} I I really thought that the best way to do it , and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , but , {vocalsound} my impression was that the best way to do it was however you {disfmarker} You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . {comment} However you 've come up {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that
Turn 445, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 446, A (Professor): as coppo as opposed to all of the {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} the total energy . And , um , if it 's voiced , I guess {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . But if it 's voiced ,
Turn 447, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 448, A (Professor): um , and the , uh {disfmarker} e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be {disfmarker} then it 's more likely to be an overlap .
Turn 449, C (PhD): Is height . Yeah . This {disfmarker} this is the idea {disfmarker} the idea I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had to {disfmarker} to compare the {disfmarker} the ratio of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the energy of the harmonics with the {disfmarker} eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum and try to get a ratio to {disfmarker} to distinguish between overlapping and speech . Mmm .
Turn 450, A (Professor): But you 're looking a y you 're looking at {disfmarker} Let 's take a second with this . Uh , uh , you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , um , in {disfmarker} in , uh , what domain ? I mean this is {disfmarker} this is in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in bands ? Or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Turn 451, C (PhD): No , no , no .
Turn 452, A (Professor): Just {disfmarker} just overall {disfmarker}
Turn 453, C (PhD): It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} o i w the band {disfmarker} the band is , eh , from zero to {disfmarker} to four kilohertz . And I {disfmarker} I ot I {disfmarker}
Turn 454, A (Professor): And you just take the instantaneous frequency ?
Turn 455, C (PhD): Yeah . I u m t I {disfmarker} I used two m two method {disfmarker} two methods . Eh , one , eh , based on the F {disfmarker} eh , FTT . to FFT to {disfmarker} to obtain the {disfmarker} or to study the harmonics from {disfmarker} from the spectrum directly ,
Turn 456, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 457, C (PhD): and to study the energy and the multiples of
Turn 458, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 459, C (PhD): frequency . And another {disfmarker} another algorithm I have is the {disfmarker} in the {pause} instantaneous frequency , based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on the FFT to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to calculate the {disfmarker} the phase derivate in the time . Eh , uh n the d I mean I {disfmarker} I have two {disfmarker} two algorithms .
Turn 460, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 461, C (PhD): But , eh , in m {pause} i in my opinion the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the instantaneous frequency , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the behavior , eh , was {disfmarker} th it was very interesting . Because I {disfmarker} I saw {vocalsound} eh , how the spectrum {pause} concentrate , eh ,
Turn 462, A (Professor): Oh !
Turn 463, C (PhD): around the {disfmarker} the harmonic . But then when I apply the {disfmarker} the rule , eh , of the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} {pause} the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the {disfmarker} the near filter , the {disfmarker} the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper doesn't work . And I don't know why .
Turn 464, A (Professor): But the instantaneous frequency , wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the {disfmarker} you know , of the {disfmarker} where most of the energy is ? I mean , I think if you {disfmarker} Does i does it {disfmarker} Why would it correspond to pitch ?
Turn 465, C (PhD): Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I not sure . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I try to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker}
Turn 466, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 467, C (PhD): When {vocalsound} first I {disfmarker} {pause} {vocalsound} I calculate , eh , using the FFT ,
Turn 468, F (Postdoc): Di - digital camera .
Turn 469, C (PhD): the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Turn 470, B (Grad): Keep forgetting .
Turn 471, C (PhD): I get the {disfmarker} {pause} the spectrum ,
Turn 472, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 473, C (PhD): and I represent all the frequency .
Turn 474, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 475, C (PhD): And {disfmarker} when ou I obtained the instantaneous frequency . And I change {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the @ @ , using the instantaneous frequency , here .
Turn 476, A (Professor): Oh , so you scale {disfmarker} you s you do a {disfmarker} a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous {disfmarker}
Turn 477, C (PhD): I use {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 478, A (Professor): It 's a kinda normalization .
Turn 479, C (PhD): Yeah . Yeah . Because when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker}
Turn 480, A (Professor): OK .
Turn 481, C (PhD): eh , when i I {disfmarker} I use these {disfmarker} these frequency , eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different .
Turn 482, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 483, C (PhD): And I observe more {disfmarker} more or less , thing like this . And the paper said that , eh , these frequencies are probably , eh , harmonics .
Turn 484, A (Professor): I see . Huh .
Turn 485, C (PhD): But , eh , they used , eh , a rule , eh , based in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} because to {disfmarker} to calculate the instantaneous frequency , they use a Hanning window .
Turn 486, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 487, C (PhD): And , they said that , eh , if {pause} these {pause} peak are , eh , harmonics , the f instantaneous frequency , of the contiguous , eh {disfmarker} w eh eh , filters are very near , or have to be very near . But , eh , phh ! I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don I I {disfmarker} and I don't know what is the {disfmarker} what is the distance . And I tried to {disfmarker} to put different distance , eh , to put difference , eh {disfmarker} eh , length of the window , eh , different front sieve , Pfff ! and I {disfmarker} I not sure what happened .
Turn 488, A (Professor): OK , yeah well I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm not following it enough . I 'll {comment} probably gonna hafta look at the paper , but {disfmarker} which I 'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm curious about it .
Turn 489, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 490, A (Professor): Um , uh , OK .
Turn 491, F (Postdoc): I I did i it did occur to me that this is {disfmarker} uh , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths . So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . And the reason I ask the question is , um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , uh , the fact that there was some {disfmarker} I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you ,
Turn 492, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 493, F (Postdoc): and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that {disfmarker} in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe {disfmarker} And I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know , I mean we had this an and I didn't {disfmarker} couldn't get back to you ,
Turn 494, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 495, F (Postdoc): but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation ,
Turn 496, A (Professor): I don't know {disfmarker} think it 'd be ideal .
Turn 497, F (Postdoc): cuz {disfmarker}
Turn 498, G (PhD): Uh - uh .
Turn 499, A (Professor): We - See , we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible
Turn 500, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 501, A (Professor): and breaths are part of real speech .
Turn 502, F (Postdoc): Well , except that these are really truly {disfmarker} I mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did {disfmarker} n the first one that I did for {disfmarker} i for this ,
Turn 503, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 504, F (Postdoc): where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like {disfmarker} as if we 're {disfmarker} you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like {disfmarker} it 's like {disfmarker}
Turn 505, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 506, F (Postdoc): I y i I mean , breath is natural , but not
Turn 507, A (Professor): It is {disfmarker} but it is if you record it .
Turn 508, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 509, F (Postdoc): Except that we 're {disfmarker} we 're trying to mimic {disfmarker} Oh , I see what you 're saying . You 're saying that the PDA application would have {disfmarker} uh , have to cope with breath .
Turn 510, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 511, B (Grad): Well
Turn 512, E (PhD): No .
Turn 513, F (Postdoc): But {disfmarker}
Turn 514, G (PhD): An - any application may have to .
Turn 515, B (Grad): The P D A might not have to ,
Turn 516, E (PhD): No {disfmarker} i
Turn 517, B (Grad): but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus .
Turn 518, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 519, B (Grad): So {disfmarker} so mean you 're right
Turn 520, F (Postdoc): OK , then the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} I have two questions .
Turn 521, B (Grad): we could remove it ,
Turn 522, F (Postdoc): Yeah ?
Turn 523, B (Grad): but I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} we don't wanna w remove it from the corpus , {pause} in terms of delivering it because the {disfmarker} people will want it in there .
Turn 524, A (Professor): Yeah . If it gets {disfmarker}
Turn 525, F (Postdoc): OK , so maybe the question is notating it . Yeah ?
Turn 526, A (Professor): Yeah {disfmarker} i Right . If {disfmarker} if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it , but you {disfmarker} it 's real data . You don't wanna b but you don't {disfmarker}
Turn 527, F (Postdoc): OK , well {disfmarker}
Turn 528, A (Professor): If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is {disfmarker} is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even {disfmarker} And we have the f uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the fan and the {disfmarker} in the projector up there , and , uh , this is {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} this is actual stuff that we {disfmarker} we wanna work with .
Turn 529, F (Postdoc): Well this is in very interesting
Turn 530, A (Professor): So .
Turn 531, F (Postdoc): because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research because in {disfmarker} in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative .
Turn 532, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 533, F (Postdoc): And {disfmarker} breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . And once in a while breath is communicative , but r very rarely . OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure
Turn 534, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 535, F (Postdoc): and the idea is that the transcripts will {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses .
Turn 536, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 537, F (Postdoc): And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . You know , like , Don 's been writing scripts
Turn 538, A (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 539, F (Postdoc): and {disfmarker} and , uh , to process it for the speech recognition side . Discourse side will {vocalsound} have this {disfmarker} this side over he the {disfmarker} we we 'll have a s ch Sorry , not being very fluent here . But , um , this {disfmarker} the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . OK . So then the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . So what I would {disfmarker} r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? Could we get a breath detector ?
Turn 540, B (Grad): Oh , just to save the transcribers time .
Turn 541, F (Postdoc): Well , I mean , you just have no idea . I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute ,
Turn 542, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 543, F (Postdoc): and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to {disfmarker} to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time .
Turn 544, B (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 545, E (PhD): Oops .
Turn 546, A (Professor): Wh - what {disfmarker}
Turn 547, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 548, F (Postdoc): And you wanna be sure it 's used , and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal .
Turn 549, A (Professor): what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ?
Turn 550, F (Postdoc): Well , but {disfmarker}
Turn 551, A (Professor): So you just know it 's between these other things ,
Turn 552, F (Postdoc): Well , OK . So now there 's {disfmarker} there 's another {disfmarker} another possibility
Turn 553, A (Professor): right ?
Turn 554, F (Postdoc): which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words {comment} from nonwords . And that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient .
Turn 555, A (Professor): Yeah I mean I 'm think if it 's too {disfmarker} if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , {vocalsound} we are gonna be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if {disfmarker} so , {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a " breath " or a " breath - in " or " breath - out " , {vocalsound} the models will learn that sort of thing . Uh , so {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} but you do want them to point them at some region where {disfmarker} where the breaths really are . So {disfmarker}
Turn 556, F (Postdoc): OK . But that would maybe include a pause as well ,
Turn 557, G (PhD): Well , there 's a there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 558, F (Postdoc): and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ?
Turn 559, A (Professor): Yeah , i You know there is {disfmarker} there 's this dynamic tension between {disfmarker} between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . Basically the more we can mark the better . But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this {disfmarker} Although I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'd be interested to h get {disfmarker} get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they {disfmarker} Cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in {disfmarker} in , uh , uh , their transcripts .
Turn 560, B (Grad): They have lots of experience with breathing ?
Turn 561, G (PhD): I {disfmarker}
Turn 562, A (Professor): Actually {disfmarker} Well , {vocalsound} yes they do , but we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can handle that without them here . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , you were gonna say something about {disfmarker}
Turn 563, G (PhD): Yeah , I {disfmarker} I think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that , um , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe , u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . If there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that .
Turn 564, E (PhD): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 565, F (Postdoc): That 's what they 've been doing . So , within an overlap segment , they {disfmarker} they do this .
Turn 566, G (PhD): Right . But {disfmarker} Right . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , don't {disfmarker} don't worry about that .
Turn 567, E (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 568, G (PhD): So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um {disfmarker} So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . But outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed . So you just {disfmarker} somebody can't rely on that data and say " that 's perfectly clean data " . Uh {disfmarker} do you see what I 'm saying ?
Turn 569, F (Postdoc): Yeah , you 're saying it 's {disfmarker} uncharted territory .
Turn 570, G (PhD): So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .
Turn 571, A (Professor): That sounds like a reasonable {disfmarker} reasonable compromise .
Turn 572, E (PhD): Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that quite co corresponds to the way I {disfmarker} I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as I really try to {disfmarker} not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with {disfmarker} which are just in {disfmarker} in a silence region .
Turn 573, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 574, E (PhD): And they {disfmarker} so they hopefully won't be marked in {disfmarker} in those channel - specific files .
Turn 575, A (Professor): u I {disfmarker} I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes .
Turn 576, E (PhD): But {disfmarker}
Turn 577, G (PhD): Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Turn 578, F (Postdoc): Mm - hmm .
Turn 579, A (Professor): See , in a {disfmarker} in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , uh , research , uh , um , e a {disfmarker} it 's not just a minor part . In fact , the {disfmarker} I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . So it 's critical {disfmarker} it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . Because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of . That 's our problem . If we had nothing {disfmarker}
Turn 580, F (Postdoc): Yeah .
Turn 581, A (Professor): if we had only linguistically - relevant things {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , uh , we {disfmarker} we didn't have noise , we didn't have convolutional errors , we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , and {vocalsound} moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now . I mean you can you know it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} the technology 's come along pretty well .
Turn 582, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 583, A (Professor): The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason we still complain about it is because is {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when you have more realistic conditions then {disfmarker} then things fall apart .
Turn 584, F (Postdoc): OK , fair enough . I guess , um , I {disfmarker} uh , what I was wondering is what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , um , and then you 'd have to {disfmarker}
Turn 585, A (Professor): But that 's a research question , you know ? And so {disfmarker}
Turn 586, F (Postdoc): Yeah , well , see and that 's what I wouldn't know .
Turn 587, A (Professor): that {disfmarker} And we don't either . I mean so {disfmarker} so the thing is it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so {vocalsound} we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . So , you know , an and maybe {disfmarker} maybe in five years it 'll work really well ,
Turn 588, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 589, A (Professor): and {disfmarker} and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so .
Turn 590, F (Postdoc): I guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the {disfmarker} in the more recent , uh , recordings , so it 's {disfmarker} in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the {disfmarker} on the earlier ones .
Turn 591, A (Professor): Uh - huh . I see .
Turn 592, G (PhD): One of the {disfmarker} um , just to add to this {disfmarker} one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . I mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .
Turn 593, A (Professor): Right .
Turn 594, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 595, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 596, G (PhD): And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are .
Turn 597, C (PhD): Hmm .
Turn 598, A (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 599, G (PhD): So {disfmarker} I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . We don't have to go and search for them to {disfmarker} to mark them at all , but , I mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible .
Turn 600, F (Postdoc): OK , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted .
Turn 601, C (PhD): Yeah .
Turn 602, G (PhD): Mm - hmm .
Turn 603, F (Postdoc): OK .
Turn 604, A (Professor): Should we do the digits ?
Turn 605, B (Grad): Yep . OK .
Turn 606, C (PhD): OK .
Turn 607, D (Grad): Mmm . Alright .
