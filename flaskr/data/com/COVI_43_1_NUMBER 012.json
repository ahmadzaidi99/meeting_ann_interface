The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing.\n              I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair.

This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking.\n              The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime.\n              Thank you very much."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "261864", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Is anyone else presenting petitions? \n              Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members.\n              \n              We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.

Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling.\n              Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing.

The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes.

I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario.

To do so, we need the proper information. We need to know the status of the public finances. That is why the Bloc Québécois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June 17. This is not about making a spectacle. Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge. We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that. But we have to know to what extent. We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going. This is about respecting the public, because they are the ones who will be paying the bill.\n              In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada.

Just in the last two months, we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words.\n              On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. Those are payday loan rates. The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder. That's not emergency assistance; it's pandemic profiteering.\n              Programs can't help workers if businesses can't or won't actually get the support.

While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved.\n              I have a simple question for the Prime Minister.\n              On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs.

We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses.\n              What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify.

Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. \n              Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage."}, {"turn": 339, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward."}, {"turn": 340, "speakerID": "261669", "name": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "contribution": "A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source.\n              Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?"}, {"turn": 341, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. \n              In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place—"}, {"turn": 342, "speakerID": "261817", "name": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "contribution": "We go back to Ms. Jansen."}, {"turn": 343, "speakerID": "261669", "name": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "contribution": "Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?"}, {"turn": 344, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month."}, {"turn": 345, "speakerID": "261669", "name": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "contribution": "That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?"}, {"turn": 346, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive."}, {"turn": 347, "speakerID": "261669", "name": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "contribution": "We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?"}, {"turn": 348, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system."}, {"turn": 349, "speakerID": "261669", "name": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "contribution": "In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?"}, {"turn": 350, "speakerID": "261529", "name": "Hon. Anita Anand", "contribution": "We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible.\n              Thank you so much."}, {"turn": 351, "speakerID": "261817", "name": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "contribution": "Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today.
