Turn 0, B (Grad): what things to talk about .
Turn 1, F (Grad): I 'm {disfmarker} What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive !
Turn 2, A (Grad): OK , we 're recording .
Turn 3, F (Grad): Hello ?
Turn 4, B (Grad): Check check {pause} check check .
Turn 5, D (Grad): Uh , yeah .
Turn 6, F (Grad): Hello ? Which am I ?
Turn 7, C (Professor): Oh right .
Turn 8, B (Grad): Alright . Good .
Turn 9, F (Grad): Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is {disfmarker} on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .
Turn 10, D (Grad): Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} wait .
Turn 11, F (Grad): And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .
Turn 12, E (Grad): This is just one sheet , right ?
Turn 13, D (Grad): Ah ! Just one sheet .
Turn 14, F (Grad): It 's just one sheet .
Turn 15, D (Grad): OK .
Turn 16, F (Grad): It 's just a {disfmarker} Nothing else .
Turn 17, D (Grad): Front , back .
Turn 18, F (Grad): Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's very similar to {disfmarker} There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are {disfmarker} all these things are {disfmarker} it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .
Turn 19, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 20, F (Grad): And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I {disfmarker} I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .
Turn 21, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 22, F (Grad): Um , maybe I will {disfmarker} let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um {disfmarker} to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a {disfmarker} sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There {disfmarker} there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .
Turn 23, C (Professor): What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right .
Turn 24, F (Grad): So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction
Turn 25, C (Professor): Oh , I see .
Turn 26, F (Grad): and they have some name .
Turn 27, C (Professor): So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct
Turn 28, F (Grad): Yeah , right .
Turn 29, C (Professor): OK , that 's fine .
Turn 30, F (Grad): OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word " construct " , th here you might have " meaning " or " form " as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word " construct " and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word " throw " , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , " happy " , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say " I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here " or " I need a directional specifier here " . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , " I " , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .
Turn 31, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 32, F (Grad): And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .
Turn 33, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 34, F (Grad): And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , " the big th " , you you know , " the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man " , you know , " walked into the room " .
Turn 35, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 36, F (Grad): But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , then I don't think the , {comment} um {disfmarker} at least {disfmarker} Yeah . {comment} None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs , {comment} to say something about the relation . And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript . The F subscripts refer to the " form " piece of the construct .
Turn 37, C (Professor): Good .
Turn 38, F (Grad): And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . So {disfmarker} so by saying {disfmarker} if I just said " Name one " then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc {comment} Which {disfmarker} which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate " here I mean the meaningful for some reason " . Right ? Or {disfmarker} Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , " George and Jerry walk into the room in that order " .
Turn 39, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 40, F (Grad): So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form . But {disfmarker} but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on . OK , and so in terms of the {disfmarker} the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding . You know , you could say that , um , you know , " name - one dot " , t you know , " number equals " , you know , a plural or something like that .
Turn 41, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 42, F (Grad): There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below but I mean they 're just {disfmarker} us usually they 're going to be value {disfmarker} value fillers , right ? OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just {disfmarker} are just bindings . There was talk of changing the name of that . And Johno and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you and I can like fight about that if you like ? but about changing it to " semantic {pause} n effects " , which I thought was a little bit too order - biased
Turn 43, B (Grad): Well {disfmarker} Th
Turn 44, F (Grad): and " semantic bindings " , which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings . And so it was an issue whether constraints {disfmarker} um , there were some linguists who reacted against " constraints " , saying , " oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it shouldn't be called a constraint " . But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ? Cuz there are {disfmarker} I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes .
Turn 45, C (Professor): Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I {disfmarker}
Turn 46, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 47, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah . It 's used shouldn't matter , right ? Mm - hmm .
Turn 48, C (Professor): s For sure . I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use
Turn 49, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 50, C (Professor): but we don't want to {disfmarker}
Turn 51, F (Grad): Yeah , uh , there was one time when {disfmarker} when Hans explained why " constraints " was a misleading word for him .
Turn 52, C (Professor): Yep .
Turn 53, F (Grad): And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term , which was just an interesting coincidence . Um , but , uh {disfmarker} And so I was like , " OK , well both of you don't like it ?
Turn 54, C (Professor): It 's g it 's gone .
Turn 55, F (Grad): Fine , we can change it " . But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm starting to like it again .
Turn 56, B (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 57, F (Grad): So that that 's why {disfmarker} {comment} That 's why I 'll stick with it .
Turn 58, A (Grad): Well , you know what ?
Turn 59, F (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 60, A (Grad): If you have an " if - then " phrase , do you know what the " then " phrase is called ?
Turn 61, C (Professor): Th
Turn 62, F (Grad): What ? Con - uh , a consequent ?
Turn 63, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 64, F (Grad): Yeah , but it 's not an " if - then " .
Turn 65, A (Grad): No , but {disfmarker}
Turn 66, C (Professor): I know . Anyway , so the other {disfmarker} the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word ,
Turn 67, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 68, C (Professor): just meaning . OK ? And the then let {disfmarker}
Turn 69, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 70, F (Grad): Yeah , that 's true .
Turn 71, B (Grad): So that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down {disfmarker} down here ?
Turn 72, F (Grad): Oh , oops ! No . That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it .
Turn 73, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 74, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 75, F (Grad): So , I 'm sorry . I didn't mean {disfmarker} that one 's an in unintentional .
Turn 76, B (Grad): So this should be semantic and {disfmarker}
Turn 77, F (Grad): Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent
Turn 78, B (Grad): 
Turn 79, F (Grad): cuz I 'm not sure yet . Here , I actually {disfmarker} it was just a mistake .
Turn 80, B (Grad): Th - so this definitely should be " semantic constraints " down at the bottom ?
Turn 81, E (Grad): Sure .
Turn 82, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 83, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 84, F (Grad): Well , unless I go with " meaning " but i I mean , I kind of like " meaning " better than " semantic "
Turn 85, B (Grad): Or {disfmarker}
Turn 86, C (Professor): Oh , whatever .
Turn 87, F (Grad): but I think there 's {pause} vestiges of other people 's biases .
Turn 88, C (Professor): Or {disfmarker} wh That - b
Turn 89, F (Grad): Like {disfmarker}
Turn 90, C (Professor): Right . Minor {disfmarker} min problem {disfmarker}
Turn 91, F (Grad): Minor point .
Turn 92, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 93, E (Grad): Extremely .
Turn 94, F (Grad): OK , um , so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and {disfmarker} and that you can drop the , um {disfmarker} uh , that you can give dual types . Oh , one thing I should mention is about " designates " . I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block .
Turn 95, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 96, F (Grad): So basically now , um , this is actually {disfmarker} this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that " designates " isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now .
Turn 97, C (Professor): Good .
Turn 98, F (Grad): So we want s " designates " to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , " are you of type {disfmarker} is this part of type whatever " , um , the " designates " tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . OK , so if you have like " the big red ball " , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun . Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase .
Turn 99, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 100, F (Grad): Um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um {disfmarker} to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? So the ball is the head of the phrase , " the r the {disfmarker} " , um , " big red ball " , and the entity denoted by the word " ball " is sort of the semantic head in some ways of {disfmarker} of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element .
Turn 101, C (Professor): A a and the {disfmarker} Yeah . And there 's {disfmarker} uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . And {disfmarker} and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right .
Turn 102, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 103, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 104, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 105, F (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 106, E (Grad): That 's the idea .
Turn 107, C (Professor): Yeah yeah .
Turn 108, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 109, F (Grad): And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know {disfmarker} the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision .
Turn 110, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 111, F (Grad): So that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in .
Turn 112, C (Professor): OK , so that all looks good . Let me {disfmarker} Oh , w Oh . I don't know . Were you finished ?
Turn 113, F (Grad): Um , there was a list of things that isn't included but you {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can ask a question . That might @ @ it .
Turn 114, C (Professor): OK . So , i if I understand this the {disfmarker} aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the {disfmarker} the differences are mainly that , {vocalsound} we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type
Turn 115, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 116, C (Professor): or actually gone back to ,
Turn 117, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 118, C (Professor): if we go back far enough {disfmarker}
Turn 119, F (Grad): Well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that , uh {disfmarker} Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . So I don't know what a form type is .
Turn 120, C (Professor): Oh , I see . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm sorry , you 're right .
Turn 121, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 122, C (Professor): A construction type . Uh , that 's fine . But it , um {disfmarker}
Turn 123, F (Grad): Right . A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it . So you could say " construct of type whatever designates something " .
Turn 124, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 125, F (Grad): But that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time I think .
Turn 126, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 127, F (Grad): Um , I {disfmarker} I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know {disfmarker} that 's kind of weird .
Turn 128, C (Professor): No , no , no , I don't think so . I think that you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll do fine .
Turn 129, E (Grad): I {disfmarker}
Turn 130, C (Professor): In fact , these are , um , as long as {disfmarker} as Mark isn't around , these are form constraints . So a nominal expression is {disfmarker} uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of {disfmarker} of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one .
Turn 131, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 132, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 133, F (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 134, C (Professor): And I think that 's just fine .
Turn 135, E (Grad): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 136, F (Grad): Which is fine , yeah .
Turn 137, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 138, E (Grad): It 's {disfmarker} that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , I {disfmarker} I don't know if I ever explained this but the point of , um , I mentioned in the last meeting , {comment} the point of having something called " nominal expression " is , um , because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? So you wanna , you know {disfmarker} you sort of have this problem like " OK , well , I 'll put the word " , uh , let 's say , the word " dog " , you know . And that has to come right after the verb
Turn 139, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 140, E (Grad): cuz we know verb meets its object . And then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have " the " preceding a noun . And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum .
Turn 141, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 142, E (Grad): And you could get , you know , " the kicked dog " or something like that , meaning " kicked the dog " .
Turn 143, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 144, E (Grad): Um , so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there
Turn 145, C (Professor): That I {disfmarker} I have no problem with it at all .
Turn 146, E (Grad): but {disfmarker} It - it
Turn 147, C (Professor): I think it 's fine .
Turn 148, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 149, F (Grad): Yeah . Right , n s you may be {disfmarker} you may not be like everyone else in {disfmarker} in Berkeley ,
Turn 150, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 151, F (Grad): but that 's OK .
Turn 152, E (Grad): I mean , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh {disfmarker} with , a p
Turn 153, F (Grad): Uh , we don't mind either , so {disfmarker}
Turn 154, E (Grad): I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of {disfmarker} of phrase structure .
Turn 155, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 156, E (Grad): But , uh ,
Turn 157, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 158, E (Grad): I just know that this is {disfmarker} Like , we didn't originally have in mind that , uh {disfmarker} that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form .
Turn 159, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 160, C (Professor): But they do .
Turn 161, E (Grad): Um , but they does .
Turn 162, F (Grad): Well , there 's an alternative to this
Turn 163, E (Grad): At least in English .
Turn 164, F (Grad): which is , um {disfmarker} The question was did we want directed motion ,
Turn 165, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 166, F (Grad): which is an argument structure construction {disfmarker}
Turn 167, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 168, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 169, F (Grad): did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic {disfmarker} You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations ,
Turn 170, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 171, F (Grad): those could intersect with these in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions .
Turn 172, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 173, F (Grad): And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . But you know , for now , I mean ,
Turn 174, C (Professor): Yeah . But it {disfmarker} y y it 's {disfmarker} yeah , just moving it {disfmarker} moving the c the cons the constraints around .
Turn 175, F (Grad): uh , you know . M moving it to another place , right .
Turn 176, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 177, C (Professor): OK , so that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 178, F (Grad): But there does {disfmarker} basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ?
Turn 179, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 180, F (Grad): So , yeah .
Turn 181, C (Professor): And so that was the {disfmarker}
Turn 182, F (Grad): Robert 's not happy now ?
Turn 183, A (Grad): No !
Turn 184, F (Grad): Oh , OK .
Turn 185, C (Professor): OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair .
Turn 186, F (Grad): Yes .
Turn 187, C (Professor): Instead of just the meaning .
Turn 188, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 189, C (Professor): And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it .
Turn 190, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 191, C (Professor): I just want to b I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm asking .
Turn 192, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 193, F (Grad): Yep .
Turn 194, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 195, F (Grad): Yeah , um , the un sort of the un - addressed questions in this , um , definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about .
Turn 196, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 197, F (Grad): Here are just bindings but , right ? we might want to introduce mental spaces {disfmarker} You know , there 's all these things that we don't {disfmarker}
Turn 198, C (Professor): The whole {disfmarker} the mental space thing is clearly not here .
Turn 199, F (Grad): Right ? So there 's going to be some extra {disfmarker} you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now .
Turn 200, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 201, C (Professor): By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back .
Turn 202, F (Grad): Uh Yeah .
Turn 203, C (Professor): So , uh , the {disfmarker} the mental space thing .
Turn 204, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 205, C (Professor): Um , obviously , {vocalsound} construal is a b is a b is a big component of that
Turn 206, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 207, C (Professor): so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back . But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um , we ought to {disfmarker}
Turn 208, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 209, E (Grad): So what 's the {disfmarker} what 's the time frame ? I forgot again when you 're going away for how long ?
Turn 210, A (Grad): Just , uh , as a {disfmarker} sort of a mental bridge , I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm skipping fourth of July . So , uh , {vocalsound} right afterwards I 'm back .
Turn 211, E (Grad): OK . OK .
Turn 212, F (Grad): What ? You 're missing like the premier American holiday ? What 's the point of spending a year here ?
Turn 213, A (Grad): Uh , I 've had it often enough .
Turn 214, F (Grad): So , anyway .
Turn 215, B (Grad): Well he w he went to college here .
Turn 216, F (Grad): Oh , yeah , I forgot . Oops . {comment} Sorry .
Turn 217, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 218, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 219, C (Professor): And furthermore it 's well worth missing .
Turn 220, F (Grad): Not in California .
Turn 221, E (Grad): Yes .
Turn 222, F (Grad): Yeah , that 's true . I like {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I like spending fourth of July in other countries , {vocalsound} whenever I can .
Turn 223, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 224, F (Grad): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 225, C (Professor): OK , so that 's great .
Turn 226, F (Grad): Construal , OK , so {disfmarker} Oh , so there was one question that came out . I hate this thing . Sorry . Um , which is , so something like " past " which i you know , we think is a very simple {disfmarker} uh , we 've often just stuck it in as a feature ,
Turn 227, C (Professor): Right . Right .
Turn 228, F (Grad): you know , " oh , {pause} this event takes place before speech time " , {comment} OK , is what this means . Um , it 's often thought of as {disfmarker} it is also considered a mental space ,
Turn 229, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 230, F (Grad): you know , by , you know , lots of people around here .
Turn 231, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 232, F (Grad): So there 's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say " in France , blah - blah - blah " ,
Turn 233, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 234, F (Grad): and you have to build up {disfmarker} you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery , whereas past is a very conventionalized one and we sort of know what it means but it {disfmarker} we doesn't {disfmarker} don't necessarily want to , you know , unload all the notation every time we see that it 's past tense .
Turn 235, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 236, F (Grad): So , you know , we could think of our {disfmarker} uh , just like X - schema " walk " refers to this complicated structure , past refers to , you know , a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it .
Turn 237, C (Professor): I think that 's exactly right .
Turn 238, F (Grad): So {disfmarker} so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it {disfmarker}
Turn 239, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 240, F (Grad): you know , having it both ways , right ?
Turn 241, C (Professor): Yeah . {pause} No , I think {disfmarker} I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details
Turn 242, F (Grad): So , i i Mm - hmm .
Turn 243, C (Professor): but my intuition would be that that 's right .
Turn 244, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah , OK .
Turn 245, A (Grad): Do you want to do the same for space ?
Turn 246, F (Grad): Wha - sorry ?
Turn 247, A (Grad): Space ?
Turn 248, F (Grad): Space ?
Turn 249, A (Grad): Here ? Now ?
Turn 250, F (Grad): Oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ?
Turn 251, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 252, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah , yeah . Same thing . So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? And then I think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y whatever {disfmarker}
Turn 253, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 254, F (Grad): You could build up an appropriately {disfmarker} uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence .
Turn 255, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 256, A (Grad): Hmm , well this {disfmarker} this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your C dot something {disfmarker}
Turn 257, E (Grad): N
Turn 258, A (Grad): you know , where {disfmarker} where it 's contextually dependent ,
Turn 259, F (Grad): Yeah . Right .
Turn 260, A (Grad): " what is now , what was past ,
Turn 261, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 262, A (Grad): what is in the future , where is this , what is here , what is there , what is {disfmarker} "
Turn 263, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah . So time and space . Um , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get that on the other side a little , like very minimally . There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place .
Turn 264, C (Professor): Good .
Turn 265, F (Grad): And you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , {comment} there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now . If there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so {disfmarker} hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job ,
Turn 266, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 267, F (Grad): like or somebody 's job anyway .
Turn 268, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 269, F (Grad): I 'm gonna point to {disfmarker} at random .
Turn 270, E (Grad): Yeah . I mean , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm s curious about how much of the mental {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not sure that the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things , {comment} is gonna have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff . You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of {disfmarker} I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know {disfmarker} assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um {disfmarker} the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to .
Turn 271, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 272, E (Grad): So " in France , uh , Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon " or something like that . Um , well , you say , " alright , I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe " or something like that . The information in the sentence tells you that much but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it {disfmarker} what the point of doing so is . So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be {disfmarker} like the question is for example , what does " Watergate " refer to there ? Does it , you know {disfmarker} does it refer to , um {disfmarker} if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say " Watergate " you 're referring to " a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France " . But in a different context , " oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't {disfmarker} you know , Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all " . Now we 're s now that " Watergate " {disfmarker} we 're now talking about the real one ,
Turn 273, F (Grad): They 're real , right .
Turn 274, E (Grad): and the " would " sort of {disfmarker} it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ? We 're not saying {disfmarker} What 's hypothetical about this world .
Turn 275, F (Grad): I see {disfmarker} right .
Turn 276, E (Grad): In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France .
Turn 277, F (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 278, E (Grad): In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away
Turn 279, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 280, E (Grad): or something . Right ?
Turn 281, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 282, E (Grad): So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level .
Turn 283, C (Professor): Correct .
Turn 284, E (Grad): Uh , um , and so {disfmarker}
Turn 285, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 286, E (Grad): I don't know where that sits then ,
Turn 287, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 288, E (Grad): sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant .
Turn 289, F (Grad): It seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the {disfmarker} the most basi
Turn 290, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 291, F (Grad): th those we {disfmarker} I think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ?
Turn 292, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 293, F (Grad): There are sort of a relatively limited number . And then how they interact with some extra thing like " in France " or " if such - and - such " , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can {disfmarker}
Turn 294, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 295, F (Grad): You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you .
Turn 296, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 297, F (Grad): I think . But , you know , whatever ,
Turn 298, C (Professor): Yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going .
Turn 299, F (Grad): we {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker}
Turn 300, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 301, C (Professor): Uh , I {disfmarker} uh , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}
Turn 302, E (Grad): But the whole point of {disfmarker} the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about , uh , mental spaces , and blending , and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence . You know , there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . It just says , " Here . Add this structure to this space . " and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , " what the space configuration is at the time of utterance " .
Turn 303, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 304, E (Grad): And so somebody 's gonna have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me , I think .
Turn 305, C (Professor): Well {disfmarker} I think that 's right . Oh , I {disfmarker} yeah , I , uh , uh {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} Not k I th I don't think it 's completely right . I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b the form did constrain the meaning ,
Turn 306, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 307, C (Professor): and so , um , it isn't , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 308, E (Grad): Sure , but like what {disfmarker} what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France ? That is not {disfmarker} there is nothing about that in the {disfmarker} in the sentence really .
Turn 309, F (Grad): That 's OK . We usually don't know the point of the sentence at all .
Turn 310, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 311, F (Grad): But we know what it 's trying to say .
Turn 312, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 313, E (Grad): Y yeah .
Turn 314, F (Grad): We {disfmarker} we know that it 's {disfmarker} what predication it 's setting up .
Turn 315, C (Professor): But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} bottom line , I agree with you ,
Turn 316, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 317, F (Grad): That 's all .
Turn 318, C (Professor): that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f
Turn 319, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 320, F (Grad): Purely linguistic cues , right ?
Turn 321, C (Professor): uh , the purely form cues , yeah .
Turn 322, F (Grad): So .
Turn 323, C (Professor): And , um {disfmarker} I mean , you 're {disfmarker} you 're the linguist
Turn 324, F (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 325, C (Professor): but , uh , it seems to me that th these {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something .
Turn 326, E (Grad): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 327, C (Professor): Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 328, E (Grad): Yeah . Oh , yeah .
Turn 329, C (Professor): uh , I {disfmarker} I mean , that {disfmarker} that 's my feeling that {disfmarker} that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what {disfmarker} what 's going on .
Turn 330, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 331, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 332, F (Grad): OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like " profile , designate , focus " , et cetera , et cetera .
Turn 333, C (Professor): Uh , right , right , right .
Turn 334, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 335, F (Grad): Um , for now I 'm gonna say like " profile " 's often used {disfmarker} like two uses that come to mind immediately . One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . So " hypotenuse " , you profiled this guy against the background of the {pause} right t right triangle .
Turn 336, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 337, F (Grad): OK . And the second use , um , is in FrameNet. It 's slightly different . Oh , I was asking Hans about this . They use it to really mean , um , this {disfmarker} in a frame th this is {disfmarker} the profiles on the {disfmarker} these are the ones that are required . So they have to be there or expressed in some way . Which {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive but they 're {disfmarker} they 're different meanings .
Turn 338, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 339, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 340, F (Grad): So the closest thing {disfmarker} so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation . For us , um {disfmarker} OK , so how is it {disfmarker}
Turn 341, C (Professor): Does that {disfmarker} Is that really what they mean in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker}
Turn 342, F (Grad): so " designate " {disfmarker} FrameNet ?
Turn 343, C (Professor):  I didn't know that .
Turn 344, F (Grad): FrameNet ? Yeah , yeah . I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I was a little bit surprised about it too .
Turn 345, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 346, F (Grad): I knew that {disfmarker} I thought that that would be something like {disfmarker} there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing
Turn 347, C (Professor): Right , OK .
Turn 348, F (Grad): but they {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way . And {disfmarker}
Turn 349, C (Professor): Well , I 'll check .
Turn 350, F (Grad): and may maybe he 's wrong . Anyway , so I think the {disfmarker} the " designate " that we have in terms of meaning is really the " highlight this thing with respect to everything else " . OK ?
Turn 351, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 352, F (Grad): So this is what {disfmarker} what it means . But the second one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it ? We don't have a notation for it but we might want one . So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item " walk " , you know it 's an action . Well , it also has this idea {disfmarker} it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody 's gonna do the walking . Or if you talk about an adjective " red " , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red . So we used to use the notation " with " for this
Turn 353, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 354, F (Grad): and I think that 's closest to their second one . So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it . It might be {disfmarker} it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require {disfmarker} you know , these things are like it 's semantically part of it {disfmarker}
Turn 355, C (Professor): N no , no . Well , uh , th critically they 're not required syntactically . Often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff .
Turn 356, F (Grad): Right . Right , right . Yeah , um , definitely . So , um , " in " was a good example . If you walk " in " , like well , in what ?
Turn 357, C (Professor): Right , there 's {disfmarker}
Turn 358, F (Grad): You know , like you have to have the {disfmarker} {comment} So {disfmarker} so it 's only semantically is it {disfmarker} it is still required , say , by simulation time though
Turn 359, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 360, F (Grad): to have something . So it 's that {disfmarker} I meant the idea of like that {disfmarker} the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation . I don't know if that 's something we need to spa to {disfmarker} to like say ever as part of the requirement ? {disfmarker} or the construction ? or not . We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll again defer .
Turn 361, C (Professor): Or {disfmarker} I mean , or {disfmarker} or , uh so the {disfmarker}
Turn 362, F (Grad): Have it construed ,
Turn 363, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 364, F (Grad): is that the idea ? Just point at Robert . Whenever I 'm confused just point to him .
Turn 365, C (Professor): Right . It 's {disfmarker} it 's his thesis , right ?
Turn 366, F (Grad): You tell me .
Turn 367, C (Professor): Anyway ,
Turn 368, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 369, C (Professor): right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever .
Turn 370, F (Grad): OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I {disfmarker} we have thoughts about those as well .
Turn 371, C (Professor): Yeah . Great .
Turn 372, F (Grad): Um , the I w I would just s some of this is just like my {disfmarker} you know , by fiat . I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it .
Turn 373, C (Professor): I {disfmarker} that 's fine .
Turn 374, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 375, F (Grad): I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .
Turn 376, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 377, F (Grad): So , s I think that the way I {disfmarker} we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of {disfmarker} basically this is the information structure .
Turn 378, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 379, F (Grad): OK , it 's like {disfmarker} uh , it 's not {disfmarker} it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like , you know , I think Keith was telling me , {comment} things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused {disfmarker} focused element ,
Turn 380, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 381, F (Grad): the new information . You know , if I {disfmarker} " I walked into the room " , you {disfmarker} tend to think that , whatever , " into the room " is sort of like the more focused kind of thing .
Turn 382, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 383, F (Grad): And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . So that 's like the new {disfmarker} the sort of like import or whatever of {disfmarker} of this thing . Uh , so {disfmarker} so I think that 's kind of nice to keep " focus " being an information structure term . " Stress " {disfmarker} I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . So , um , like " stress " , th stress is kind of a pun on {disfmarker} you might have like {disfmarker} whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress .
Turn 384, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 385, F (Grad): And that 's just a {disfmarker} uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device . You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever .
Turn 386, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 387, F (Grad): Um , t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect which is , " Oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values " , right ? So focus carries along a scope . Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know {disfmarker} it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't .
Turn 388, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 389, F (Grad): Um , so my classic {disfmarker} my now - classic example of saying , " Oh , he did go to the meeting ? " ,
Turn 390, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 391, F (Grad): that was my way of saying {disfmarker} as opposed to , you know , " Oh , he didn't g " or " There was a meeting ? "
Turn 392, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 393, F (Grad): I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately .
Turn 394, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 395, F (Grad): And so , um , the {disfmarker} like if you said he {disfmarker} you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 396, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 397, F (Grad): " he walked to the meeting " as opposed to " he ran " , or " he did walk to the meeting " as opposed to " he didn't walk " . You know ,
Turn 398, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 399, F (Grad): so we need to have a notation for that which , um , I think that 's still in progress . So , sort of I 'm still working it out . But it did {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say " here are the possible things that you could focus on " , cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know {disfmarker} all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus .
Turn 400, C (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 401, F (Grad): But I think one {disfmarker} the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ? So for instance , you could say it 's the {disfmarker} the tense on this as opposed to , um , the {disfmarker} the action . OK . Or it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things , or stress this value as opposed to other things . So , um , it 's {disfmarker} it is kind of like a profile {disfmarker} profile - background thing but I {disfmarker} I can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would {disfmarker} that you would focu
Turn 402, E (Grad): Light up with focus , yeah .
Turn 403, F (Grad): light {disfmarker} highlight as opposed to other ones . So it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh {disfmarker} later on . Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements . For instance , you {disfmarker} Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements and that 's probably relevant for the like " where is " , you know , " the castle " kind of thing ?
Turn 404, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 405, F (Grad): Because you might want to say that , um , location or cert certain WH words bring {disfmarker} you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , " I don't know the identity of this thing " kind of way on certain elements . So . OK . Anyway . So that 's onl there are {disfmarker} there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it 's most {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} this is , you know , the current {disfmarker} current form . Other things we didn't {vocalsound} totally deal with , um ,
Turn 406, E (Grad): Oh , there 's a bunch .
Turn 407, F (Grad): well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective .
Turn 408, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 409, F (Grad): You know , a {disfmarker} a nominal expression .
Turn 410, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 411, F (Grad): And , um , I mean , we should have put an example of this and we could do that later .
Turn 412, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 413, F (Grad): But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though , that , um , we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like , you know , for instance , one {disfmarker} Uh , you know , they {disfmarker} they have constituents , right ? So you can like nest things when you need to , but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way . So if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience , then like this {disfmarker} this might , you know , be a little o opaque . But , you know , we have the {pause} properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents {disfmarker} constituent - based grammar . So that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for
Turn 414, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 415, F (Grad): and so far it 's worked out OK .
Turn 416, C (Professor): Good .
Turn 417, F (Grad): So . OK .
Turn 418, A (Grad): I can say two things about the f
Turn 419, F (Grad): Yes .
Turn 420, A (Grad): Maybe you want to forget stress . This {disfmarker} my f
Turn 421, F (Grad): As a word ?
Turn 422, A (Grad): No , as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} Just don't {disfmarker} don't think about it .
Turn 423, F (Grad): As a {disfmarker} What 's that ?
Turn 424, A (Grad): If {disfmarker}
Turn 425, F (Grad): Sorry .
Turn 426, A (Grad): canonically speaking you can {disfmarker} if you look at a {disfmarker} a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , " hey , that 's my focus exponent . "
Turn 427, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 428, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 429, A (Grad): It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is . If it 's just that thing ,
Turn 430, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Or the constituent that it falls in .
Turn 431, A (Grad): a little bit more or the whole phrase .
Turn 432, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 433, A (Grad): Um {disfmarker}
Turn 434, F (Grad): You mean t forget about stress , the form cue ?
Turn 435, A (Grad): The form bit
Turn 436, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 437, A (Grad): because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always {disfmarker} well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes .
Turn 438, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 439, A (Grad): And that 's also mostly true for read speech . In {disfmarker} in real speech , um , people may put stress . It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts .
Turn 440, F (Grad): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 441, A (Grad): It 's just , um {disfmarker} it 's absurd . It 's complicated .
Turn 442, F (Grad): OK ,
Turn 443, A (Grad): And all {disfmarker}
Turn 444, E (Grad): Yeah , I mean , I {disfmarker} I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence
Turn 445, F (Grad): I believe you , yeah .
Turn 446, E (Grad): and then ,
Turn 447, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Ways that you can get it come from th
Turn 448, E (Grad): hhh , {comment} the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that .
Turn 449, F (Grad): right .
Turn 450, E (Grad): You know , I mean , later on we 'll worry about exactly how {disfmarker}
Turn 451, A (Grad): Or {disfmarker} or map from the contour to {disfmarker} to what the focus exponent is .
Turn 452, E (Grad): y Yeah . Exactly .
Turn 453, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 454, E (Grad): But figure out how the {disfmarker}
Turn 455, A (Grad): But , uh , if you don't know what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're focus is then you 're {disfmarker} you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways ,
Turn 456, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 457, F (Grad): Right . That 's fine , yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 458, A (Grad): and the only way of figuring out what that is , {vocalsound} is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .
Turn 459, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 460, A (Grad): And then you 're left with a couple three . So , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do ,
Turn 461, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 462, A (Grad): um , but far outside the scope of {disfmarker} of any {disfmarker} anything . So . You know . It 's {disfmarker}
Turn 463, F (Grad): OK . Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in {disfmarker} in absence of all the oth
Turn 464, A (Grad): u u
Turn 465, F (Grad): you need all the other information I guess .
Turn 466, A (Grad): But it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . I mean , because
Turn 467, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 468, A (Grad): you can just say whatever stuff , " i is the container being focused or the {disfmarker} the entire whatever , both , and so forth . "
Turn 469, F (Grad): Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Turn 470, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 471, F (Grad): Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture .
Turn 472, C (Professor): Yeah , so b b but I think the poi I 'm not sure I understand but here 's what I th think is going on . That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it {disfmarker} the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus .
Turn 473, F (Grad): W uh , I 'm not sure about that .
Turn 474, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 475, F (Grad): Or it might limit {disfmarker} it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus .
Turn 476, C (Professor): Uh {disfmarker} k uh , at at the very least it constrai
Turn 477, F (Grad): I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's , th that 's certainly true . And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ?
Turn 478, C (Professor): Oh , uh , for sure , yes . There are constrai yeah , it 's not every {disfmarker} but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations
Turn 479, F (Grad): Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Turn 480, C (Professor): that you need to take into account in order to decide which {disfmarker} what is being focused .
Turn 481, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 482, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . So we talked about that a little bit this morning . " John is on the bus , not Nancy . "
Turn 483, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 484, A (Grad): So that 's {disfmarker} focuses on John .
Turn 485, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 486, F (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 487, A (Grad): " John is on the bus and not on the train . "
Turn 488, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 489, A (Grad): " John is on the bus " versus " John is on the train . "
Turn 490, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 491, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 492, A (Grad): And " John is on the bus " versus " was " , and e
Turn 493, F (Grad): Is on . " John is on the bus " . Yeah . Yeah .
Turn 494, A (Grad): " it 's the bu " so e
Turn 495, C (Professor): Right . Yeah , all {disfmarker} all of those .
Turn 496, A (Grad): All of these
Turn 497, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 498, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 499, A (Grad): and will we have {disfmarker} u is it all the same constructions ? Just with a different foc focus constituent ?
Turn 500, F (Grad): Yeah , I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of ,
Turn 501, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 502, F (Grad): I don't know {disfmarker} the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some {disfmarker} whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions . So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions . So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else .
Turn 503, C (Professor): Yeah . So , the question is actually {disfmarker}
Turn 504, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 505, C (Professor): oh , I 'm sorry ,
Turn 506, F (Grad): And it would {disfmarker}
Turn 507, C (Professor): go ahead ,
Turn 508, F (Grad): yeah ,
Turn 509, C (Professor): finish .
Turn 510, F (Grad): and it w and that would have to {disfmarker} uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . But it 's still is limited possibility .
Turn 511, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 512, F (Grad): So that should , you know , interact with {disfmarker} it should overlap with whatever other construction is there .
Turn 513, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 514, C (Professor): S s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something .
Turn 515, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Well , so that 's why I was saying how {disfmarker} since I couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot
Turn 516, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 517, F (Grad): and I think that should be able to refer to {disfmarker}
Turn 518, C (Professor): So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . OK .
Turn 519, F (Grad): Yeah , and , infer {disfmarker} and I don't have {disfmarker} I don't have a great way or great examples
Turn 520, C (Professor): I 'll - I 'll wait . OK .
Turn 521, F (Grad): but I think that {disfmarker} something like that is probably gonna be , uh , more {disfmarker} more what we have to do .
Turn 522, A (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 523, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 524, F (Grad): But , um ,
Turn 525, A (Grad): So
Turn 526, F (Grad): OK , that was one comment . And you had another one ?
Turn 527, A (Grad): Yeah , well the {disfmarker} once you know what the focus is the {disfmarker} everything else is background . How about " topic - comment " that 's the other side of information .
Turn 528, F (Grad): How about what ?
Turn 529, A (Grad): Topic - comment .
Turn 530, F (Grad): Yeah , so that was the other thing . And so I didn't realize it before . It 's like , " oh ! " It was an epiphany that it {disfmarker} you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . So topic is {disfmarker} Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . There 's {disfmarker} there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on .
Turn 531, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 532, F (Grad): Now I don't know whether {disfmarker} I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus , right ? Um , topic {disfmarker} it seems kind of {disfmarker} you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing .
Turn 533, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 534, E (Grad): Japanese has this though . You know .
Turn 535, F (Grad): Topic marker ?
Turn 536, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 537, E (Grad): Yeah , that 's what " wa " is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic .
Turn 538, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 539, E (Grad): It doesn't always have to be the subject .
Turn 540, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Right . So again , information structure has a topic slot . And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it .
Turn 541, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 542, F (Grad): Um , I think I stuck it in .
Turn 543, C (Professor): Yep , it 's there .
Turn 544, F (Grad): Um , and one thing that I didn't do consistently , um , is {disfmarker} when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . I think I have an idea of what it should be but th you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . I forg it 'll be a frame . You know , it 'll be {disfmarker} it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I don't know , some value from {disfmarker} from some something , some variable and scope or something like that , or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . OK , so well that 's {disfmarker} should we flip over to the other side officially then ?
Turn 545, A (Grad): Mm - hmm , hmm .
Turn 546, E (Grad): OK , side one .
Turn 547, F (Grad): I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on {disfmarker} on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? So I didn't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on .
Turn 548, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 549, F (Grad): And sort of {disfmarker} this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . But for instance you could imagine instead of having {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I changed the name of {disfmarker} um it used to be " entities " . So you see it 's " scenario " , " referent " and " discourse segment " . And " scenario " is essentially what kind of {disfmarker} what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw {disfmarker} draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f
Turn 550, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 551, F (Grad): you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be " entities " because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent {disfmarker} uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So " Harry walked into the room " , " Harry " and " room " , you know , the room {disfmarker} th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be {disfmarker} could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for {disfmarker} things like number , gender , um {disfmarker} ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are {disfmarker} are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure . Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . But {disfmarker} Um , and then the " status " I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the {disfmarker} the big com and {disfmarker} and finally " discourse segment " is about {vocalsound} sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity {disfmarker} the entity 's block to reference is that {vocalsound} you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might {disfmarker} that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to " reference " cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that . And {disfmarker} and these could actually just point to , you know , the {disfmarker} the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's {disfmarker} there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed " discourse status " as a slot where you could say it 's active . You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy {disfmarker} uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible .
Turn 552, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 553, F (Grad): It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . And the thing is that that {disfmarker} I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been ,
Turn 554, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 555, F (Grad): or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active .
Turn 556, C (Professor): This {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} yeah , well there {disfmarker} there seems to be context properties .
Turn 557, F (Grad): So .
Turn 558, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 559, F (Grad): Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . And it 's again , time , you know {disfmarker} at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you
Turn 560, C (Professor): Well , uh , uh , this is recursive
Turn 561, F (Grad): and {disfmarker}
Turn 562, C (Professor): cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure {disfmarker} {comment} Th - th
Turn 563, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 564, C (Professor): which is fine . We 'll just {disfmarker} we 'll j
Turn 565, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah . So some of these are , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 566, C (Professor): we just don't know yet .
Turn 567, F (Grad): Right . So I {disfmarker} so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific . Um , and I left the slot , " predications " , open because you can have , um , things like " the guy I know from school " .
Turn 568, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 569, F (Grad): Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's unclear whether {disfmarker} I mean , you could just have in your scenario , " here are some extra few things that are true " , right ?
Turn 570, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 571, F (Grad): And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? You 're {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but it 's used for identification purposes .
Turn 572, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 573, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 574, F (Grad): So it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little bit different from just saying " all these things are true from my utterance " .
Turn 575, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 576, F (Grad): Um .
Turn 577, E (Grad): Right , " this guy I know from school came for dinner " does not mean , um , " there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner " . That 's not the same effect .
Turn 578, F (Grad): Yeah , it 's a little bit {disfmarker} it 's a little bit different . Right ? So {disfmarker} Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive {disfmarker}
Turn 579, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 580, F (Grad): you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for {disfmarker} um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know {disfmarker} this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .
Turn 581, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 582, F (Grad): So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know {disfmarker} in identifying a particular referent would be , " oh , some {disfmarker} " you know , " it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school " .
Turn 583, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 584, F (Grad): So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find {disfmarker} you know , either create this reference ,
Turn 585, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 586, F (Grad): in which case it 'd be created here , and {disfmarker} you know , so {disfmarker} so you could imagine that this might not {disfmarker} So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .
Turn 587, A (Grad): But {disfmarker} to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise .
Turn 588, F (Grad): Um .
Turn 589, A (Grad): So " house " is gender neuter ? In reality
Turn 590, F (Grad): Um , it could be in {disfmarker}
Turn 591, A (Grad): or in {disfmarker}
Turn 592, C (Professor): Semantically .
Turn 593, A (Grad): semantically .
Turn 594, F (Grad): semantically , yeah . Yeah .
Turn 595, A (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 596, F (Grad): So it uh , uh , a table . You know , a thing that c doesn't have a gender . So . Uh , it could be that {disfmarker} I mean , maybe you 'd {disfmarker} maybe not all these {disfmarker} I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most {disfmarker} most things .
Turn 597, A (Grad): No , just to make sure that we {disfmarker} everybody that 's {disfmarker} completely agreed that it {disfmarker} it has nothing to do with , uh , form .
Turn 598, F (Grad): Yeah . OK , that is semantic as opposed to {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Um .
Turn 599, A (Grad): Then " predications " makes sense to {disfmarker} to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not .
Turn 600, F (Grad): S so again {disfmarker} Open to various things .
Turn 601, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 602, F (Grad): Right . OK , so . Let 's see . So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots {disfmarker} uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ?
Turn 603, E (Grad): Sure .
Turn 604, F (Grad): Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . And just a note , which was that , um {disfmarker} s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , OK , like a container or sort of support - ish . And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like " source , path , goal " is often thought of that way or " force " , or something like that . But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . So " path " , you could just be talking about the path between this and this .
Turn 605, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 606, F (Grad): And you know , " container " that you can go in and out . All of these things . And so , um , I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day {disfmarker} the " Spaniettes " , as we {vocalsound} called them {disfmarker} um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , X - schematic contributions . How do you link them up . And I think again , um , it 's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you " is this static or is this dynamic " . So we definitely need {disfmarker} that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ?
Turn 607, A (Grad): Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?
Turn 608, F (Grad): Uh . Yeah .
Turn 609, A (Grad): Just means {disfmarker}
Turn 610, F (Grad): Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ?
Turn 611, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 612, F (Grad): Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's {disfmarker} it 's like I was thinking of type constraints but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema . " Agent " , I mean , the {disfmarker} the performer of the X - schema , that s depends on the X - schema . You know , and I {disfmarker} in general it would probably be , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 613, E (Grad): So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .
Turn 614, F (Grad): Yeah , basically .
Turn 615, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 616, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 617, F (Grad): Um , " aspectual type " probably isn't obvious but I should have {disfmarker} So , I just neglected to stick something in . " Perspective " , " actor " , " undergoer " , " observer " , um ,
Turn 618, B (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 619, F (Grad): I think we 've often used " agent " , " patient " , obser
Turn 620, E (Grad): " Whee ! " That 's that one , right ?
Turn 621, F (Grad): Yeah , exactly . {vocalsound} Exactly . Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example {comment} of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know {disfmarker} definitely , it is one way to {disfmarker} for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? Well , maybe there are other things . You know , now that it 's {disfmarker} subject is more like a topic . And now that , you know {disfmarker} Anyway . So . Sorry . I 'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it 's not that f important right now .
Turn 622, C (Professor): N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if {disfmarker} if somebody figured out what the rules were .
Turn 623, F (Grad): Um , To know how {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . Exactly .
Turn 624, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 625, F (Grad): Um , some of these other ones , let 's see . So , uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts .
Turn 626, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 627, F (Grad): So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . So by default it 'll be like " true " , I guess , you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . You could imagine that you skip out this {disfmarker} you know , leave off this polarity , you know , not {disfmarker} don't have it here . And then have it part of the speech - act in some way .
Turn 628, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 629, F (Grad): There 's some negation . But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold , and you 're just talking , you know {disfmarker} if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that , you know , whatever , the holder doesn't and {disfmarker}
Turn 630, C (Professor): No , I th I think at this lev which is {disfmarker} it should be where you have it .
Turn 631, F (Grad): OK , it 's {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's fine where it is .
Turn 632, C (Professor): I mean , how you get it may {disfmarker} may in will often involve the discourse
Turn 633, F (Grad): So , OK . May come from a few places .
Turn 634, C (Professor): but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that .
Turn 635, F (Grad): Right . Right .
Turn 636, E (Grad): So , {vocalsound} I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at . The " scenario " box , like , what does that look like for an example ? Like , not all of these things are gonna be here .
Turn 637, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 638, C (Professor): Correct .
Turn 639, E (Grad): This is just basically says
Turn 640, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . It 's a grab bag of {disfmarker}
Turn 641, E (Grad): " part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas . Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there " .
Turn 642, F (Grad): So that 's exactly what it is .
Turn 643, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 644, F (Grad): And for a particular instance which I will , you know , make an example of something , is that you might have an instance of container and path , let 's say , as part of your , you know , " into " you know , definition .
Turn 645, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 646, F (Grad): So you would eventually have instances filled in with various {disfmarker} various values for all the different slots .
Turn 647, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 648, F (Grad): And they 're bound up in , you know , their bindings and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and values .
Turn 649, C (Professor): W it c
Turn 650, E (Grad): OK . Do you have to say about the binding in your {disfmarker} is there a slot in here for {disfmarker} that tells you how the bindings are done ?
Turn 651, C (Professor): No , no , no . I {disfmarker} let 's see , I think we 're {disfmarker} we 're not {disfmarker} I don't think we have it quite right yet . So , uh , what this is ,
Turn 652, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 653, C (Professor): let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . OK , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , {comment} you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context ,
Turn 654, E (Grad): OK . Mm - hmm .
Turn 655, C (Professor): which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . And bindings to ontology items .
Turn 656, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 657, C (Professor): So that {disfmarker} that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification .
Turn 658, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 659, C (Professor): So that 's A . But B , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions .
Turn 660, E (Grad): OK . Mm - hmm .
Turn 661, C (Professor): So this is an that anything you have , in the party line , {comment} anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this {disfmarker} ignoring li
Turn 662, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 663, C (Professor): I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it .
Turn 664, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 665, C (Professor): But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them .
Turn 666, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 667, C (Professor): Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , " source , path , goal " has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container .
Turn 668, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 669, C (Professor): Or whate whatever .
Turn 670, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 671, C (Professor): So those constraints appear in constructions
Turn 672, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 673, C (Professor): but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you .
Turn 674, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 675, F (Grad): Except for " cause " , that I forgot . But anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events .
Turn 676, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 677, C (Professor): OK , good . Let 's {disfmarker} let 's mark that . So we need a c
Turn 678, F (Grad): Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . These are all {disfmarker} so far these structures , especially from " path " and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots . Now with " cause " , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . Right ?
Turn 679, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 680, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 681, F (Grad): So you 'll say , " event one causes event B {disfmarker}
Turn 682, C (Professor): And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this again may ge our , um {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , of course , worlds .
Turn 683, F (Grad): uh , event two " , and {disfmarker}
Turn 684, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 685, F (Grad): Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one {disfmarker} within , uh within one world . Um , even though saying that place takes place , whatever . Uh , if y if I said " time " is , you know , " past " , that would say " set that this world " , you know , " somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time " .
Turn 686, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 687, F (Grad): So . But that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's sort of OK . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} within the event it 's st it 's still one world . Um . Yeah , so " cause " and {disfmarker} Other frames that could come in {disfmarker} I mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , " desire " or something like that ,
Turn 688, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 689, F (Grad): like " want " . And actually there is right now under " discourse segments " , um , " attitude " ?
Turn 690, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 691, F (Grad): " Volition " ? could fill that . So there are a couple things where I like , " oh , I 'm not sure if I wanted to have it there
Turn 692, E (Grad): Well that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 693, F (Grad): or {disfmarker} " Basically there was a whole list of {disfmarker} of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed . And , like , well , I don't {disfmarker} you know , it was like " hope , wish . desire " ,
Turn 694, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 695, E (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 696, F (Grad): blah - blah - blah . And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning {disfmarker} I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . So {disfmarker} They 're more lexically marked , right ?
Turn 697, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 698, F (Grad): At least in English . So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying , e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? You know , like " Naomi wants {disfmarker} wants su a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs " .
Turn 699, C (Professor): S right . So {disfmarker} so , " want " itself can be {disfmarker} {pause} i i i i i
Turn 700, F (Grad): u Can be just another frame that 's part of your {disfmarker}
Turn 701, C (Professor): Well , and it i basically it 's an action . In {disfmarker} in our s in our {disfmarker} in our {disfmarker}
Turn 702, F (Grad): Yeah . Situation . {comment} Right , right .
Turn 703, C (Professor): in {disfmarker} in our {disfmarker} in our s terminology , " want " can be an action and " what you want " is a world .
Turn 704, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 705, B (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 706, C (Professor): So that 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it .
Turn 707, F (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 708, C (Professor): Yeah , there {disfmarker} there are other things .
Turn 709, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 710, C (Professor): Causal stuff we absolutely need . Mental space we need .
Turn 711, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 712, C (Professor): The context we need . Um , so anyway , Keith {disfmarker} So is this comfortable to you that , uh , once we have this defined , it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions .
Turn 713, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 714, C (Professor): And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one .
Turn 715, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 716, C (Professor): And that 's the wh and {disfmarker} and I mean , that {disfmarker} according to the party line , that 's the whole story .
Turn 717, E (Grad): Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Um . y Right . That makes sense . So I mean , there 's this stuff in the {disfmarker} off in the scenario , which just tells you how various {disfmarker} what schemas you 're using and they 're {disfmarker} how they 're bound together . And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff {disfmarker} is that where you would sa
Turn 718, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 719, E (Grad): I mean , that 's {disfmarker} OK , that 's where the information structure is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this .
Turn 720, F (Grad): Right . Exactly .
Turn 721, E (Grad): I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff {disfmarker} Hmm . There 's almost {disfmarker} I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this {disfmarker} this , uh , trajector - landmark thing .
Turn 722, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 723, E (Grad): So if I say , um , You know , " In France it 's like this " . You know , great , we 've learned something about France but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast , like " In France it 's like this " . And therefore you 're supposed to say , " Boy , life sure {disfmarker} "
Turn 724, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 725, E (Grad): You know , " in France kids are allowed to drink at age three " . And w you 're {disfmarker} that 's not just a fact about France . You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U S . Right ?
Turn 726, F (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 727, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 728, E (Grad): And so {disfmarker}
Turn 729, F (Grad): S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now
Turn 730, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 731, F (Grad): and to think that there are , um ,
Turn 732, E (Grad): That comes in and , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 733, F (Grad): discourse level constructions in a sense , topic {disfmarker} topic - focus constructions that would say , " oh , when you focus something " then {disfmarker}
Turn 734, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Turn 735, F (Grad): just done the same way {disfmarker} just actually in the same way as the lower level . If you stressed , you know , " John went to the {disfmarker} " , you know , " the bar " whatever , you 're focusing that
Turn 736, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 737, F (Grad): and a in a possible inference is " in contrast to other things " .
Turn 738, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 739, F (Grad): So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , " in France such - and - such happens " .
Turn 740, E (Grad): Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Turn 741, F (Grad): So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible .
Turn 742, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 743, A (Grad): Uh , just {disfmarker} just , uh , look {disfmarker} read uh even sem semi formal Mats Rooth .
Turn 744, F (Grad): I mean {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 745, A (Grad): If you haven't read it . It 's nice .
Turn 746, F (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 747, A (Grad): And just pick any paper on alternative semantics .
Turn 748, F (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 749, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 750, A (Grad): So that 's his {disfmarker} that 's the best way of talking about focus , is I think his way .
Turn 751, E (Grad): OK , what was the name ?
Turn 752, A (Grad): Mats . MATS . Rooth .
Turn 753, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 754, A (Grad): I think two O 's , yes , TH .
Turn 755, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 756, A (Grad): I never know how to pronounce his name because he 's sort of ,
Turn 757, C (Professor): S Swede ?
Turn 758, A (Grad): uh , he is Dutch
Turn 759, C (Professor): Dutch ?
Turn 760, A (Grad): and , um {disfmarker} but very confused background I think .
Turn 761, C (Professor): Oh , Dutch .
Turn 762, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 763, C (Professor): Uh - huh .
Turn 764, A (Grad): So {pause} and , um ,
Turn 765, E (Grad): Mats Gould .
Turn 766, A (Grad): And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart . So he 's not there anymore .
Turn 767, E (Grad): Hmm .
Turn 768, A (Grad): But , um {disfmarker} I don't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is {disfmarker} if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff .
Turn 769, E (Grad): OK . OK . OK , thanks .
Turn 770, A (Grad): And what I 'm kind of confused about is {disfmarker} is what the speaker and the hearer is {disfmarker} is sort of doing there .
Turn 771, F (Grad): So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me .
Turn 772, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 773, F (Grad): Um , hearer is a little bit harder . It could be like multiple people . I guess that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's not very clear from here {disfmarker}
Turn 774, A (Grad): Yeah , but you {disfmarker} Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place ,
Turn 775, F (Grad): I mean , that 's not allowed here .
Turn 776, A (Grad): because " you " , " me " , " he " , " they " , you know , " these guys " , all these expressions , nuh , are in {disfmarker} in much the same way contextually dependent as " here , " and " now , " and " there " {disfmarker}
Turn 777, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 778, C (Professor): Now , this is {disfmarker} this is assuming you 've already solved that .
Turn 779, F (Grad): Ye - yeah .
Turn 780, C (Professor): So it 's {disfmarker} it 's Fred and Mary ,
Turn 781, F (Grad): So th
Turn 782, C (Professor): so the speaker would be Fred and the {disfmarker}
Turn 783, A (Grad): Ah !
Turn 784, F (Grad): Right , so the constructions might {disfmarker} of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever .
Turn 785, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 786, F (Grad): In which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . But when you actually say that " he walked into {disfmarker} " , whatever , um , the " he " will refer to a particular {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you will already have figured who " he " or " you " , mmm , or " I " , maybe is a bett better example , who " I " refers to . Um , and then you 'd just be able to refer to Harry , you know , in wherever that person {disfmarker} whatever role that person was playing in the event .
Turn 787, A (Grad): Mmm . That 's up at the reference part .
Turn 788, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 789, A (Grad): And down there in the speaker - hearer part ?
Turn 790, F (Grad): S so , that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's just {disfmarker} n for instance , Speaker is known from the situation , right ? You 're {disfmarker} when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is {disfmarker} I mean , you know who the speaker is . In fact , that 's kind of constraining how {disfmarker} in some ways you know this before you get to the {disfmarker} you fill in all the rest of it . I think .
Turn 791, C (Professor): Mmm .
Turn 792, F (Grad): I mean , how else would you um {disfmarker}
Turn 793, A (Grad): You know , uh , uh , it 's {disfmarker} the speaker may {disfmarker} in English is allowed to say " I . "
Turn 794, C (Professor): Yeah . Well , here {disfmarker}
Turn 795, A (Grad): Uh , among the twenty - five percent most used words .
Turn 796, F (Grad): Yeah . Right .
Turn 797, A (Grad): But wouldn't the " I " then set up the {disfmarker} the s s referent {disfmarker} that happens to be the speaker this time
Turn 798, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 799, A (Grad): and not " they , " whoever they are .
Turn 800, F (Grad): Right , right .
Turn 801, A (Grad): Or " you " {disfmarker}
Turn 802, F (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 803, A (Grad): much like the " you " could n
Turn 804, F (Grad): S so {disfmarker} OK , so I would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to " I " . And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to . So that 's " I " but , uh , uh , should we say it {disfmarker} it refers to , what ? Uh , if it were " Harry " it would refer to like some ontology thing . If it were {disfmarker} if it 's " I " it would refer to the current speaker , OK , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is .
Turn 805, A (Grad): Well , not {disfmarker} not always . I mean , so there 's " and then he said , I w " Uh - huh .
Turn 806, C (Professor): Uh {disfmarker}
Turn 807, F (Grad): " I " within the current world .
Turn 808, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 809, C (Professor): Yeah . That 's right . So {disfmarker} so again , this {disfmarker} uh , this {disfmarker} this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff
Turn 810, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 811, C (Professor): and t because you know , " Fred said that Mary said {disfmarker} " , and whatever .
Turn 812, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 813, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 814, C (Professor): And {disfmarker} and so we 're , uh gonna have to , um , chain those as well .
Turn 815, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Twhhh - whhh . But {disfmarker}
Turn 816, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . So this entire thing is inside a world ,
Turn 817, C (Professor): Right . Right .
Turn 818, F (Grad): not just like the top part .
Turn 819, C (Professor): I {disfmarker} I think , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 820, F (Grad): That 's {disfmarker}
Turn 821, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 822, C (Professor): Except s it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier than that because um , the reference for example {disfmarker} So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things ,
Turn 823, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 824, C (Professor): and this is where blends and all terribl So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't .
Turn 825, F (Grad): Yeah . Right .
Turn 826, C (Professor): And again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that .
Turn 827, F (Grad): Right . So I thought of having like {disfmarker} for each referent , having the list of {disfmarker} of the things t with which it is identified . You know , which {disfmarker} which , uh you know , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}
Turn 828, C (Professor): You could do that .
Turn 829, F (Grad): for instance , um {disfmarker} So , I guess , it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing .
Turn 830, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 831, F (Grad): If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever . If it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ? Or something in ontology .
Turn 832, C (Professor): uh - huh .
Turn 833, F (Grad): So , there 's a you know , whatever , it c it could point at one of these .
Turn 834, C (Professor): I just had a {disfmarker} I just had an {disfmarker} an idea that would be very nice if it works .
Turn 835, F (Grad): For what ?
Turn 836, C (Professor): Uh , uh , uh , I haven't told you what it is yet .
Turn 837, F (Grad): If it works .
Turn 838, C (Professor): This was my build - up .
Turn 839, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mmm .
Turn 840, C (Professor): An i an idea that would be nice i
Turn 841, F (Grad): Yeah . OK , we 're crossing our fingers .
Turn 842, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 843, B (Grad): So we 're building a mental space , good .
Turn 844, C (Professor): If it worked . Yeah .
Turn 845, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 846, C (Professor): Right , it was a space builder . Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not .
Turn 847, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 848, C (Professor): And so , i
Turn 849, F (Grad): Yep .
Turn 850, C (Professor): it c it {disfmarker} it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure .
Turn 851, F (Grad): Use the same {disfmarker} {comment} Yep .
Turn 852, C (Professor): So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena .
Turn 853, B (Grad): I see .
Turn 854, F (Grad): Mm - hmm . And {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Turn 855, C (Professor): Uh , I 've {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've never seen anybody write that up but maybe they did . I don't know . That may be all over the literature .
Turn 856, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 857, E (Grad): There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in {disfmarker} I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a {disfmarker} a verb of saying then
Turn 858, F (Grad): So {disfmarker} so by default {disfmarker}
Turn 859, E (Grad): um , you know , you say something like {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or I was thinking you can say something like , " oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican " or something like that . Where as in English you would say , " I thought you were " .
Turn 860, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 861, E (Grad): Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there , so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah .
Turn 862, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 863, E (Grad): Same things happens with pronouns .
Turn 864, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 865, E (Grad): There 's languages where , um , if you have a verb of saying then , ehhh , where {disfmarker} OK , so a situation like " Bob said he was going to the movies " , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have " I " there .
Turn 866, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 867, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 868, E (Grad): Um , and it 's sort of in an extended function {disfmarker}
Turn 869, C (Professor): So we would have it be in quotes in English .
Turn 870, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 871, B (Grad): Right .
Turn 872, E (Grad): But it 's not perceived as a quotative construction .
Turn 873, F (Grad): Right .
Turn 874, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 875, E (Grad): I mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun , um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing , right ?
Turn 876, C (Professor): OK .
Turn 877, F (Grad): Oh , right . Yeah , that makes sense .
Turn 878, E (Grad): Um , but {disfmarker} uh , that happens to sound like the word for " I " but is actually semantically unrelated to it .
Turn 879, F (Grad): Oh , no !
Turn 880, C (Professor): Oh , good , I love the formali
Turn 881, E (Grad): Um ,
Turn 882, F (Grad): Really ?
Turn 883, E (Grad): Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Turn 884, F (Grad): You 're kidding .
Turn 885, E (Grad): There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . Uh , Mary Dalrymple , uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff .
Turn 886, F (Grad): No , that 's horrible . OK . That 's horrible . {comment} OK .
Turn 887, E (Grad): Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL where , you know , you 're signing and someone says something . And then , you know , so " he say " , and then you sort of do a role shift . And then you sign " I , this , that , and the other " .
Turn 888, F (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 889, E (Grad): And you know , " I did this " . That 's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with " I " . And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on . So , I mean , the point is that pronoun references , uh , you know , sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on , and so forth .
Turn 890, F (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 891, E (Grad): And so , yeah , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 892, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 893, C (Professor): So that {disfmarker} that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah .
Turn 894, E (Grad): Right . Yeah .
Turn 895, F (Grad): OK , so it 's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context . And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever , um , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you 're scope is {disfmarker} m might extend out to the {disfmarker} the base one .
Turn 896, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 897, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 898, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 899, F (Grad): It would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it 'll be one or the other .
Turn 900, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 901, F (Grad): It 's like , oh , actually , it 's the same {disfmarker} same operation .
Turn 902, C (Professor): Oh , OK , so this {disfmarker} this is worth some thought .
Turn 903, F (Grad): So .
Turn 904, E (Grad): It 's like {disfmarker} it 's like what 's happening {disfmarker} that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ?
Turn 905, F (Grad): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 906, E (Grad): So that 's {disfmarker} that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages .
Turn 907, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 908, E (Grad): And so ,
Turn 909, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 910, E (Grad): um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space which can change .
Turn 911, F (Grad): Mm - hmm ,
Turn 912, E (Grad): And we need all the same machinery .
Turn 913, F (Grad): right .
Turn 914, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 915, F (Grad): Robert .
Turn 916, C (Professor): Well , but , uh , this is very good actually
Turn 917, E (Grad): Schade .
Turn 918, C (Professor): cuz it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to the extent that it works , it y
Turn 919, F (Grad): Ties it all into it .
Turn 920, C (Professor): it {disfmarker} it ties together several of {disfmarker} of these things .
Turn 921, F (Grad): Yeah . Yep .
Turn 922, A (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I 'm sure gonna read the transcript of this one . So . But the , uh , {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it 's too bad that we don't have a camera . You know , all the pointing is gonna be lost .
Turn 923, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 924, F (Grad): Oh , yeah .
Turn 925, B (Grad): Well every time Nancy giggles it means {disfmarker} it means that it 's your job .
Turn 926, F (Grad): Yeah , that 's why I said " point to Robert " , {vocalsound} when I did it .
Turn 927, A (Grad): Uh . Yeah . Mmm , isn't {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm {disfmarker} I was sort of dubious why {disfmarker} why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space and then builds up {disfmarker}
Turn 928, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 929, A (Grad): d doesn't start with some {disfmarker} because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , {comment} that whenever I say something I could preface that with " I think . " Nuh ?
Turn 930, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 931, A (Grad): So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue .
Turn 932, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 933, C (Professor): No , but there 's {disfmarker} there 's a Gricean thing going on there , that when you say " I think " you 're actually hedging .
Turn 934, E (Grad): Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 935, F (Grad): Mmm . It 's like I don't totally think {disfmarker}
Turn 936, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 937, E (Grad): Yeah . Y
Turn 938, F (Grad): I mostly think , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 939, A (Grad): Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} Absolutely .
Turn 940, E (Grad): Yeah , it 's an {disfmarker} it 's an evidential . It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . People have talked about it this way . And you know , you can do sort of special things . You can , th put just the phrase " I think " as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth .
Turn 941, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 942, E (Grad): So {disfmarker}
Turn 943, F (Grad): Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it 's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that .
Turn 944, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 945, F (Grad): So .
Turn 946, A (Grad): Yeah , but about linguistic hedges , I mean , those {disfmarker} those tend to be , um , funky anyways because they blur {disfmarker}
Turn 947, C (Professor): So we don't have that in here either do we ?
Turn 948, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 949, F (Grad): Hedges ?
Turn 950, C (Professor): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 951, F (Grad): Hhh , {comment} I {disfmarker} there used to be a slot for speaker , um , it was something like factivity . I couldn't really remember what it meant
Turn 952, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 953, F (Grad): so I took it out .
Turn 954, E (Grad): Um .
Turn 955, F (Grad): But it 's something {disfmarker}
Turn 956, E (Grad): Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ?
Turn 957, F (Grad): we {disfmarker} we were talking about sarcasm too , right ? Oh , oh .
Turn 958, E (Grad): I mean ,
Turn 959, F (Grad): Oh , yeah , yeah , right .
Turn 960, E (Grad): that 's what I think is , um , sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this
Turn 961, C (Professor): So we probably should .
Turn 962, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 963, A (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 964, E (Grad): or the , you know {disfmarker}
Turn 965, C (Professor): Confidence or something like that .
Turn 966, E (Grad): Yeah , and the fact that I 'm , you know {disfmarker} the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever ,
Turn 967, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 968, A (Grad): Uh great word in the English language is called " about " .
Turn 969, E (Grad): you know {disfmarker}
Turn 970, A (Grad): If you study how people use that it 's also {disfmarker}
Turn 971, F (Grad): What 's the word ?
Turn 972, A (Grad): " about . " It 's about {disfmarker}
Turn 973, C (Professor): About .
Turn 974, A (Grad): clever .
Turn 975, C (Professor): Oh , that {disfmarker} in that use of " about " , yeah .
Turn 976, F (Grad): Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge .
Turn 977, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 978, C (Professor): And I think {disfmarker} And I think {pause} y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that .
Turn 979, E (Grad): He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one .
Turn 980, B (Grad): I r I read that paper ,
Turn 981, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 982, B (Grad): the hedges paper ? I read some of that paper actually .
Turn 983, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 984, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 985, E (Grad): Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ?
Turn 986, F (Grad): What ?
Turn 987, C (Professor): No .
Turn 988, E (Grad): Ask me about it later I 'll tell you how . When we 're not on tape .
Turn 989, F (Grad): I 'd love to know .
Turn 990, B (Grad): Oh , man .
Turn 991, F (Grad): So , and {disfmarker} and I think , uh , someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point .
Turn 992, C (Professor): There 's all that stuff . Yeah , let 's {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Turn 993, F (Grad): And we just won't deal with sarcastic people .
Turn 994, C (Professor): Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}
Turn 995, E (Grad): I don't really know what like {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? Like there 's not so many different {disfmarker} hhh , {comment} I don't know , m
Turn 996, F (Grad): Certainly not as some {disfmarker} Well , they 're intonational markers I think for the most part .
Turn 997, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 998, F (Grad): I don't know too much about the like grammatical {disfmarker}
Turn 999, E (Grad): I just mean {disfmarker} There 's lots of different attitudes that {disfmarker} that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth .
Turn 1000, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1001, E (Grad): But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ?
Turn 1002, C (Professor): Right . Right , so , uh , this {disfmarker} this raises the question of what are our current purposes .
Turn 1003, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1004, C (Professor): Right ?
Turn 1005, E (Grad): Oh , shoot .
Turn 1006, F (Grad): Oh , yeah , do we have any ?
Turn 1007, E (Grad): Here it is three - fifteen already .
Turn 1008, A (Grad): Mmm . Yeah .
Turn 1009, C (Professor): Uh , so , um , I {disfmarker} I don't know the answer but {disfmarker} but , um , it does seem that , you know , this is {disfmarker} this is coming along . I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's converging . It 's {disfmarker} as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental {disfmarker} the whole s mental space thing . And then there 's some other minor things .
Turn 1010, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1011, C (Professor): Um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . I mean , if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know , w we 'll go nuts .
Turn 1012, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1013, C (Professor): So we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d you know , there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} God knows , irony , and stuff like {disfmarker} which you {disfmarker} isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide .
Turn 1014, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1015, C (Professor): Yeah ?
Turn 1016, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1017, C (Professor): Uh .
Turn 1018, F (Grad): M mockery .
Turn 1019, C (Professor): Right . Whatever . So y uh , no end of things th that {disfmarker} that , you know , we don't deal with .
Turn 1020, A (Grad): But it {disfmarker}
Turn 1021, C (Professor): And {disfmarker}
Turn 1022, A (Grad): i isn't that part easy though
Turn 1023, C (Professor): Go ahead .
Turn 1024, A (Grad): because in terms of the s simspec , it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it , and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony
Turn 1025, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1026, C (Professor): N no .
Turn 1027, F (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1028, A (Grad): or {disfmarker}
Turn 1029, C (Professor): No .
Turn 1030, E (Grad): Right .
Turn 1031, F (Grad): Maybe .
Turn 1032, C (Professor): No .
Turn 1033, F (Grad): Yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like " speaker believes not - P " , you know ?
Turn 1034, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1035, F (Grad): Like " the speaker says P and believes not - P " .
Turn 1036, E (Grad): We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now .
Turn 1037, F (Grad): But {disfmarker}
Turn 1038, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1039, E (Grad): Yeah , right , I mean .
Turn 1040, C (Professor): No , no .
Turn 1041, F (Grad): Right , right , but ,
Turn 1042, C (Professor): Anyway , so {disfmarker} so , um , I guess uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , which is that , um , it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n
Turn 1043, E (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1044, C (Professor): don't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have .
Turn 1045, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1046, C (Professor): Uh , and then when Robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them .
Turn 1047, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1048, C (Professor): Just {disfmarker} just sort of , you know , define your space .
Turn 1049, E (Grad): Yeah , OK .
Turn 1050, C (Professor): And , um , so th these are {disfmarker} this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with .
Turn 1051, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1052, C (Professor): And then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go back over it and w people will {disfmarker} will give feedback on it .
Turn 1053, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1054, C (Professor): And then {disfmarker} then we 'll have a {disfmarker} at least initial spec of {disfmarker} of what we 're actually trying to do .
Turn 1055, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1056, C (Professor): And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser .
Turn 1057, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1058, C (Professor): Knowing uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1059, E (Grad): In case there 's any around .
Turn 1060, F (Grad): If we knew anybody like that .
Turn 1061, C (Professor): Right , " who might want " et cetera . So , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1062, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1063, C (Professor): So a and we get this {disfmarker} this , uh , portals fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to , uh , do your set of {disfmarker} but you have to do that anyway .
Turn 1064, F (Grad): For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm .
Turn 1065, C (Professor): So {disfmarker} so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and the {disfmarker} and the child language learning .
Turn 1066, B (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1067, C (Professor): And we 'll see what we need for those two . And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've {disfmarker} we really want to get done .
Turn 1068, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1069, C (Professor): And then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and {disfmarker} and all that .
Turn 1070, E (Grad): Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Turn 1071, A (Grad): Well , I also think the detailed discussion will hit {disfmarker} you know , bring us to problems that are of a general nature and maybe even {disfmarker}
Turn 1072, C (Professor): Uh , without doubt . Yeah .
Turn 1073, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1074, A (Grad): even suggest some solutions .
Turn 1075, C (Professor): But what I want to do is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is to {disfmarker} to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for .
Turn 1076, A (Grad): Yeah . Mmm .
Turn 1077, C (Professor): So that {disfmarker} that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer
Turn 1078, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1079, C (Professor): and other things we 'll put on a list of {disfmarker} of research problems or something , because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something you say , " oh , yeah , but what about this case ? "
Turn 1080, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1081, C (Professor): This is {disfmarker} this is called being a linguist .
Turn 1082, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1083, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1084, C (Professor): And , uh ,
Turn 1085, E (Grad): Basically .
Turn 1086, F (Grad): Or me .
Turn 1087, C (Professor): Huh ?
Turn 1088, F (Grad): Or me . Anyways {disfmarker}
Turn 1089, B (Grad): There 's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where {disfmarker} where it goes {disfmarker} where some guy goes , " every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . "
Turn 1090, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1091, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1092, E (Grad): Exactly .
Turn 1093, C (Professor): Right . But anyway . So , is {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} does that make sense as a , uh {disfmarker} a general way to proceed ?
Turn 1094, F (Grad): Sure , yeah .
Turn 1095, E (Grad): Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , just figuring out what needs to be done then actually the next step is to start trying to do it .
Turn 1096, C (Professor): Exactly right .
Turn 1097, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1098, E (Grad): Got it .
Turn 1099, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1100, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1101, A (Grad): We have a little bit of news , uh , just minor stuff . The one big {disfmarker}
Turn 1102, B (Grad): Ooo , can I ask a {disfmarker}
Turn 1103, E (Grad): You ran out of power .
Turn 1104, A (Grad): Huh ?
Turn 1105, B (Grad): Can I ask a quick question about this side ?
Turn 1106, A (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1107, F (Grad): Yes .
Turn 1108, B (Grad): Is this , uh {disfmarker} was it intentional to leave off things like " inherits " and {disfmarker}
Turn 1109, F (Grad): Oops . Um ,
Turn 1110, E (Grad): No .
Turn 1111, F (Grad): not really {disfmarker} just on the constructions , right ?
Turn 1112, B (Grad): Yeah , like constructions can inherit from other things ,
Turn 1113, F (Grad): Um ,
Turn 1114, B (Grad): am I right ?
Turn 1115, F (Grad): yeah .
Turn 1116, B (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1117, F (Grad): I didn't want to think too much about that for {disfmarker} for now .
Turn 1118, B (Grad): OK .
Turn 1119, C (Professor): Yeah .
Turn 1120, F (Grad): So , uh , maybe it was subconsciously intentional .
Turn 1121, C (Professor): Yeah , uh {disfmarker} yeah .
Turn 1122, E (Grad): Um , yeah , there should be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance ,
Turn 1123, C (Professor): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1124, E (Grad): where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents ,
Turn 1125, F (Grad): Uh - huh . Yep .
Turn 1126, E (Grad): uh , or different ones , or three or four different ones .
Turn 1127, C (Professor): Yeah . So let me {disfmarker}
Turn 1128, E (Grad): Cuz the problem is that then you have to {disfmarker}
Turn 1129, F (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1130, E (Grad): which of {disfmarker} you know , which are {disfmarker} how they 're getting bound together .
Turn 1131, F (Grad): Refer to {pause} them .
Turn 1132, C (Professor): Yeah , right , right , right . Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Turn 1133, F (Grad): Yeah , and {disfmarker} and there are certainly cases like that . Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples .
Turn 1134, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1135, F (Grad): So , and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway .
Turn 1136, C (Professor): Yeah . So what I would like to do is separate that problem out .
Turn 1137, F (Grad): Inherits .
Turn 1138, C (Professor): So um ,
Turn 1139, E (Grad): OK .
Turn 1140, C (Professor): my argument is there 's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions .
Turn 1141, E (Grad): Yeah , yes .
Turn 1142, C (Professor): It 's uglier and it d doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff .
Turn 1143, E (Grad): That 's right .
Turn 1144, C (Professor): Uh ,
Turn 1145, E (Grad): But whatever .
Turn 1146, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1147, E (Grad): Yeah , no , no , no no .
Turn 1148, F (Grad): Uh , those are over rated .
Turn 1149, E (Grad): No , by all means ,
Turn 1150, C (Professor): And so I {disfmarker} what I 'd like to do is {disfmarker} is in the short run focus on getting it right .
Turn 1151, E (Grad): right . Uh , sure .
Turn 1152, C (Professor): And when we think we have it right then saying , " aha ! ,
Turn 1153, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1154, C (Professor): can we make it more elegant ? "
Turn 1155, E (Grad): Yeah , that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1156, C (Professor): Can {disfmarker} can we , uh {disfmarker} What are the generalizations , and stuff ?
Turn 1157, E (Grad): Yeah . Connect the dots . Yeah .
Turn 1158, C (Professor): But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing .
Turn 1159, E (Grad): Yep . Yeah .
Turn 1160, C (Professor): So I would say in the short run we 're not gonna b
Turn 1161, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1162, C (Professor): First of all , we 're not doing them yet at all . And {disfmarker} and it could be that half way through we say , " aha ! , we {disfmarker} we now see how we want to clean it up . "
Turn 1163, E (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1164, C (Professor): Uh , and inheritance is only one {disfmarker} I mean , that 's one way to organize it but there are others . And it may or may not be the best way .
Turn 1165, E (Grad): Yeah .
Turn 1166, A (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1167, C (Professor): I 'm sorry , you had news .
Turn 1168, A (Grad): Oh , just small stuff . Um , thanks to Eva on our web site we can now , if you want to run JavaBayes , uh , you could see {disfmarker} get {disfmarker} download these classes . And then it will enable you {disfmarker} she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format .
Turn 1169, D (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1170, B (Grad): Mmm .
Turn 1171, A (Grad): So that 's wonderful .
Turn 1172, C (Professor): Great .
Turn 1173, A (Grad): And , um and she , a You tested it out . Do you want to say something about that , that it works , right ? With the {disfmarker}
Turn 1174, D (Grad): I was just checking like , when we wanna , um , get the posterior probability of , like , variables . You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? You can't .
Turn 1175, A (Grad): Uh - huh .
Turn 1176, D (Grad): You have to make separate queries every time .
Turn 1177, A (Grad): OK , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a bit unfortunate
Turn 1178, D (Grad): So {disfmarker} Yeah .
Turn 1179, A (Grad): but for the time being it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's fine to do it {disfmarker}
Turn 1180, D (Grad): You just have to have a long list of , you know , all the variables .
Turn 1181, A (Grad): Yeah . But uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1182, D (Grad): Basically .
Turn 1183, F (Grad): Uh , all the things you want to query , you just have to like ask for separately .
Turn 1184, D (Grad): Yeah , yeah .
Turn 1185, A (Grad): Well that 's {disfmarker} probably maybe in the long term that 's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how {disfmarker} how we want to get an out output . Um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time . And , um , I don't know . We 're really running late , so I had , uh , an idea yesterday but , uh , I don't know whether we should even start discussing .
Turn 1186, C (Professor): W what {disfmarker} Yeah , sure , tell us what it is .
Turn 1187, A (Grad): Um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but hasn't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows . I thought that we would , uh {disfmarker} that the following thing would be in incredibly nice and I have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing . So that 's just a tangent , a couple of mental disclaimers here . Um , imagine you {disfmarker} you write a Bayes - net , um {disfmarker}
Turn 1188, F (Grad): Bayes ?
Turn 1189, A (Grad): Bayes - net ,
Turn 1190, F (Grad): OK .
Turn 1191, A (Grad): um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . So you have nothing . Just a white piece of paper .
Turn 1192, C (Professor): Mmm , right .
Turn 1193, A (Grad): You consult {disfmarker} consult your ontology which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh
Turn 1194, F (Grad): Grout out the things that {disfmarker} that you need .
Turn 1195, C (Professor): Right .
Turn 1196, A (Grad): then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into {disfmarker} onto your {disfmarker} your white piece of paper . And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there . You won't get {disfmarker} you won't really get any C P T 's , therefore we need everything that {disfmarker} that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model .
Turn 1197, F (Grad): Mm - hmm .
Turn 1198, A (Grad): And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the {disfmarker} the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you {disfmarker} we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the {disfmarker} the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be {disfmarker} can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the initial notes . But it 's {disfmarker} in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , {vocalsound} that 'd be kind of funky .
Turn 1199, C (Professor): Um , it sounds to me like you want P R
Turn 1200, A (Grad): P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net {disfmarker}
Turn 1201, C (Professor): Beca - because it {disfmarker} b because {disfmarker} No , no , you can't . See the {disfmarker} the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can {disfmarker} then you can unfold it .
Turn 1202, A (Grad): Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In {disfmarker}
Turn 1203, C (Professor): Well , no , but it matters a lot because you {disfmarker} what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case .
Turn 1204, A (Grad): And then {disfmarker} then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the {disfmarker} the way {disfmarker} the only way it works .
Turn 1205, C (Professor): Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker}
Turn 1206, A (Grad): 
Turn 1207, C (Professor): Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have to see .
Turn 1208, A (Grad): But , uh ,
Turn 1209, C (Professor): Uh {disfmarker} Yes . This is {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh {disfmarker}
Turn 1210, A (Grad): Except there 's no {disfmarker} no theorem prover involved .
Turn 1211, F (Grad): Best explanation .
