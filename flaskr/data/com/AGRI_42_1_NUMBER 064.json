Good morning, everyone.\n              My name is Dr. Harpreet Kochhar. I am the acting vice-president of operations at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and chief veterinary officer for Canada, as well as the delegate for Canada to the World Organisation for Animal Health. \n              \n              I am happy to have the opportunity to participate in this study, and I would like to explain the CFIA's role with respect to porcine epidemic diarrhea.\n              The CFIA is a science-based regulatory agency dedicated to safeguarding plants, animals and food. Our work promotes the health and well-being of Canada's people, environment and economy. Its main priority is the health and safety of Canadians. \n              \n               First of all, let me assure you that Canada's animal health and food safety system remains among the best in the world. Porcine epidemic diarrhea is not a food safety risk. It does not pose a threat to human health. However, it is a disease that can limit pork production. This is because PED, as it is commonly called, can cause a significant number of deaths in very young piglets. \n              PED is not a federally reportable disease or federally regulated disease in Canada. However, this disease is regulated in some provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, and Ontario, and suspected cases of PED are reported to provincial authorities. \n              PED is typically transmitted from one infected pig to another. In addition to direct contact with sick animals, the PED virus can be spread through people's clothing, boots, equipment, and other items contaminated with feces of infected animals. That is why any item that comes into contact with a sick animal should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. \n              The first case of PED in Canada on a swine farm was confirmed by the CFIA on January 24, 2014, in Ontario. Since then, PED has also been reported in Manitoba, Quebec and Prince Edward Island. Following that initial detection of PED in Canada, the CFIA has engaged and worked collaboratively with provincial and industry stakeholders to provide technical, diagnostic, and scientific support when needed or requested. \n              Mr. Chairman, there's a vaccine for the PED virus. To help industry respond to the threat posed by PED, the CFIA began issuing permits to allow veterinarians to import this vaccine for use in Canadian herds in 2014. Swine producers who are interested in vaccinating their herds should contact their veterinarians, because this vaccine is available. Under the leadership of the chief veterinary officer of Canada—my office—the CFIA regularly engages and works collaboratively with our provincial counterparts and industry stakeholders to facilitate a coordinated approach to this disease.\n              Mr. Chairman, four new cases of PED have been reported in Ontario in 2017. This brings the total to 103 cases in Ontario since the initial PED outbreak in 2014. In Manitoba there have been a total of 27 PED cases—the count is still out—since the initial outbreak in 2014, with 18 of them being reported this year.\n              As in the past, Manitoba's Department of Agriculture is the lead organization for the response to the most recent cases of PED in that province and is being supported by the pork industry. To address the current cases, Manitoba Agriculture and the Manitoba Pork Council are following the normal PED response protocol. The CFIA does play an active supporting role. The agency is monitoring the situation closely and communicating with Manitoba's chief veterinary officer. \n              The CFIA, Mr. Chairman, is also responsible for technical negotiations and for answering queries from any international trade partners with respect to PED so that we can maintain our market access. The CFIA currently requires pig transport trucks returning from a specific type of location in the United States to be cleaned and disinfected before entering Canada. This requirement reduces the risk of pig diseases being brought into Canada, including PED, which is widespread in the U.S. \n              \n              \n              It is important to note that, at this time, there is no confirmed link between the current PED cases in Manitoba and trucks coming back from the U.S. We understand that Manitoba continues its investigation into potential sources of infection.\n              \n              Adequate biosecurity measures remain the first and best line of defence for pork producers to prevent introduction and spread of the PED virus. The CFIA will continue to assist with any monitoring, diagnostic and technical support, as needed.\n              \n              We are also looking towards the future. We want to ensure we have very effective and efficient transportation protocols in place to protect livestock.\n              We have initiated discussions around transportation protocols to protect Canadian animals with a particular focus on truck washing.\n              \n               Officials of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will be sitting down with their provincial counterparts over the coming months to explore potential solutions related to washing trucks that cross the border.\n              \n              Thank you again for this opportunity to provide insight into the CFIA's role regarding porcine epidemic diarrhea.\n              \n              Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."}, {"turn": 5, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you very much, Dr. Kochhar.\n               That is the statement from the CFIA.\n              Mr. Dickson, perhaps you could give us an opening statement."}, {"turn": 6, "speakerID": "108444", "name": "Mr. Andrew Dickson (General Manager, Manitoba Pork Council)", "contribution": "I shared a copy of my presentation with the clerk earlier and I welcome this opportunity to address the committee. We appreciate the time and effort you're taking to meet with us and talk about this very serious disease.\n              I'm not going to go through all the details in my paper, but I'll try to highlight some things.\n              I want to emphasize what the CFIA just said here and to the media, and so on. PEDv is a disease of animals. It does not spread to human beings. It's not a food issue. We don't want people thinking they shouldn't be eating their pork chops, and so on. This is basically a disease, in the worst case, of baby pigs. Unfortunately, the mortality rate is between 80% and 100%. Essentially, the animals die of dehydration after very bad diarrhea.\n              The herd in Canada is essentially naive. That means there's no natural immunity to this. We don't have any antibiotics or treatment systems. The animals essentially die, and we have to deal with sick animals. Most of the older animals will recover. We're able to bring animals to the point of non-shedding, and so on, so they can be marketed.\n               Manitoba is the gateway to the west. We have about 340,000 sows in the province. We produce about 8 million pigs. We ship about 3 million or so to the United States and send the finished pigs—these are the big pigs—to processing plants in Manitoba. They're a big employer in the province, accounting for about 13,000 jobs, and so on. It's a critical industry.\n              The other thing is that we're connected directly, because of integration—it's a modern industry—with Saskatchewan and Alberta. When you think about it as a western Canada issue, we now have half the Canadian herd potentially affected by this disease. Because we ship so many weanlings to the United States, we're highly integrated into the U.S. pig production system. This disease has now become endemic in the United States.\n              We also differ from other parts of the country in that our barns are much larger than what you'll find in Ontario and Quebec, especially Ontario. We have 80 barns that house 80% of our sows. These are big operations. That has all kinds of implications for how we manage this disease, because it means there are large numbers of animals moving at any one moment in time between large operations.\n              We have a three-site system. We essentially have sow barns, nursery barns, and finisher barns. The three-site system was designed to try to minimize the amount of disease.\n              In 2013 this disease became endemic in the United States, or spread very rapidly. They had 300 cases a week, that sort of thing. They lost about 10 million pigs. No one really knows the real number. It had a major impact on their production and changed the market price. There was a shortage of pigs.\n              In Manitoba, prior to that we had engaged in a very in-depth upgrading of the biosecurity on our farms. We did extensive training with all producers and upgraded all our facilities on farms. There was special assistance from the federal government and the province through support programs to make this happen. Our industry, in turn, also upgraded things, like our wash stations, and so on. We have commercial-size livestock trailer washing operations, which are way ahead of any standard in North America.\n              Our board, when it saw this disease arrive, decided that we would aggressively prevent and eradicate any disease of this type entering into Manitoba. We've been very aggressive. We had 10 cases from 2014 to 2016 and were able to contain them. Nine of those cases have now been cleaned up, and one is almost at the point of being cleaned up.\n              Unfortunately, in 2017, since the beginning of May.... As of this morning we have two more cases, and we're up to about 22 cases now. These are all large operations. We're talking about 5,000 sows, large-scale nurseries with a capacity of 20,000, and so on.\n              In the paper I've described the measures we have taken. They're not pleasant; they're very hard on staff. We are running into problems in being able to contain this disease, to eradicate it, and to prevent it. There are specialized crews doing the washing. There are specialized crews doing the manure application because of the disease. In terms of the cases we now have, these 22, we're talking about 60 million gallons of liquid manure that is going to be diseased and that we have to dispose of and put on our farmland as fertilizer. We have to make sure that doesn't spread to other barns.\n              When you think about it, a thimble full of this disease could infect all the herd in western Canada. So we have some issues here that we have to deal with. Fortunately, in nature, the disease will degrade. If we can just get some breaks, some time here to let the barns settle down, the pigs will become non-shedding and we can get on top of this. \n              \n              Regarding this trailer thing with the U.S., we have about 100 trailers a week go through the Emerson port of entry hauling pigs to the United States. \n              In 2014, we had a special pilot project to try to have those trailers that were going into the United States tagged at the border on their return and to go to these new, modern wash stations where we could probably clean and disinfect these things and prevent any contamination from the U.S. getting into the trailers. \n              What I want to portray here is that these trailers are like a little piece of Canada that goes across the border onto a U.S. farm. The pigs are chased out through a ramp into the feeder operation, and the doors are closed. We deliberately make sure there's no contamination of diseases from the United States getting into the trailer. We want to preserve that trailer—still a little piece of Canada—bring it across the border and clean it up in Canada, where we're able to contain the disease. \n              The disease is endemic in the United States. It's in all these wash stations. There is no certification process in the United States. We've met with their state veterinarians, and there is no regulation of their wash stations, and so on. \n              We, in Manitoba, can do that. We have the regulatory authority to enter into a trusted trucker program. We can certify these stations. \n              We're hoping that we can work something out with CFIA, as announced here. I want to emphasize that we're the gateway to western Canada. The other provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, are incredibly nervous about what's happening here. I was in Edmonton on Monday meeting with their councils, giving them an update of what's happening, and they're looking to us to try to get this thing contained and eradicated."}, {"turn": 7, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Mr. Dickson, if you could conclude, there will be lots of questions, and you can probably...."}, {"turn": 8, "speakerID": "108444", "name": "Mr. Andrew Dickson", "contribution": "In the end, we need some assistance from the CFIA to beef up our CVO's office, in terms of staff and technical help. \n              We need some financial help with producers for the cleanup. We're looking at $200,000 per operation to try to clean these things up. We would appreciate some help from some level of government on this thing, especially for the crews that we need for the washing and the manure application. \n              Then there's some long-term stuff about how we get assembly yards out of these areas, how we provide some financial assistance to producers in the long term to recover financially from their operations, and whether there could be some flexibility in the regulations.\n              The key one I want to go back to is this. Can we do something about the trucker program, just to try to prevent the disease from coming into Canada? We're offering it as a model for the rest of the country."}, {"turn": 9, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you so much for your opening remarks.\n              We'll start a round of questions with Mr. Anderson for six minutes."}, {"turn": 10, "speakerID": "224986", "name": "Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, CPC)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair, I'm going to share my time with Mr. Maguire.\n              I first want to acknowledge that the committee has worked well together.

I just want to recognize that we've gotten a great response from the committee members and a willingness to be able to hear about these on TV. \n              We got a response from the government because of our hearings.

I appreciate the members' indulgence on this. This is a very important issue, not just in Manitoba specifically, as it's in southeast Manitoba right now, but for Canada. \n              Fortunately, we've been able to contain it in the other areas of Canada where it has come up before, and we need to be able to move quickly, if we can, to do whatever we can on this. I appreciate the CFIA and Manitoba Pork Council's being here this morning to make presentations. \n              Thank you very much. \n              There was one area, Mr. Kochhar, that I was wondering about. You mentioned that there was no tie to the American situation with the trucks coming back into Canada, that there was no science, no proof of that causing the present disease. What then do you think has caused this present situation that we're in?"}, {"turn": 12, "speakerID": "233315", "name": "Dr. Harpreet Kochhar", "contribution": "Mr. Chairman, in response to that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there are multiple factors that can cause the disease to happen. One of them would be the transport trucks. Others are animal movement, breach in biosecurity, human movement, and equipment movement, so there are multiple ways to transmit this.\n              There has not been any specific line of inquiry that points to any a specific aspect or line for how the disease got in or how it has been prevailing in Manitoba. What we are trying to do, as I mentioned, is to help the Manitoba government through the CVO's office. \n              My office is working very much in connection with them, and we've offered technical support. We are actually testing the feed samples and the other samples. We are also providing them with experts in epidemiology who are assisting them to find out. This is one of those situations where you will have to look at all the different pieces and try to piece them together to see what exactly it could have been. Was it a breach in biosecurity or, as mentioned, could it have been from a trailer program?"}, {"turn": 13, "speakerID": "218418", "name": "Mr. Larry Maguire (Brandon—Souris, CPC)", "contribution": "Thank you very much.\n              You mentioned a number of things that it could be. Eliminating one of them would be very helpful. To my understanding, we should reinstate the Manitoba protocol with regard to truck washing—sealed in Manitoba, and washed at the earliest convenience in Manitoba.\n              I like the analogy used by Mr. Dickson with regard to the little chunk of Canada that goes down to the States, unloads the pigs, and comes back. It's very clear that we can control this. From my understanding, there are no regulations on American truck washing on that side, and we're washing in a contaminated country.\n              Why don't we bring those trucks back into Canada sealed and wash them locally at the nearest area? I wonder if you could both reply to that. Continue the protocol until we at least.... Maybe it's one thing we could eliminate. I ask for your indulgence on that."}, {"turn": 14, "speakerID": "233315", "name": "Dr. Harpreet Kochhar", "contribution": "Mr. Chairman, if I may.\n              First and foremost, one of the things we were given was an exemption from the health of animals regulations for an interim period so that we could evaluate the washing of the trucks in the U.S. Is it ineffective or perpetuating the disease? The science tells us this virus is very fragile. If exposed to 60°C, it will lose its ability to be infectious.\n              Washing the truck with warm or hot water and using a disinfectant would absolutely make sure there is very little if any virus. There is never going to be zero risk, Mr. Chair, but we would substantially reduce the amount of any contamination there.\n              That protocol was instituted as an exemption. We re-evaluated it, shared the science, and in October 2015 we said that we would slowly be taking it to the point where we could enforce it in six months' time. In May 2016, we completely eliminated it.\n              If you look at the current enrolment, I don't think anything stood out. We're still doing some EPI or epidemiological analysis on whether there is any connection between the transport truck wash and the disease appearing in Manitoba.\n              Until now, that has been the case."}, {"turn": 15, "speakerID": "218418", "name": "Mr. Larry Maguire (Brandon—Souris, CPC)", "contribution": "How quickly could we implement that again if we needed to put it back in place?"}, {"turn": 16, "speakerID": "233316", "name": "Ms. Barbara Jordan (Acting Vice-President, Policy and Programs Branch, Canadian Food Inspection Agency)", "contribution": "We could do it very quickly.

National biosecurity standards and guidelines have been developed, and they have been effectively using them to control and eradicate the disease.

They sit on our board of directors, and we consult all the time. It's an integrated industry. We meet as an industry. You'll hear from HyLife today about how they are trying to get on top of this disease. Maple Leaf is the same way. It's one of these “But for the grace of God, they don't have a whole pile of barns infected yet.” They are very worried about the impact. This loss of baby pigs at some point is going to affect the processing capacity of the plant in Brandon, and the same applies to the plants in.... OlyWest has plants in Alberta. They are worried about where this will show up at some point, if we start losing baby pigs.\n              My understanding is that in Ontario—and I may be unclear on this—when they report a case, it tends to be a number of barns. One case can be two or three barns, or a single barn, depending on the type of system. In Manitoba, we report every barn as a separate case on its own, because essentially they're very large.\n              The other thing I should point out is the structure of the industry in Ontario. They've gone to this three-site system, but a lot of barns are still farrow-to-nursery, farrow-to-finish, and so on, so the number of movements within their system is actually reduced.

I was also the chief veterinarian of Saskatchewan during the H1N1 crisis in 2009.\n              Maple Leaf is the largest animal protein company in Canada, and we have a significant pork presence in western Canada. In Manitoba, we have over 200 barns. Annually, we own 1.5 million pigs, and we process close to 4 million pigs in Canada. Biosecurity, animal health, food security, our economic health, and our trade status are very important to Maple Leaf.\n              What I have seen in this situation, as a former chief veterinary officer who worked closely with the CFIA and the office of the chief veterinary officer for Canada is a lack of collaboration, communication, and transparency in dealing with this outbreak. We've seen that information isn't being transmitted quickly. The federal government isn't as engaged as they should be. It was encouraging to hear Dr. Harpreet talk about providing epidemiological support, some testing support, and some biosecurity resources, but more is required.\n              This disease, PED, is eligible to be a regulated disease in Canada by most measures. The OIE has suggested that both Canada and the U.S. must report PED to the world authorities, and other countries that we deal with ask about our PED status. So, in fact, the notion that it's merely a provincially regulated disease isn't necessarily a very good argument.\n              I was encouraged to hear Andrew Dickson's comments. I think what we're seeing in Manitoba is a situation where producers aren't being attentive to biosecurity, to cleaning and disinfection, and to being proactive before they're spreading the disease and moving animals. The only way we can get ahead of this is the same way we did in Ontario. We often had town halls, communications between producers, and provided them all kinds of support with biosecurity, information, and technical support at the farms. We worked closely with our processors to stream healthy animals through to the processing system. It will be critical that we work together.\n              Vaccines have not been shown to be efficacious quite yet. There are some that might be in the pipeline shortly, and I'm glad to hear Dr. Kochhar talk about their availability. It will be critical in the coming months that we work together, that more resources be available both at the human level and maybe the monetary level, and that people be more engaged than they have been if we're going to get ahead of this disease. As Mr. Dickson suggested, a lot is at stake going into fall and winter of 2017 with our partners in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and also across the country.\n              We were successful in Ontario because we worked together. We didn't understand the complete situation coming from the U.S., but we worked with our producers. Our producers were engaged, they made good decisions, and they were responsible. Until that happens in Manitoba, we'll continue to be frustrated.\n              I think that's all I have to say for now."}, {"turn": 80, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Douglas.\n              Now we'll go to Mr. Pearce, for five minutes."}, {"turn": 81, "speakerID": "233321", "name": "Mr. Quintin Pearce (General Manager, P. Quintaine & Son Ltd.)", "contribution": "Good afternoon. My name is Quintin Pearce. I am the general manager of P. Quintaine & Son Ltd. We are livestock order buyers that procure sows and boars from western Canada. \n              We are a Canadian family-owned business that has been operating since 1968. We have a buying station in Red Deer, Alberta, and two buying stations in Manitoba. We have grown our business from a small, single-person operation to the largest Canadian buyer of cull sows and boars in Canada. \n              From our assembly yards to truck fleet, safe, humane handling and transportation is at the highest level of importance. Biosecurity and biocontainment have become a very important part of our business. Gone are the days when sows and boars were raised in outdoor pens. The swine industry has consolidated and become a concentrated and efficient industry. As with any living thing, large concentrations of animals will result in easier transmission of disease. This is managed by good veterinary staff, and engaged and educated barn staff, with proven processes. This results in a production system that provides high-quality pork to Canada and the world at a reasonable cost. \n              We are very concerned about the recent outbreaks of the PEDv virus. PEDv is of great concern and has the potential to affect domestic and export sales. It is a huge impact on the infected farms and businesses that we work with. We have and will continue to work with all levels of government to lessen the viral load that is currently in the infected areas, and we will do what is required to keep the virus out of western Canada. \n              As we export our purchased sows and boars to the United States, we have opted to continue to wash and disinfect, in approved washing facilities, at our own cost, all equipment returning to Canada. We are audited routinely by federal, provincial, and third-party U.S. packer-approved auditors. We have worked with all levels of government and have received funding from Growing Forward to enhance our biosecurity and biocontainment levels. \n              I am asking the audience gathered here to work together, as I am working with all levels of government, veterinarian, and regulatory bodies. We can and should learn from those who have been previously infected. Collaboration is key, and time is of the essence."}, {"turn": 82, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Pearce.\n              Now, Mr. Vielfaure."}, {"turn": 83, "speakerID": "233320", "name": "Mr. Claude Vielfaure (President, HyLife Limited)", "contribution": "Mr. Chair and committee members, thank you for giving us the time to present today.\n              My name is Claude Vielfaure. I am president of HyLife.\n              HyLife was founded in 1994 as a joint venture of two families and has quickly grown to become Canada's leading pork producer, producing 1.9 million hogs annually in Canada and the United States. We have live production facilities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota.\n              HyLife is a global exporter of pork products worldwide, with the head office in La Broquerie, Manitoba. HyLife also has international offices in Japan, China, Mexico, and the United States. We own a processing facility that processes 1.7 million hogs a year. We currently employ 1,900 people across Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and across the company.\n              Our operations are vertically structured to encompass all facets of hog production, including wash facilities and baking bays, which we've invested $1.5 million into in the last two years because of PED and in trying to get better biosecurity.\n              We have feed mill facilities. We have transportation fleets for movement of feed and livestock. We have a construction company, a manure management company that applies manure according to government regulations, and a manufacturing and distribution centre for farm supplies.\n              You have had some education already on PED, but certainly our production system is three-site production. We have maternities; the piglets are born there. We move them to a nursery site, which is a second site. Then we move them to a finishing site, which is where we raise them to market hogs. Certainly, PED affects all sites and creates lots of virus shedding that reinfects barns in the area, which has been a huge concern of ours. It causes mortality in piglets, as we've heard today.\n              One important thing to say again is that PED cannot be transmitted to humans or contaminate the human food supply. Let's be clear on that.\n               As of yesterday, when I had done my presentation, we had 28 outbreaks. Unfortunately, there were two more last night and probably two more were confirmed this morning, so we're at 32.\n               HyLife has been affected severely by PED in the last month. We have three sow sites, including 7,000 sows; nursery sites, with 25,000 spaces; and finishing sites of 40,000 spaces. So we have 72,000 spaces and 11 sites that have been affected in the last month. It's been a struggle.\n              Regarding biosecurity challenges, in the past we have been able to control PED outbreaks at our sites. We had one last year. We were very successful in quickly eradicating the disease. However, this year the virus is spreading faster and is more widespread, which has created a lot of virus shedding and has impacted surrounding sites at an alarming rate.\n              Although we are maintaining strong biosecurity protocols, in most instances, we believe the virus is being spread not by direct link to pig movements, but by air. There have been signs that show the virus does now spread by air. We've actually put some fences between some sites to see. When the wind was blowing, we swabbed the fence and saw that the fence was contaminated with PED. The only way that could have happened was by air. Unfortunately, that's hard to control.\n              In terms of containment strategies, extra measures are currently being taken to try to contain the spread of the disease by dedicating personnel and equipment to positive sites, for example, livestock trucks and feed trucks. This has caused a lot of challenges within the company to ensure that we have enough equipment dedicated to positive sites to prevent the spread of the disease.\n              We have enhanced communication strategies to all staff throughout our organization to elevate the biosecurity protocols to educate our staff and to express the associated risks with the disease.\n              We've had great support from the chief veterinary office in Manitoba. They are putting five-kilometre buffer zones around the sites that become positive. They do weekly testing, and we are on top of all the positive sites as soon as we can be.\n              In terms of future concerns and challenges, there are supply chain disruptions for us, as we're a vertically integrated company. The spread of PED has caused a significant gap in our production, which will impact hog supply to our HyLife Foods processing facility. As of yesterday, we believe that we've lost 21,000 pigs already to PED, and that will have a direct impact on marketing our pork to our customers. Gaps in production as a result of PED present competitive disadvantages and challenges to our domestic and international customers as far as being able to supply them with pork is concerned.\n              As for our asks, there is the trusted trucker program to seal the trailers at the U.S. border before the trailers come into Manitoba.\n              I have a clarification on washing and so on. You can wash a trailer to different levels. You can wash a trailer and it's still half-dirty. You can wash a trailer so that it's very clean.\n              \n               Our company in Manitoba—but I know a lot of companies in the United States will talk about this too—does a third-party audit of the trailers. Once they are cleaned, washed, and disinfected, we do some swabbing. Then we have a third party come to look to make sure that the washing has been done properly. That's very important. I'm sure that's not being done in the U.S. at most facilities, and it's a real concern.\n              Washing the trailers at the border is not only for PED; it's for future diseases, for the future of the industry. There are a lot of diseases in the U.S. There are different strains of common pig diseases that we don't want to bring across the border."}, {"turn": 84, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Could you conclude shortly, please?"}, {"turn": 85, "speakerID": "233320", "name": "Mr. Claude Vielfaure", "contribution": "Okay, I'll just wrap up.\n              The second thing is to continue to support the CVO office. They have been very helpful. They are running out of resources and testing, and we need continued support of them."}, {"turn": 86, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Vielfaure.\n              Mr. Rempel, you have five minutes."}, {"turn": 87, "speakerID": "233310", "name": "Mr. Bill Rempel (Chief Operating Officer, Steve's Livestock Transport)", "contribution": "Mr. Chairman and committee members, thank you for the opportunity to present here the challenges we are facing with PED in Manitoba, and the fear that lies in the rest of western Canada because we're so integrated.\n              My name is Bill Rempel, and I'm with Steve's Livestock Transport. We are a for-hire livestock transporter. We operate 130 trucks that are on the road on any given day. We have about 400 employees. Eighty per cent of our cargo is hogs. About 70% of that originates out of the Manitoba area, a lot of it in the southeast area. We have terminals in southeastern Manitoba in Blumenort, right where the hot zone is; in western Manitoba in Brandon; and in central Alberta in Red Deer. The majority of our transport is in western Canada, but we go into the United States as well.\n              The current challenge we are facing as a transporter is severe, and it seems to be growing by the day. There are definitely some concerns in our organization as far as the different effects it's having. One of them that hasn't been talked about a lot is the emotional toll it takes on people. Even though we're not directly involved in hog production, we are very impacted by this challenge. With every farm that breaks, there are new zones declared, which means there are logistical challenges and changes for us and for where our trucks move. There is heightened biosecurity and scrutiny on our people who are doing the work every day.\n              The toll and the challenge have been particularly on our logistics staff, our drivers, and our wash employees. A lot of effort is going into route planning. We have had several cases where our trucks are literally sitting at a farm waiting for directions from the different parties, from the CVO, with regard to what route they'll take to leave from there.\n               There is a lot of work and there are a lot of slowdowns happening. A lot of people are working seven days a week to try to make sure we stay on top of this. People are getting tired. When there needs to be this level of heightened awareness and biosecurity that people need to stay on top of, it concerns us.\n              The other challenge we run into is an equipment shortage. We've made the decision to isolate where trailers go and to use specific trailers for high-risk sites. They don't go out of that area; they can only be used there. That effects our efficiencies and utilization of equipment. We can't use those trailers in other areas, so that's created an equipment shortage with regard to trailers.\n              Since the outbreak, cleaning, disinfecting, and mechanical drying of trailers has significantly expanded. As I referred to before, there are different levels of cleaning. It's been ramped up significantly, and the frequency has gone up to the point where, today, our wash facility in Blumenort, Manitoba, is at capacity. We're operating four shifts. We run seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and we're running at capacity.\n              As a reference, generally, on average, it takes about three hours for two people to go through the C and D process for a trailer. It's a lengthy timeframe. All the extra work that goes into this, along with the reduced utilization, has created some limitations, and it is having a financial impact on our organization as well.\n              What we have done as an organization so far is segregate the trailers from high-risk sites. We limit where our trucks go. We are in western Canada, so we have a terminal in Alberta. Trucks there would haul animals back and forth. We've limited where they're allowed to go. Obviously, we've reviewed and updated our biosecurity protocols. We continually adjust and limit routes, and we are looking at how we can expand our washing facility.\n              Since 2013 when the PED virus was first detected in North America, we—and the industry as a whole—have invested heavily to protect ourselves from the PED virus. We have spent millions to expand washing. We designed thermal-assisted drying, which is high heat drying. We bring the temperature of the trailers to 165°F to 170°F. Research has shown that if we keep it there for a minimum of 12 minutes, it will kill the virus.\n              There is a lot that has gone into that. We haven't sat idly by and hoped for the best. We've been very active, and the industry has been very active in trying to control the spread of the virus.\n              \n               I appreciate your taking the time to hear us. The ask on our part, and certainly what could help us, would be to implement the trusted trucker program. That would do three things for us. \n              First, it would reduce the risk. Today, we are washing in the U.S., so when those trailers hit the border they're clean, but the industry is washing them again, so we are going through the complete process again on the Canadian side. That tells you that the wash in the U.S. isn't trusted. The industry doesn't trust it, so we are doing it twice. We strongly feel that it would reduce the risk.\n              Second, it would free up equipment—instead of going out of route, washing the trailers in the U.S., bringing them back, and washing them again.\n              It would certainly reduce the risk, improve our utilization of the equipment, and reduce costs.\n              Thank you for your time."}, {"turn": 88, "speakerID": "218956", "name": "The Chair", "contribution": "Thank you.\n              We'll get right into our question round.\n              Mr. Anderson, you have six minutes."}, {"turn": 89, "speakerID": "224986", "name": "Mr. David Anderson", "contribution": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

I thank all the committee members for attending and for agreeing to an emergency meeting.\n              Thank you to our witnesses, as well.\n              I was very happy to hear Dr. Kochhar state earlier—and I think it's important that Canadians know this—that it is not a food safety or a public health issue. This is an issue for the pork industry that affects our production. That's the issue we are dealing with, and not an issue of food safety.\n              I want to go over the protocol a bit.\n              Mr. Vielfaure, Mr. Rempel, and Mr. Pearce, all three of them, have facilities in my riding, and I am familiar with them. Actually, after Mr. Vielfaure's dad was done being an MLA in the province, he helped the boys, and there was the odd time or two, when I was in the industry, when his dad delivered piglets to my facilities, so I have some experience in the industry as well, having been a producer in the past.\n              We have very strict biosecurity standards in our industry in Manitoba, and that's something that you guys are always working to improve. My understanding is that when you take a load of piglets to the United States, you drop them off at a facility, at a farm, that is presumably virus-free. Your preference is to do what we did in the past, under the special trusted truck protocol: come to the border, seal those trailers, and take them directly to a certified washing station, where they are hot-washed, disinfected, and high-heat dried.\n              The protocol was changed in December. We had that protocol implemented in 2014, when we had an outbreak. It seems to have addressed that situation, and now, after that protocol was relaxed and changed, we have a flare-up of PED again.\n              The problem is this. When you deliver these pigs to a site in the States, your only point of contact is the rear gate of that trailer, and that's minimal contact. Then you drive straight back to the border, you get sealed, and you come back into Canada. When you are being forced to go to a truck wash facility in the United States that is not certified or regulated, they use a firehose approach without high heat; all they do is sprinkle it and rinse it out so it looks clean and satisfies the requirements at the border. As a result, you've really exposed yourself not only to recycled water, which is a common practice down there, but also to a site where all kinds of trailers come from industry and Iowa. We heard before, from the chief veterinary officer, that there is much more of an epidemic of PED in the United States. You've been on a site where there is contamination already, so all kinds of parts of that truck now get infected.\n              Is that the issue that we're talking about?"}, {"turn": 99, "speakerID": "233310", "name": "Mr. Bill Rempel", "contribution": "Yes."}, {"turn": 100, "speakerID": "233320", "name": "Mr. Claude Vielfaure", "contribution": "Correct.

Certainly there are resources in British Columbia that could be brought into Manitoba to help these producers.\n              It's not just a matter of helping them; it's controlling and providing the right solvents for producers to use and how to use them. It's highly technical. Companies such as Maple Leaf and HyLife do it all day long in their plants and on their farms, but smaller producers just don't have that. They're getting frustrated and they need help; they need some communication.\n               They know who to call. The chief veterinarian in Manitoba has done a great job, and I'll be talking to her probably in the next hour. However, the federal government has to re-engage on animal health with the farming community and with processors. \n              I know you've heard us speak about it before, that in terms of animal health broadly, whether it's FMD or classical swine fever, all these diseases are really important and CFIA has to take a bigger and more present role."}, {"turn": 119, "speakerID": "216085", "name": "Mr. Lloyd Longfield", "contribution": "Very good.

We had Mr. Kochhar from CFIA, and he talked about PED being transmitted from one pig to another through direct contact with sick animals.\n              Claude, you were talking about work that is being done in the States and tests that you have done on-site around airborne transmission. That was not in the discussions that we had on the last panel. That's kind of alarming. \n              I know that Mr. Longfield brought it up. Is there work being done on that? You're doing the work. You're investing. I guess it would be a recommendation for the government to better understand how this is transmitted.\n              I wanted to talk a bit about vaccines. How do they work? \n              I know the CFIA said that with emergency approval we're allowing these vaccines to come in; all you have to do is to call your vet, and then they place an order. \n              Where are these vaccines coming from?

As Claude mentioned, they may reduce shedding but they won't reduce disease, and they haven't been broadly used because producers have been trying to eliminate as opposed to control PEDv. \n              That being said—and your question is a good one—VIDO does have a vaccine being produced in Europe right now that might be useful in the coming months. The timeframe is unknown. \n              When Dr. Kochhar mentioned that they will fast-track access to a new vaccine, that might be something on the horizon. But again, while VIDO looked at it from a practical or a scientific perspective, the commercial application is yet to be seen in Canadian herds. There is hope that it could really help in terms of being protective, but right now, the measures of biosecurity, elimination, and cleaning and disinfection are really all we have.

When CFIA was before us in the first panel, I asked about PED being a disease that is monitored federally, and Mr. Kochhar spoke about the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health.\n               Could you talk about the importance of federal leadership in this? Right now, we're talking about Manitoba, but it was in Ontario, and it has been in Quebec. I think there needs to be more federal leadership. I know that the minister spoke out yesterday and said that he was going to work with CFIA and that more would be done and more talk.

I remember that day very well in January 2014. It was actually the University of Guelph animal health laboratory that confirmed the presence of the disease in Ontario, and then we went to work with our industry. We had prepared beforehand with our industry because we saw the situation evolving in the United States. \n              Harpreet is a friend of mine, but unfortunately CFIA wasn't an ongoing partner in those early days. Eventually, they came onboard with some biosecurity help, and then when we started to realize that there was definitely a feed component, they helped us with some degree of testing. It wasn't until the OIE asked the United States to report on their PED situation and Canadians followed suit that the CFIA really did engage at the farm at the provincial level.\n              In response to your question—I know it's a windy answer—I don't think the CFIA has a strong animal health presence. I think they need to re-engage in emerging diseases. We made it an immediately notifiable disease with our lab and our veterinarians in Ontario, as did Quebec, Manitoba, and Alberta; and it does stand the test of being a federally regulated disease, reportable, notifiable. What box you want to put it in can be a matter of debate. But on an emerging situation in Canada that's affecting more provinces, that can affect producers across the country, affect the economy, communities, animals, the federal government has a mandate; and it needs to be accountable to its mandate.

Now they are coming more and more frequently—whether it's PED or BSE. I was very involved in BSE in the early 2000s, H1N1, avian influenza, a whole host of them. Ebola was a threat to us a few years ago, and SARS. Animal health in Canada is a constant threat. At the federal level it is really, in my mind, hard to fathom where it sits. Right now CFIA reports to Health Canada, and animal health seems to be orphaned there since they aren't reporting as directly to Ag Canada.\n              I know they're working on a strategy. It's an interesting document. It says what we've already known for many years, but operationally the CFIA seems to be absent in responding to these clear and present dangers around the world. I think it is time. The PED situation in Manitoba really highlights the fact that there needs to be a constant federal presence. I'm not saying they have to be the primary leader, but their role has has to be collaborative with all levels of government. Municipalities have a role in disposal. The industry has a strong role to play, but the federal government needs to re-engage on animal health, and this particular situation is just one of a list of situations that we're seeing.\n              Right now we're seeing a renewed outbreak of rabies in southwestern Ontario, and that used to be a federal disease. The federal government was there front and centre, and they are taking a backseat now to provincial authorities, which is sad because that particular disease does affect human health.
